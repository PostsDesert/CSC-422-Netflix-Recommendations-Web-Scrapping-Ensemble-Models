The very familiar \"Goodnight, Moon\" opens and closes this short, and captures real-life children commenting on sleep and dreams, both good and bad. So refreshing; the children are absolutely captivating! Our daughter is in her 30s, but my spouse and I watched this several times, and when I spoke to my daughter to tell her about it, we both recited \"Goodnight, Moon\" from memory, and it brought back a tidal wave of \"Remember when\"s from both of us.\n\nDo watch it and share it with friends and family, both little and grown!",
