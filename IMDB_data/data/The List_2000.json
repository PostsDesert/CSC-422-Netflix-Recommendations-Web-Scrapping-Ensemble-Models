It was much better than the film. Seriously, don't waste your money!!! The writing was **utterly** cliché and boring. I wondered if perhaps an adolescent boy wrote and directed this one. The acting was stunted, awkward and just plain ol' bad. Who were the characters? Who cares!!! And the sets reminded me of 80's noir, with the lighting through mini-blinds - eeeeyuk!\n\nI must have said, \"why am I watching this??\" about 6 times before rewinding. It wasn't sexy, it wasn't thrilling and it wasn't worth making.\n\nOh God it was so bad!!! Not even 'good' bad. Just bad.",
