In fact Koterski in all his movies has the same character Adao Mia³czyñski who is a sad, tragic character not able to deal with his own life not to mention the responsibility for other things. You can say that this kind of aesthetic is not for you but you can't say it's stupid. I hate polish comedies but comparing this movie to \"Road Trip\" or othe American Pies movies is like comparing Truman Show to Ace Ventura.This is rather a satire on the polish movie industry and the role and life of an artist (movie director) Great thing, maybe not as brilliant and innovative as Koterski latest \"Dzieñ Owira\" but really stands out from all the crap served by polish producers.",
