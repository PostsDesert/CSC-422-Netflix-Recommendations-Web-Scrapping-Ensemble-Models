It is intense it's a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. And the movie is also impossible to predict what will happen. I not giving out the storyline because this is a movie that everyone needs to see. I give this movie 5 Stars ***** bravo well done. And another thing is when you leave the movie theater you will have 1 question on your mind. (The question will be) What would you due if one day your entire life as you knew it comes to a crashing end? Thats all I'm giving out.\n\nThe movie will be out on video and DVD on August 31, 2004."
