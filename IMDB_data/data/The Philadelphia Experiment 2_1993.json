        "reviewBody": "In 1943, the United States tests an anti-radar system to make the U. S. Navy ships invisible to the enemy. Dr. James Longstreet uses his experiment in the destroyer escort USS Eldridge that disappears from Philadelphia. The sailors David Herdeg (Michael Paré) and his best friend Jim Parker (Bobby Di Cicco) are projected to 1984, where they meet Allison Hayes (Nancy Allen). They unsuccessfully try to contact their base and out of the blue Jimmy disappears in a hospital. Allison helps David to visit Jimmy's wife Pamela, but Jimmy refuses to see him. Now David's only hope is meeting Dr. James Longstreet to learn what to do. Will he be well succeeded?\n\n\"The Philadelphia Experiment\" is an enjoyable film with a story with paradoxes, like most of the stories about time travel. The conclusion is corny and romantic, but works well. The military team in the Jeep shooting David and Allison in their car during the persecution through the highway is ridiculous. But anyway this film is still a great entertainment after so many years. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Projeto Filadélfia\" (\"Philadelphia Project\")\n\nNote: On 08 July 2022, I saw this film again.",
