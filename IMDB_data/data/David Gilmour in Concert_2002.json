I don't know that there has been a concert enjoyed my so many of our friends who have never listened to much of Pink Floyd. So, even if you don't care much for Pink or you haven't listened much to Pink... you can still appreciate this DVD concert.\n\nThe guitar pickin'... use of the varied instruments, the choral group, and the relaxing style of music make this a must have DVD in my opinion.\n\nThe video quality is just okay... nothing spectacular, but the camera work is done very well.\n\nThe sound quality is where I believe this DVD shines... it is nothing short of awesome in DD 5.1, however a stereo track is available for those who would rather listen in stereo.",
