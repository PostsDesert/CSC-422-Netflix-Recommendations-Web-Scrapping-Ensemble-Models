This is about Sublime. I have been listening to them since i was maybe 10 or 11 as well. I'm now 17.. i have seen many documentaries on musicians and bands that members have passed away. This one by far is the most uplifting one. It brings them back to life its really great. they talk about Brad and his love for animals.. what they did at Dennys... A Grip of footage from various performances, \"steppin' razor\" music video with some homeless dude dancing around.. and of course \"Sorry sir, I've had too much goddamn Orange Juice\".",
