        "reviewBody": "I too thought Elaan was interesting, although the musical songs didn't particularly stand out. The cast were all good-looking -- Arjun Rampal, John Abraham, Lara Dutta, Amisha Patel, and even Rahul Khanna were all nice to look at. As far as the action scenes, some of the stuff was interesting in a \"Sword of Gideon\" type of way, but it was all over-the-top in a way that's typical of all Indian movies. It was nice to see some of India's best bodies and faces altogether in a scenic European backdrop. Even the mobster guy projected a unique malevolence. I think that a lot of Indian critics typically base their praise or criticism of any movie based on how politically correct it is. If it has any type of politically serious tone to it (eg. anti-terrorism) instead of the usual frivolous fantasy fluff, then there are a lot of left-wing writers who'll pounce to make any nitpick they can. So I'd say it's an entertaining over-the-top action thriller, but don't try to bash it by comparing it to Shakespeare."
