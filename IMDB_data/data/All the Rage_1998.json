        "reviewBody": "this film is different as a score of people discover things about themselves and others that they didn't know and how to use a gun.\n\nat first i must admit it was a slow flick, but i like these movies where the point of view changes from one character to another with their own little side stories, only to find that they are all really connected. \n\n this is a fun movie that deals with the reality of guns in the united states and how harmful they can be in the wrong hands. a terrific message put to use in a very strange story...i give it two thumbs up in the origionality department and another two thumbs up for anna paquin, who goes from the silent and scared ROGUE in the X-MEN movie, to a trashy whore who just happens to be underage and loving it.",
