Sure, we don't see Jogger Guy again (heck, he's not even credited on the IMDb), but his presence is a good omen for the rest of the movie.\n\nOh yeah, there's some good dialogue in it as well, especially if you're into pop culture references (which I am) and you live or have lived in Tulsa, Oklahoma (which I do). Although, the city's not as bad as Wade says it is. Consider it artistic license on his part, I guess.\n\nIt's a good li'l indie flick, and you shan't be going awry if you decide to pick it up. If you can find it, that is.",
