Though I stumbled upon a great find, the movie itself is worth the few bucks to rent. A real good cast as well of young actors and actresses who are trying to shine out and get noticed. The story is about \"Nick\" a guy who is obsessed with murder. His friends think he's a little strange, taking after his professor. Well his ex girl hooked up with his best buddy who comes from a very well off family. Nick acted like everything was all gravy and since it was his last night in town (literally!) he decides to throw him a party! And all of his friends are invited... only thing is, not everyone is going home in one piece!"
