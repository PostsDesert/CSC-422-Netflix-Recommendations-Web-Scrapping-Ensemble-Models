Fortunately, not too late, as I think I still have enough time remaining on this planet to hunt up and watch all of his other films.\n\nI'm getting a real chuckle out of reading all the one-star reviews here by people who just don't \"get it\". I don't blame them, really, but there should be some way of warning them not to do it; not to embarrass themselves by displaying their shallowness. If it's slick predigested Hollywood pap liberally peppered with explosions they're looking for, they're in the wrong place.\n\nHal Hartley rules. If he's made better films than \"Amateur\" then I'm in for a real treat.",
