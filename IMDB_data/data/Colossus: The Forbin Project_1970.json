        "reviewBody": "\"Colossus: The Forbin Project\" integrates two familiar themes--a Cold War \"Doomsday\" scenario, and computers that run amok--to produce a truly engrossing thriller.\n\nIn a top-secret Pentagon project, American computer scientist Dr. Charles Forbin builds a great supercomputer, \"Colossus,\" to control America's entire nuclear forces automatically. The Soviets soon follow with their own supercomputer, \"Guardian,\" to control their own forces.\n\n\"Colossus\" then stuns Forbin by issuing a \"request\" to set up communication with \"Guardian,\" perhaps to learn more about it. And that's when Dr. Forbin makes his fatal mistake. His scientific curiosity and love for his \"child\" overwhelms him too, and he gets the President to approve the communication.\n\nColossus and Guardian begin communicating, soon exchanging data in a new language of their own devising that no human being can understand.\n\nFearing what may be happening, the U.S. and U.S.S.R. attempt to break the communication link. But Colossus and Guardian react by launching nuclear missiles at various targets to force the humans to keep the link open--and to do whatever else they command. It becomes clear that the two computers are now conspiring with each other--against the rest of humanity.\n\nThe rest of the movie is a fascinating battle of wits between the human designers of the machines, who must now try to find a way to defeat machines they had just spent ten years making invincible, and the Colossus-Guardian computers with their own rapidly developing plans for the future of humankind.\n\nThe moral of this movie makes an interesting contrast with the moral of \"Forbidden Planet.\" \"Forbidden Planet\" showed that no matter how advanced our civilization gets technologically, we can't escape the \"monsters\" buried deeply in the baser instincts of our subconscious. \"Colossus\" showed that we can't escape hubris or \"Murphy's Law\" either."
