Dennis Hopper does NOT give - as Leonard Maltin says - a \"glorified cameo\" - but brings a superb supporting performance to the film. But it is Gary Oldman who soars above the realm of \"acting\", who is STARTLING in his performance. This genius of an actor should've received awards, accolades, and acclaim for one of the most incredible performances I've ever seen on screen.\n\nIf you are a true movie-lover, please take the time to view this brilliantly acted story. Perhaps we can all then get together to get Mr. Oldman his due for a KILLER performance. He certainly deserves it.",
