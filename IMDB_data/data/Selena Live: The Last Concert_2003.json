She sang like 17 songs, and gave her all in every single one.She's better than most performers today.She sings with her heart and you could tell she really loved singing and entertaining.\n\nShe has such cool dance moves and seeing her dance makes me want to dance.She had so much energy and talent in her.She is truly a Tejano legend that will forever be remembered. I recommend this concert to all Selena fans.",
