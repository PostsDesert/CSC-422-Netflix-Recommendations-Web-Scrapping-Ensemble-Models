        "reviewBody": "This is a decent anime for the Wild Arms games. The only thing is there is not much to connect it to the games. It is a stand alone story with a few nods to the games (such as the wild west setting and the ARMs) but it is a good story. The story centers around on Sheyanne Rainstorm, a gunslinger who is shot and apparently killed only to later wake up and find himself in the body of a ten year old boy. He then goes on a quest to find his body and encounters several other characters(such as two female thieves who never actually really succeed in stealing anything) and a mysterious doctor who accompanies him along on his travels. The plot seems simple in the very beginning but near the end of the series the door is open and all that you thought you knew is not as it seems. My only complaint is the ending theme. The beginning theme is OK for it does sound western but the ending theme does not fit at all. Other than that this is a entertaining anime with great story telling and some good twists mixed in.",
