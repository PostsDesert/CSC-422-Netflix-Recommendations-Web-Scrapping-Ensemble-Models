        "reviewBody": "I really liked this show and I was heart broken when they cancelled it to make room for family guy even though I really like family guy. A lot of people don't like this show and I guess I can see why. It has a very dry humor to it which I persoanlly find very funny. Its not like your typical animated show like simpsons or family guy where crazy stuff is always happening. No its more like a live action show very realistic and it just shows people living their lives.\n\nThis show is about a propane salesman named Hank Hill who lives in the fictional town of Arlen Texas. He lives next door to his three best friends as they take on the tasks of live together from raising their kids to drinking beers in the alley.\n\nI know the premise sounds kind of slow and dry and don't get me wrong it is but its still very enjoyable. This show only has two kind of viewers people who really like it or people that absolutely hate it there is no ladder. I say take a gamble on this one though folks watch a couple episodes see what you think because it really is good.",
