It is not for everyone - especially if you are not \"young & pure at heart\" (or at least long to be). This Disney film is about a young girl and her joyous, Christian outlook on life. Her view & beliefs turn the town around. Hayley Mills was a wonderful young actress who also starred in Parent Trap (original), Summer Magic, That Darn Cat, etc. I have to make this review at least 10 lines - so I'll just end by saying that I hope this becomes a family favorite in your house, as it is in ours.",
