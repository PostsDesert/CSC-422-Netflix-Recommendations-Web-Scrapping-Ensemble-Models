        "reviewBody": "Reincarnation is the one word which can be used to describe Karan Arjun, a film which can easily be a fun watch for the entire family. It is about two brothers who are killed and their mother who expects to see them again for some reason and desperately prays for the day they come back. And her prayers get paid off when her children are reborn in different parts of the country and grow up looking the same as her dead kids. The film has some heartbreaking feel about it, but as a film, it is a bit overdone, melodramatic and cheesy. Yet, it never takes itself too seriously, so it somehow works despite being blown out of proportions. The film may particularly appeal to children - heroes and villains, fights and races, dialogue which does not have much sense, very caricaturish characters. Despite that, there are some emotions that somehow work for others, so I would call it a children's film which may appeal to the rest of the family. Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan work very well together and give the film a certain appeal not warranted by the script. Salman is restrained as never before and Shahrukh is carefree and positive. Raakhee does well as the suffering mom and the moment of unity is such a familiar tear-causing scene that nothing else matters. Mamta and Kajol are hardly there, particularly Kajol, who is invisible. Rajesh Roshan's music is as always amazing, with \"Yeh Bandhan\" leading the list. All in all, go and try this wholesome Bollywood entertainment.",
