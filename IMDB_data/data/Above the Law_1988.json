        "reviewBody": "I will never describe Steven Seagal as being an actor because he has no idea what that entails. He merely fits the bill regarding the requirements of being an action hero. He has the perfect knack for dozing his way through a film. However, in the early days of his movie career, Seagal successfully displayed his skills in the martial arts style of Akido. This was when he was in good shape, physically speaking. The opening scene in the dojo impressed me when Steven Seagal demonstrates his own style of martial arts in front of his students. His hand speed and his timing is on a par with that of Bruce Lee near enough. The story is very standard so I won't mention anything of what happens. Henry Silva makes for a creepy and sinister villain, he was always very good at playing those kinds of characters. The action scenes are capably handled and it helps that the lead is a professional martial artist. In my opinion, Steven Seagal made his best films from 1988 to about 1995 before weight gain cast a shadow over his career. The director of \"Above the Law\" was the same person who made Seagal's best film, \"Under Siege.\"",
