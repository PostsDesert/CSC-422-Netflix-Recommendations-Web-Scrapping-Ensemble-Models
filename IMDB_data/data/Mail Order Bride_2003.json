        "reviewBody": "I had the chance to preview a film titled MAIL ORDER BRIDE at a film seminar held by prestigious NYU film professor Dr Richard Brown. I thought the movie was one of the funniest and entertaining movies I have seen in a very long time. Dr. Richard Brown interviewed the young man you stars and directed the movie prior to the screening. He was very charming, funny and filled with hope. After the film, he brought up the producer and co-writer. He was a man from Moscow, Russia. I was so fascinated by what these two had been through and accomplished. Their drive and energy was so positive, I had to shake their hand and congratulate them on a job well done. It is not everyday an American and a Russian get together and make a film, especially on an independent level. I can't believe they shot half the movie in Moscow. It is nice to see people come from nothing and try to make it. This should be an inspiration to us all."
