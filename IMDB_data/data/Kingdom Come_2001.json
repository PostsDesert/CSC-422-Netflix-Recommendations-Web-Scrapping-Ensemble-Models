I had never even HEARD of it before so it was a nice surprise. It has a real family feel to it; you will definitely walk away grinning and feeling good! This must be the 4th film in the past few months where I've seen Anthony Anderson crack up the place, and the rest of the cast are no slouches, either. Every character is a gem with no false notes - highly recommended!"
