I was moved by the way they started with the Union Jack as a backdrop and then replaced it at a dramatic moment with the Stars and Stripes (I think during Baba O'Reilly). That was followed with the US and British flags side by side, depicting the solidarity between our two nations, not just post-9/11 but really extending back in time to the musical British invasion in the sixties, and further still to WWII. The array of artists who turned out was similarly impressive. From David Bowie to Destiny's Child to Bon Jovi to Five for Fighting to Paul McCartney, it was quite a lineup. I would watch again anytime.",
