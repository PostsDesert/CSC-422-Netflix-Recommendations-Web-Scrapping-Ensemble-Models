With that said, let's talk about how funny this movie is.\n\nFrench Stewart and Bridgette Wilson star in this satrical, un-romantic comedy. From first frame to fade-out, LOVE STINKS will make you laugh harder than you have in a long while.\n\nSeth (Stewart) and Chelsea (Wilson) are madly in love with each other. Problem is: Chelsea wants to get married and Seth doesn't. Coming up with a compromise, they say that if they are still together in a year, they will get married. When the year goes by, and Seth still doesn't want marriage, Chelsea wants revenge.\n\nThis movie is nothing like what you are expecting it to be. See it and discover for yourself the film that truly lets you know what Hell is like. LOVE STINKS gets 5/5."
