        "reviewBody": "Having seen this performance live in Atlantic City, I was anticipating a very good DVD. Having recently watched it again Its absolutely fantastic the way the producers packaged this performance. Sarah is at her best. The closeups, the expanded scenes, etc. are brilliant. Just watching Sarah strut down the ramp prior to her singing \"What a Wonderful World\" high up on a swing is worth the price of the video. This wonderful performance should be shown to anyone who has not seen or heard Sarah Brightmans beautiful voice. Only she can reach the heights of operatic magic and come off brilliantly with her version of \"Dust in the Wind\". Other reviewers might have watched the wrong DVD. The only appearance of Phathom music was a brief lead in to \"wishing you were here again\". Her mixture of soprano and pop was just perfect. This DVD is one that can be watched over and over. Recommended very highly.",
