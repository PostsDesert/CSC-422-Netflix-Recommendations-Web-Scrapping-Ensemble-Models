I felt I HAD to: it had Nick Nolte, Richard Dreyfuss and Bette Midler, and was directed by Paul Mazursky. How could it miss? And I was right - it was great.\n\nSo, why did the series go so wrong?\n\nWell, there were inferior story-lines all the while it aired, and while I respect Hector Elizondo, he was simply too good for the \"exasperated husband\" role he had to replay each week. And Tim Thomerson... well, he's no Nick Nolte.\n\nBut the only good thing I remember was Anita Morris. Now, SHE was the main reason I watched the show. I'd watch her in anything, and very nearly have. She was so sexy, had a great husky voice and such a cute down-home drawl for a Beverly Hills society maven(!), and that body...(deep breath), okay, where was I?\n\nYes, Anita was the main reason I watched this movie and was probably the only redeeming factor in the whole mess. She was funny AND sexy, always a good combo. But as for the rest, it was at least true to the \"Down and Out\" part.\n\nTwo stars for the \"Down and Out in Beverly Hills\" series, just for Anita Morris. As is usually the case, stick with the original."
