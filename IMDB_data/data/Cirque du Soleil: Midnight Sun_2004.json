You'll love this gravity defying spectacle!!!!\n\nIt has a bit of everything for everyone, Clown that will have you laughing, Stunts that will leave you in awe. With such things as Aerial silk dancing, to trampoline, and even bike tricks for the men of the family! But please don't think you can just go outside and do the same things gentlemen! lol . And what they call the Power Track, which is amazing, And beautiful music that is very touching and moving. And does tell a story, \n\nTo really have the true experience, you'll have to go to Walt Disney World, Downtown Disney West Side to be exact, Disney owns the rights to La Nouba and this show cannot be seen anywhere else. Other than the T.V of course, Prepair to be Wowed!",
