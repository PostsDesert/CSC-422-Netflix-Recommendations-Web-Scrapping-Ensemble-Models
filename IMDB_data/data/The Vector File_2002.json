They did a great job and their daughter was precious and did a great job acting with her dad and mother. It had action and mystery. It's not a blockbuster but it did its job of keeping me entertained. It doesn't last very long but it's a good popcorn just chill movie to watch. They did such a sweet job acting together that I want to Google to see if they have anymore together. It's nice to see a movie that doesn't have half naked people and constant cursing in it for once.",
