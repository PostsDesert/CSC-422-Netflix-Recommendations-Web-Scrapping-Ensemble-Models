        "reviewBody": "YUEN CHI MIU HEI (or BODY WEAPON) contains such humiliating and extremely degrading depictions of rape that it makes the rape scenes in the Charles Bronson movies of the 1980's appear to be innocent Charlie Brown cartoons by comparison.\n\nIt seems that Hong Kong police officers are trained to arrest perpetrators by standing close to them face-to-face and holding out a gun in easy reach. It seems that Hong Kong police officers are not allowed to use weapons in their homes. It seems that Hong Kong police officers are trained to not use weapons when they are outnumbered by the bad guys. Sick rape scenes are mixed together with light comedy. The plot is confused and muddy. Very little makes sense.",
