One day at lunch Tracy see's an attractive wedding planner who leaves her notebook behind.He tracks her down (Desiree) and this is where the fun begins.The characters are all right on point.Mrs.Jones as the horny boss.Desiree as the unsuspecting girlfriend.The gay co worker who wants to turn Tracy out.The seemingly happily married co worker who likes to visit strip bars.And the black guy wannabee who is white who has a different girl for every day of the week.I give it 4 stars!"
