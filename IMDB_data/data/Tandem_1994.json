It's basically a chance encounter between two men, the older of whom drives the stilted conversation and subsequent journey they share. Intercut into this are scenes of both men having sex. One is married and cheating on his wife, the other is the third wheel in someone else's relationship (as best I could tell!). The combined result is rather surreal, and comes to a somewhat predictable ending. The subtitled version I saw did have excellent translations, particularly english idioms."
