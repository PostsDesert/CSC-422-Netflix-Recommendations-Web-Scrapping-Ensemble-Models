Zenigata this time around is more serious in capturing Lupin, and is actually successful. Overall there's more action and seriousness than funny parts but it's a movie that I recommend. It's a 7.5 for me.\n\nNow I have to exceed the limit: Despite the different art style, which isn't bad by any means, this is a great film. Interesting story and lots of action.
