        "reviewBody": "I am amazed by the amount of people who have discussed this movie in the terms of being about \"mental illness\".... it should become clear by the end of the movie that this is a fantasy, Fred is not an imaginary friend he is \"real\" he exists and his sole purpose in life is to help children in a dark place and bring them out of themselves. Imaginary friends do not move on to another child, imaginary friends are the property of those who imagine them. I wouldn't be at all surprised if I saw a review of \"Gremlins\" on here by the same people who said \"nasty little creatures who create distruction around them are not funny\". This is a funny movie, plain and simple. Rick Mayall is outstanding as Fred and Phoebe Cates gives the perfect performance as the downtrodden daughter and wife. Anyone who says bad things about this movie has obviously never seen a fantasy movie before and taken it for what it is. I am surprised that they didn't call Demi Moore delusional in \"Ghost\" because she was refusing to let go of her boyfriend and \"imagined\" all the stuff that went on. This is a fantasy folks, a pure unadulterated fantasy and it is a bloody funny one at that. Watch it, it will make you laugh, it will make you smile, and it will make you chuckle.... what more can you ask and again Rick Mayall is brilliant."
