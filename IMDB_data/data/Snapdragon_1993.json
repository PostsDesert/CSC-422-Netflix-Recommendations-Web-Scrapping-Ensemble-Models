Two of this B-grade thriller's biggest problems are it's complete lack of any suspenseful action and intrigue and it's pitiful budget. The performances aren't bad, but I hate how Pamela was undeniably exploited and underused in her role as a blonde beauty with amnesia. A few interesting themes are used to give the film a cheap feeling of mysticism, but definately nothing substantial.",
