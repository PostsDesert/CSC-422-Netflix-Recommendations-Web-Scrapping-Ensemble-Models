        "reviewBody": "This DVD is: stupid, harsh, disgusting, foul, perverted, horrible, wrong, sick, nasty, gross, politically incorrect, sexist, homophobic, sophomoric, and absolutely hilarious. Sure, Artie comes across as a drunken moron who doesn't care about anything, and if you ask me, its refreshing. No holds barred gross out humor with little to no redeeming qualities, just what the world needs. Even liberals I've shown this to laughed hard at it, though they denied it afterwards. This is not something you watch with the family, this is really, really hardcore comedy. I've never played a standup DVD for a group of drunken friends and seen the reactions that I saw to this DVD, people were rolling on the ground laughing. Artie Lange is the patron saint for ignorant drunkards everywhere! A must see for fans of flat out offensive comedy.",
