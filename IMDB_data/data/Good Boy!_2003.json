I wouldn't want to think about meandering through things with out my dog, a Boxer named Boo, wadded on my lap or curled at my knees at night. My best friend, unconditional love. Sappy story line, atrocious acting ... great dogs. The \"I think that was a ball\" scene is superb if you share your world with a dog.\n\nBad movie, nice nuggets for those who understand, and are blown away, how dogs and people mesh. Those who might be on to the archeology that we and domesticated dogs have been sharing lives for 250,000 years.\n\n\"I'm certain that was a ball\""
