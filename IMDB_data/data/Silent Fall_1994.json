Very Strange Things happen in this movie, but yes, I think kind of things like this happen in reality, even worst. At least in Mexico all the time happens wild things with people more than in nature by itself. The actors plays their roles very well. Since long time ago, I didn't see Richard Dreyfuss, and was a pleasure for me, to see this actor again. Linda Hamilton had a very short role, but Liv Tyler is awesome. Maybe sometimes sounds like illogical, specially when the witness boy, make all this voices. Looks like unreal, but maybe this could happen. Anyway, I found this movie, because I'm always looking for Stewart Copeland music, since many years ago...",
