        "reviewBody": "Yes Cliff Burton, one of the greatest bassists ever who sadly died before his talent could be greatly appreciated. In this collection of videos you get and inside look at who Cliff really was. You see home videos, concert clips and jam sessions. As you see his jaw dropping bass solos. Not only that but you get the chance to see a legendary band in their early years before the mainstream took them away and fed their egos until that was all that they had. Before napster, before St.Anger. The early years... the good years. From Kill em' all to Master of puppets marvel at the greatness of this band, marvel at the talent of Cliff Burton. 8/10 Great look at a great band in the early years.",
