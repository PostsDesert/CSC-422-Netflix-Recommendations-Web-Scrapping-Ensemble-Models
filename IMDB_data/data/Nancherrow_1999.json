        "reviewBody": "A disappointment as a followup to Coming Home there just didn't seem to be much of a point to any of it. Emily Mortimer, who was the focus of the first as Judith is replaced here and made a minor supporting character which is bad news. Bad because the actress that replaced her is dull as dishwater and bad because it makes the whole series lose it's focus with her sidelined. Joanna Lumley and Susan Hampshire are still fine as always but they are on the fringes of the story. As with most British productions the attention to detail is excellent in both costuming and settings but this is a middling show and a bit of a dull viewing experience.",
