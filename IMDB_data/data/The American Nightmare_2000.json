Director interviews are intermixed with footage from their films as well as news footage from the era to provide a bit more insight than is usually provided to horror movies. A great documentary that gives deeper meaning to many of the most popular horrific films of these turbulent decades. Very interesting and informative and just might make you look at all horror films in a new light."
