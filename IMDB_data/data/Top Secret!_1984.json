        "reviewBody": "Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer) is a big star of the gun-happy surfer culture with his smash hit Skeet Surfing. He goes to East Germany to play at a festival. He comes to help resistance member Hillary Flammond on the run. He is imprisoned and beaten. He manages to escape to a secret lab with Hillary's father Dr. Paul Flammond who is forced to develop a secret weapon against submarines.\n\nThe team of Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker follow their highly successful Airplane! with this spoof of a Presley and spy movie. It has the same sense of irreverent fun. Val Kilmer is pretty good but there is nobody equivalent to Leslie Nielsen in this movie. Also going back to Elvis Presley from the 60s is not as immediate as the disaster movies that were still in the conversation of the day. Overall, it's a fun little film.",
