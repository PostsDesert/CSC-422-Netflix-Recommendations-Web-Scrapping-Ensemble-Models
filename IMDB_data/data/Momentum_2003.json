        "reviewBody": "The films of the Science Fiction Channel ( Sci-Fi Channel ) have become boringly predictable. The seem low on budget, originality, and plot.\n\nIn this creation the government is out to get a bunch of telekinetics and recruits a poor soul by devious means to help. There is plenty of over worked recycled twists on evil government organization theme. black coats, shadows, short meaningless lines make these one dimensional cartoons.\n\nDaniel Dae Kim stands out as a good actor in a small role. He brings a bit of the style of his \"Angel\" character to the role. It is hard to miss the link that his \"Crusade\" character was a telepath and this is a film on telekinetics. Was this a Sci-Fi casting move to try and draw fans from the other show? Who knows. Thankfully he is a decent actor and a pleasure to watch.\n\nThe movie is definitely low budget. It reflects The Sci-Fi Channels current model of Canadian location, few well known characters, few effects, and woefully terrible plot and character development. One would think they believe science fiction fans will view anything labeled \"scifi.\"\n\nIf you want a good telekinesis movie, check out \"the Fury\" ( 1978).",
