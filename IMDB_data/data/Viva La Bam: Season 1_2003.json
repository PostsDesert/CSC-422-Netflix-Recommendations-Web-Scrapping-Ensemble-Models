        "reviewBody": "When Viva La Bam premiered on MTV, I was quite excited about it. It was a funny and inventive show with unique concept. And I liked Bam, his parents and his friends as characters. The first season was strong overall, but it already hinted at the problem the show has: It's just very repetitive. There are only so many things you can do with this kind of reality concept, and it doesn't hold your attention anymore, once you've seen several episodes.\n\nWhen the show started, I was puzzled about whether the show was \"acted\" or if it was all for real. I think it's obvious by now that Viva La Bam is indeed a scripted and acted show. Reactions often seem forced, and the more you watch the show, the easier it is to see all the seams.\n\nAll in all it's a pretty good show, but I can't get excited about it anymore. It's too repetitive, and has very little replay value. Hopefully Bam will move on the other things soon, because Viva La Bam is getting a bit stale."
