        "reviewBody": "The first two Broly movies were pretty decent. The first one was insane, followed by the second, which was alright, but that's where they should have just stopped. This third installment in the Broly series known as Bio Broly is nothing but a worthless piece of crap that isn't worth the watch. The only reason I watched it, after hearing it sucked from my friends, was out of curiosity. But now that I did, I regret every minute of it. Nothing but an abomination to DBZ.\n\nThe story is that a former rival of Hercule wants revenge for ruining his dream of Martial Arts. His plan includes resurrecting the Legendary Super Saiyan Broly as a biotechnology monster. So, Trunks, Goten, Krillin, 18, and even Hercule team up to fight this monster.\n\nWon't you just be excited to see Hercule fighting, great start, right? Wrong!\n\nWhere do I begin? First off, its short, so there's so much limit inside that you never feel excited. It takes place in one single location, and the fight scene is pathetically short and stupid. Just the whole idea and premise is pointless. They could have easily concluded the Broly series with the second, a perfect ending. But no, they had to include Broly like a monster, and they also had to include Hercule. Are you joking me? Its like that's the one reason for making a third one, to include Hercule, and Hercule sucks!!!\n\nThe one somewhat decent thing about it is that it includes Android 18, who is insanely hot! I forgot how hot she was, so when I saw her, I was like, yeah baby, do your thing.\n\nOther than that, this movie is not worth it. Curiosity killed the cat, well, curiosity killed my ass!",
