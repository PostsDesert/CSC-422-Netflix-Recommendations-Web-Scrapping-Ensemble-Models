        "reviewBody": "I'm sure people may have dismissed this movie as a nazi tribute to white power. On the contrary, it gives an excellent picture of what happens when powerless people try to find some control over their lives. Nazi-ism itself is scapegoating and blame disguised as fascism, and this movie uses it to paint a picture of desolation and desperation.\n\nWhite power and immigrant-hatred are not what this movie is about. It's about friendship and the need to belong to something. Russell Crowe's Hando is powerful - I couldn't take my eyes off of him. Hando uses that magnetism to draw people into his ideology, thus creating control and power for himself. Things begin to unravel when Gabe, the girl who comes between Hando and Davey, throws off the hold Hando has enjoyed over his little crowd. Remember what Orwell says: Absolute Power corrupts absolutely? Well, so does arrogance. Arrogance and the lack of respect for one's fellow man, regardless of race or creed, are key players in this plot.\n\nI wish there had been more of Davey (Daniel Pollock) in this film, and I'm sorry to have learned of his real-life suicide in the weeks after it's completion. I recommend this film to people who are interested in how poverty, ignorance, and powerlessness change people into strange earthly demons capable of indiscriminate violence."
