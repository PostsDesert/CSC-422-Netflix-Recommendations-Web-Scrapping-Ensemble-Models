        "reviewBody": "There are so many good things about this show. One definite thing is that it is absolutely perfect for children and adults. The animation is so fluid and has a sophisticated look. The music, especially the theme tune is not only catchy, but it is memorable and fun. The story lines are original, and the scripts have plenty of humour and heart. Plus I loved the characters. Who cannot love Paddington, everyone's favourite Peruvian bear? While nearly always finding himself in trouble, he is still so lovable. The other characters are great too, Henry, Jonathan, Isabelle, Mr Curry and Mrs Bird. Also the voices are perfect, Michael Hordern does a great job as the narrator, but special mention has to go to Jonathan Kydd who was perfection as Paddington. In conclusion, this show is wonderful! 10/10 Bethany Cox",
