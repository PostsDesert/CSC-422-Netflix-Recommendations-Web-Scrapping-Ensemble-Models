        "name": "Rock Hudson scores as a hypochondriac...",
        "reviewBody": "Rock Hudson is in his element here--a situation comedy that's got some clever lines built around the theme that he's a hypochondriac who mistakenly believes he has only a few weeks to live--and wants to put certain issues in order believing that his wife needs another man as soon as he's gone. The \"other man\" that he and Tony Randall choose turns out to be Clint Walker, his wife's old flame from school days.\n\nWith the help of a fairly amusing script and some well played bits by Paul Lynde (as a dedicated undertaker) and Edward Andrews (as a doctor who thinks the specialists get all the breaks), Rock Hudson makes the most of his central role and actually gives the most polished comic performance of his career. Tony Randall does well as his gin-guzzling neighbor who promises to deliver a eulogy for him. And Doris Day (despite wearing what looks to be the worst looking wig since Barbara Stanwyck's blonde hairdo in \"Double Indemnity\") uses her own comic flair with style--but personally, I've enjoyed her much more in her other roles with Hudson, especially \"Pillow Talk\". The focus here is on Hudson and he makes the most of a well-written comic role.\n\nSince one of the writers on the script is Julius J. Epstein, it's no wonder that there's a fresh, smooth-flowing flavor to the proceedings. Not the kind of film you should go out of your way to catch, but it passes the time pleasantly. Epstein worked on some great scripts ranging from \"The Strawberry Blonde\" to \"Light in the Piazza\" and his deft writing style is evident here."
