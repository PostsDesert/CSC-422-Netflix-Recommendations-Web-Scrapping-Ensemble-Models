        "reviewBody": "First and foremost, this movie is absolutely hilarious. If you haven't seen it, rent it and enjoy. I envy you for the experience you will have. \n\nThis movie has a very young Steve Buscemi, and he's at his best. Seymore Casselle's performance is both as funny and as powerful as his role was in Minnie and Moskowitz, and that's as big of a compliment as I could give to anyone. \n\nThe direction here is impeccable. Music is both romantic, sad and moving without it ever being heavy-handed. The pacing is neither rushed nor is it ever slow. The story feels as unpredictable as life only much more interesting. Rockwell clearly takes tips from Fellini and makes it into an American original. \n\nIf you like Bottle Rockets, Strangers in Paradise, Clerks, Bill Hicks, Daniel Johnston, James BrownÂ…basically if you have any soul in your body, you will adore this movie.",
