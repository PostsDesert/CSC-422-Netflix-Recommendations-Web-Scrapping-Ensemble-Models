        "reviewBody": "So many times, Bollywood has tried to remake Hollywood hits, only to produce total duds. Mercifully, Yash Chopra's interpretation of \"Sleeping with the Enemy\" is an extremely stylish and well-made films.\n\nShah Rukh Khan is obsessed with Juhi Chawla (who's looking her very best in here!). When he realizes that Juhi has a fiance in Sunny Deol, he stops at nothing to make sure she becomes his.\n\nEvery frame of this film is a delight to watch. Whether it's Shah Rukh chanting his trademark \"I love you, K...k...k...kiran!\" or the feel-good mushy scenes between Sunny and Juhi (who make a perfect match), you won't feel like leaving your eat in boredom.\n\nEach and every song on the soundtrack is ear pleasing, especially Jaadu Teri Nazar and Tu Mere Samne. Like I said, Juhi looks like a Goddess in this film. Darr may not be SRK's best film (that honor goes to Baazigar), but it definitely figures as one of his most flawless performances! Sunny is OK. He's done similar roles before, but he's good.\n\nOverall, Darr is g...g...g...great! ;)",
