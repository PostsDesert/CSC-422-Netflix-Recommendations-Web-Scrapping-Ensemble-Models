Clear the room and remove any distractions because you won't want to miss a second of this remarkable recounting of the Harvey Milk story. Prepare to cry and scream, because you will do both.\n\n\"The Times of Harvey Milk\" covers a bit of American history that almost NO Americans seem to know about, and this is a tragedy. Everyone should know about these events, and the astonishing, beautiful people who participated in them. Perhaps the most stunning moment to me comes when a red-haired straight woman, who became a frequent customer in Harvey Milk's camera & film-processing shop, recalls the night after Milk and Mayor Mosconi were killed. Her description, her face, and her tears make me cry every time I see it. And when Dan White was given a slap on the wrist for murdering Milk and Mayor George Mosconi... because the jurors thought he was under the influence of too many TWINKIES... the city erupted. The film of these riots is stunning, and you may find yourself wishing that you could be there with the rioters who STOOD UP to this historic injustice and demonstrated their rage. \n\nPeople of all ages and all political persuasions will find this film a remarkable document of an important bit of American history. I believe it is essential viewing for all.",
