        "reviewBody": "Iron Maiden filmed the last show with singer Bruce Dickinson (rejoined in 1999) and released it as Raising Hell. An Iron Maiden gig coupled up with horror illusions courtesy of Simon Drake. Most of the classics are there; The Trooper, The Evil That Men Do, Hallowed Be Thy Name and The Number Of The Beast. Bruce himself gets put into a real Iron Maiden at the end before Eddie takes his revenge on Simon... Horror & Heavy Metal, a killer combo! The stage is made up of various props and drapes from old tours which looks pretty good. Simons illusions are OK and add a different tilt to what would be a normal live concert video but some of his tricks are a tad lame. This is a must for every hardcore fan. It isn't as good as Maiden England but much better than Donington Live '92 as there's no slo-mo or B&W scenes. Raisng Hell is a nice memento on the 92/93 tours but not a patch on what was to come. Rock In Rio & Death On The Road. 6.5/10"
