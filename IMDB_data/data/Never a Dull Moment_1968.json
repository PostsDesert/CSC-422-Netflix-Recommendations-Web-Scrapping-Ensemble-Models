Robin Crusoe, U.S.N.\"), Dick Van Dyke went back to Disney for the third time on four years for \"Never a Dull Moment,\" with results that could best be described as mixed.\n\nNow, whenever Hollywood decides to use this all-purpose title, as it had at least four times before, beware, as the film is generally duller that usual. \"Never a Dull Moment,\" lives up to its title, thanks primarily to Van Dyke and a solid supporting cast. Edward G. Robinson, Dorothy Provine (just before her simultaneous retirement and marriage), Henry Silva, Tony Bill, Jack Elam, and Slim Pickens all do as well in their roles as the script permits.\n\nAnd there's the rub. A.J. Crothers, although the Disney people used him several times, was never one of the more inspired writers of comedy, and his films with Disney suffer for it. The cast and director Jerry Paris, a Van Dyke Show veteran on both sides of the camera, give it their best, but a limp script keeps undoing all their efforts.\n\nIn short, you, and Van Dyke, could worse than \"Never a Dull Moment,\" but you could do a whole lot better, too."
