        "reviewBody": "In the Post WWII, Police Captain Finlay (Robert Young) investigates the murder of the Jewish Joseph \"Sammy\" Samuels (Sam Levene) in his apartment after a beating with his team. Out of the blue, soldier Montgomery \"Monty\" (Robert Ryan) comes to the apartment and tells that three soldiers – Corporal Arthur \"Mitch\" Mitchell (George Cooper), soldier Floyd Bowers (Steve Brodie) and himself – had been in the apartment drinking with Sammy, and Mitch would have been the last one to leave the place. Finlay finds Mitch's wallet on the couch and he becomes the prime suspect.\n\nFinlay visits Sergeant Peter Keeley (Robert Mitchum) and he tells that his friend Mitch is a sensitive artist incapable to kill a man. Keeley decides to investigate the case to protect and clear the name of his friend. When Keeley discuss the evidences with Finlay, the captain concludes that Mitch did not have the motive to kill Sammy, who was a stranger that he met in a bar. Now Captain Finlay has another suspect and he decides to plot a scheme to expose the assassin.\n\n\"Crossfire\" is a great film-noir, with top-notch director (Edward Dmytryk) and cast with three Roberts - Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan and Robert Young; excellent story of murder and prejudice; magnificent screenplay that uses flashbacks to disclose and solve the mystery; and very impressive quotes. The theme – hatred against Jews – is unusual and this is the first time that I see a film-noir with this type of sordid story (and without the femme fatale). My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Rancor\" (\"Rancor\")",
