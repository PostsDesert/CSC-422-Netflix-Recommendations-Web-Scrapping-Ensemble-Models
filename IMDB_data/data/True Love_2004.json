Terrible writing, abhorrent acting save possibly those who did not speak, and obviously and Ed Wood style directive approach. (Cut, print, next act)\n\nThere was absolutely nothing new in these plots. It also seems to be a close-knit group of West Hollywood friends who got together and were taught their skills over brunch. My guess is they pick out some young guys and told them they were going to be in a \"Hollywood movie.\"\n\nShame. Or in Colonel Walter E. Kurtz last words, \"The horror  the horror \"",
