His job is severely tested when he has to date his best friend's girl.\n\n\"My Best Friend's Girl\" could have been a good film, but it just went all wrong. The plot is lousy and predictable, which kills off all my interest in the film. There is too much negativity and no fun in the film, making \"My Best Friend's Girl\" a chaotic mess of negative interactions. All the nastiness is disgusting instead of humorous. Kate Hudson and Dane Cook are not convincing either. And the feminist studies father is so hypocritical that he is tasteless. Seriously, the scriptwriter has very dubious taste and humour. It is a big waste of time."
