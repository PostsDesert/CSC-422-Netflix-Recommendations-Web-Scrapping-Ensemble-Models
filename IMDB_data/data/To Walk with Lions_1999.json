It'story follows 2 old men as they live in the outbacks of Africa whilst teaching a young man something (CAN'T REMEMBER). One of the men is in love with lions and the other elephants and they try to defend them from poachers. The ending is shockingly violent and tragic but overall the film is an enjoyable experience.\n\nI highly recommend this film. Such a shame Richard can't do any more films like this...\n\npeace out"
