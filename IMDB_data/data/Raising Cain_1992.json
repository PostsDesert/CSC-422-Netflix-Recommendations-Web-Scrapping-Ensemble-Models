        "name": "Muddled,derivative exercise in De Palmary with flashes of interest",
        "reviewBody": "Brian De Palma seems to generally make two kinds of films,those aimed at a mass audience {such as The Untouchables,Carrie,Carlito's Way,Mission Impossible} and those he makes to please himself and real fans {such as Femme Fatale,Blow Out,Body Double,Snake Eyes}. Dressed to Kill is somewhere in between. Raising Cain is definitely in the second category. Unfortunately,even to fans of De Palma it will probably disappoint. It has points of interest,but overall is something of a mess,in fact it has a hurried,unfinished feel to it,as if it was made in a rush.\n\nSomewhat toning down the expected sex and violence {although there is a disturbing element of child abuse},De Palma shows much of the film from the point of view of his psycho,which is interesting and allows John Lithgow full rein to have fun with his role{s}. Several times we are shown something,only for the film to double back and show that something else actually happened. This may reflect the fractured state of it's protagonist but may just be downright infuriating to some.\n\nDisappointedly,Raising Cain only has one great De Palma set piece near the end,leaving one feeling somewhat short changed for thrills. The film also has little of the visual inventiveness one expects from De Palma,in fact for much of the time it's visually dull,although at least there's a lush Pino Donnaggio score to hear. Along the way De Palma peppers the film with film homages,some of them surprising {Ghost Story,Peeping Tom,Tenebrae} and some of them from his own {Dressed to Kill,Sisters},but there's not enough originality to counter them.\n\nRaising Cain is basically a director having fun. Unfortunately,it may be difficult for viewers to join in this time."
