        "reviewBody": "Beautiful film for the art to describe the ineffable essence of an age, the subtle desire, the fear of social class, the image of religious vision like strong and necessary shell , the forms of beauty. It is exploration of a special metamorphosis in a delicate way, in kindly images, refined colors, with deep respect for atmosphere's details.\n\nA young girl in an ambiguous war with a rigid world. A father for who the rules are untouchable, hypocritical gestures of a small universe, ethics like masks of general peace, slices of ordinary existence and vagueness of desires, dreams and feelings.\n\nMary is not a victim or rebel spirit. She is only explorer of her life. Her bold gestures or words, the innocent game, the refuge beyond the family's sphere are not elements of a real fight but steps for self definition.\n\nIt is a splendid film for the science to suggest the forms of existence's assume. For the sweet colors and for gentleness of artistic expression. For the discover of emotions like seeds of everyday. For the taste of Sunday."
