        "reviewBody": "The Toy That Saved Christmas was the 6th Veggie Tales show, and it's about Buzz Saw Louie, a cool new toy, who is sold to make kids beg and whine for toys for Christmas. This particular doll feels that such a meaning to a holiday seems worthless, so he sets out to find Christmas's real meaning.\n\nThis is a childhood favorite, and my family used to watch this every December while setting up the Christmas tree or other holiday traditions.\n\nI used to always differ with my parents and sister on this and the next Christmas special- The Star of Christmas. I almost always thought Star was better, and the others preferred this. I still think that Star is better, but this is still very good in it's own right.\n\nThis Veggie Tales episode has the most famous joke in the series as well. I won't spoil it, but it involves the game Mouse Trap, and it's after the Silly Song.\n\nSpeaking of the Silly Song, it's called Oh, Santa-and it's the longest Silly Song ever written- at 5 minutes long. It's very fun and catchy- and I would actually consider it one of my favorite Christmas songs!\n\nAlso, since Veggie Tales is Christian, it's nice to hear Luke 2:8-14 in something Holiday-themed other than A Charlie Brown Christmas. That'a a great plus all on it's own!\n\nWith all of this praise, I bet you are wondering why this is a 9/10, and not a 10/10. If this were the only Veggie Tales thing ever created, this would be a 10. However, compared to an episode like Rack, Shack, and Benny(which this episode references), this lacks.\n\nEither way, on it's own, I highly recommend The Toy That Saved Christmas for holiday viewing. It's short and sweet, and a blast for the whole family. And also-hearing The Christmas Story is always nice-no matter your religious beliefs.\n\nNote: Today is 12/3/19, and I intend to write a total of 25 Christmas reviews by the 25th. I hope you enjoy the marathon! :)",
