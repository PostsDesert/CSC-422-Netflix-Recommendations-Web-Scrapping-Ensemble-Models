The plunger arrow on Lom's forehead-'Kill! Kill! Kill!', the fast and furious fight with Kato, complete with floating Hunchback of Notre Dame sequence and air-hose escape scene...oh my God....Love the laughing gas scene with Clouseau and Lom...oh that one is priceless. \n\n Lesley Anne Down as a fur coat and little else garbed Russian Spy is worth a watch too. I liked her then, I do now. \n\nEssentially you can't go wrong with this one; it's the best in the series and makes me laugh very, very hard.\n\nAnd yeah, 'Ford and Kissinger' are great too..\n\n***1/2 outta **** oh this one is a scream"
