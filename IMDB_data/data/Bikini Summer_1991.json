        "reviewBody": "Hi, Everyone, This is basically a lifeguard's view of Bosom Beach. Two girls for every buoy.\n\nThe movie is not good, but it is well photographed. Most of the actors will never work again, except maybe for drive-ins that still offer roller skate service. One exception being Carmen Santa Maria. He does very well as a musician who is trying to write a song while a naked girl keeps interrupting. Carmen's part should have been bigger and the movie might have played at some theaters that have projectors.\n\nThe movie is OK for what it is intended to be. It is one of those Save-The-Beach, Dirty-Old-Man, Naked Girl, Lying Cheater Boyfriend, Teen-Age Girl District Attorney movies that are all too common. The one mistake for which the producers cannot be forgiven is... they inserted an all girl rock band. Even for this genre, that is a low blow.\n\nNext time, less Santa Monica, more Carmen Santa Maria.\n\nTom Willett",
