        "reviewBody": "I have yet to be disappointed by anything Slayers. The series is one of my very favorites, up there with Cowboy Bebop, Dirty Pair, and the original Bubblegum Crisis. When I first saw Slayers: The Motion Picture I was a little wary due to the fact that everyone from the series was gone except for Lina, but it turned out to be a pretty fresh approach to the show.\n\nIf you liked Slayers: The Motion Picture or any of the other Lina/Naga pair-ups (Book of Spells, Great) I can see no reason why you wouldn't like this one. If you're a fan of the series but haven't yet seen any of the OVA's, I'd recommend watching The Motion Picture first just to be properly introduced to Naga, but you certainly wouldn't be too confused. There's no continuity between this and the other OVA's other than the presence of Naga, and she's not too hard to figure out.\n\nIf you're totally new to Slayers, I'd recommend checking out the original series first if possible. Still, even if you knew nothing about master sorceress Lina Inverse, I think that this disk would stand on its own fairly well.",
