        "reviewBody": "If you wonder why the inimitable Howard Hawks would state that Frances Farmer was the finest actress he ever worked with, simply take the time to watch \"Come and Get It\" and see the two totally distinct characters Frances creates in her dual performances as Lotta Morgan (mother) and Lotta Bostrom (daughter). The two women speak differently, sing differently, walk differently--they are two incredible, and individual, creations. The rest of the film unfortunately does not rise to the level of Farmer's performance(s), but it is enjoyable on its own terms in its somewhat sordid tale of a man pursuing the daughter of his long-lost true love. All of the performances are uniformly excellent, the production design is outstanding, and the second unit direction includes some thrilling logging scenes. And while Walter Brennan may have given the Academy Award winning performance from this film, it is the luminous Frances Farmer whose work here elevates her to the ranks of screen legend and who remains lodged in the memory long after the film has ended.",
