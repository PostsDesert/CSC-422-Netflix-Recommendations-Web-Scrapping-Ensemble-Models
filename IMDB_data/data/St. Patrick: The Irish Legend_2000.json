        "reviewBody": "This film essentially begins with the story of \"St. Patrick\" (Patrick Bergen) when he was a teenager living with his parents in Britain. One night he decides to witness a Druid ceremony and while participating in it a band of slave traders appear and take him to Ireland to sell on the slave market. He is then bought for 3 gold pieces and put to work tending his master's flock of sheep all by himself. It's at this time that he humbles himself before the Lord and begins to have visions which tell him of events that must transpire. After 6 years in slavery he is then guided onto a passing ship and taken back to Britain where his parents give a feast in his honor. However, their joy is broken when he tells them that he is being called upon to become a priest and join a monastery. But that's only part of his destiny. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that, although somewhat entertaining, the truth is that I found it rather disappointing. I say this because I had been hoping to see something more historically accurate than the myth and magic presented. As a matter of fact, some of the scenes were simply too preposterous and unrealistic to be believed. And it was all so unnecessary. That said I have rated this movie accordingly. Slightly below average.",
