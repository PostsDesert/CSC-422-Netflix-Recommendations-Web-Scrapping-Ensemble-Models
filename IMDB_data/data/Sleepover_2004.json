But this is not for young kids under 14. Alexa Vega is going quite well from quite kid to beautiful teenager. She is up there with Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Bynes, and Hilary Duff. This story starts out with Julie(Alexa Vega) and her friends, have a sleepover in a celebration of there last day Junior High. While there are having the time of there life. They all getting a sudden visit by the school mean girl named Staci(Sara Paxton) who presents them with a little scavenger hunt. With Staci and her gang. And thus begins a night of moments of misadventures. Enjoyable to say the least. It is basically up there with Mean Girls and New York Minute. This movie is just for pure enjoyment. But it is not still not for kids under 14."
