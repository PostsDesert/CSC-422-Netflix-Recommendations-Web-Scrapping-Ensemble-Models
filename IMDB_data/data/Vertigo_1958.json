        "reviewBody": "Two years before Hitchcock's legendary horror movie \"Psycho\" (1960) hit the theaters, our Alfred stunned audiences with another masterpiece. Perhaps not as dark, cruel and shoking as \"Psycho\" (1960) or \"The Birds\" (1963), \"Vertigo\" (1958) still manages to be called a timeless classic.\n\nFirst of all, Scottie's condition allowed the use of an entirely new camera technique. \"The Dolly Zoom\" is one of cinematography's most impressive camera tricks. Years before Steven Spielberg used it in \"Jaws\" (1975), Irmin Roberts was the first cameraman to ever use this technique, in a Hitchcock film.\n\nThis movie tells the story of Scottie, a retired cop who's asked to investigate the case of his friend's wife, which seems to be possesed by the spirit of a dead young woman who committed suicide.\n\nAs the chilling story goes on, several moments of suspense accompanied by chilling musical scores are happening. If you're not a fan of it, you can still enjoy the superb settings throughout the movie, and as well the beautifuly filmed shots. These elements alone are a pure work of art in my opinion.\n\nBecause it's a 50's film, you will encounter extravagant dialogue between the characters, that still manages to look natural. It's not over the top forced as you may see in other films of the era.\n\nToward the end of the movie, I appreciated the interesting depiction of madness that Alfred creates throughout dreams and illusions that our leading man deals with. The beautiful lighting used in the last half an hour of the movie is also outstanding enough to be mentioned. And, without spoiling anything, I'd like to mention how from my perspective, the leading man portrayed throughout the movie as a tragic hero, becomes an antagonist.\n\nDefinetly an unpredictable and stylish classic you don't want to miss.",
