        "reviewBody": "In Bucharest, Allison (Kari Wuhrer) is protecting the mysterious bible, \"The Prophet Lexicon\", where the last chapter about the apocalypse, called Revelations, discloses the name of the Antichrist in its last page. Meanwhile, the evil and jealous leader of the renegade angels Thrones, Stark (Tony Todd), forces the hit-man Dylan (Jason Scott Lee) to kill Allison to get the information about the Antichrist, but Dylan mysteriously feels attracted by the woman, protecting her against the Thrones. Allison seeks John Reigart (John Light) for help, but Satan tell her that he is interested in the apocalypse to gather millions of souls to Hell. Alone and betrayed, Allison discloses the truth about her origins, while protecting the Lexicon.\n\n\"The Prophecy: Forsaken\" is a reasonable sequel of \"The Prophecy: Upraising\", but could be better and better. The story gives a perfect sequence to \"Upraising\", but it is too brief with only 75 minutes running time. There are good ideas that are not well explored or developed, like for example the story of Allison's parents, and indeed I was quite disappointed with the weak and confused conclusion of this good series about the war of angels. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Profecia - Renegados\" (\"Prophecy - Renegades\")",
