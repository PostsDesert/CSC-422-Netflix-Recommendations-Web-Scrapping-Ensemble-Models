What he didn't realize is that the check was meant for gangsters and soon they're coming after him.\n\nBLANK CHECK is a decent kids movie that has an obvious set-up and then turns into yet another clone of HOME ALONE. If you're a kid then you can easily connect to the lead in this film and I'm sure young minds will have fun with the idea of getting a blank check and getting to have fun with it buying whatever you want.\n\nThe story is a pretty easy set-up and for the most part the film has enough laughs and adventure to where I'm sure kids will enjoy it. As far as the adults watching, there's nothing awful about the picture but there's no question that it lacks any real imagination and the HOME ALONE clone just doesn't have many laughs going for it.\n\nBLANK CHECK is a decent kids film that younger people should enjoy but the adults might be looking at their watches a few times."
