And, being as bad ( and laughable ) as it was, it has become a cult classic as a result. I mention that by way of comparison. \"Reefer Madness\" falls into the same category, even though the production of it was somewhat better, with an added bonus for the folks involved with the making of it ...It was also meant to be used as a \"teaching\" tool. Teaching in this instance being synonymous with propaganda. Calling this flick \"highly exaggerated\" or \"over the top\" is putting it mildly. Which is exactly why, given the very pronounced change in society's view of marijuana, it is so much fun and rightly deserves the title \"Cult Classic\". Well done? Hardly. Fun? Oh yes. So ... I think everyone ought to see this at least once just for the fun of it. Parents, tell your children.",
