There are at least two good reasons...\n\nFirst, if you were a teenager in the early 1960s, like I was, and looked forward to watching American Bandstand, this weekly TV series is a marvelous, nostalgic reminder of those times. Whether your memories were good or bad, this is the closest we will ever get to \"being there\" one more time. The film clips from the original Bandstand show add to the realism.\n\nSecond, if you are too young to remember the 1960s, and are curious, the styles of dress, the dialog, the boy-girl infatuations, the racial tension, the religious conflicts over birth control, the \"transistor radios\" that everyone carried around, the round-screen black and white TVs, all those are very authentic in this TV series.\n\n\"American Dreams\" - overall a very fine show, one we've dreamed about for years!"
