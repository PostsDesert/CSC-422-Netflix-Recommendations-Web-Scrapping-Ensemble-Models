A man revenging the death of his 7-year old son, but he has to get himself into prison where the dudes are that caused this trauma. Along the way no spectaculare things happen, because the most parts are already told in 100 other movies. Don't be throwing it directly to the bin, cause the character of Michael is played more then reasonable. No real good conversations, but some nice action scenes. Finishing in a \"never-thought-it-could-be-in-this-kind-of-movie\" end...but maybe one of the better ends I've seen in this genre.",
