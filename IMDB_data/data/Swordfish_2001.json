        "reviewBody": "I'm a fan of Hugh Jackman's, so I looked forward to seeing \"Swordfish,\" which also stars another actor I like, John Travolta. The film was not produced with an eye to my demographic, so I did not like it as much as some people may have.\n\nTravolta plays this incredibly ruthless man, someone committed to keeping the country safe from terrorists, who offers a hacker with child custody issues (Jackman) a chance to make a fortune, enabling him to hire a top attorney and get custody of his daughter. He needs the code cracked to a bank and account holding $9 billion in government money, and the money disseminated to various accounts.\n\nThe beginning of the film is fascinating - it's Travolta discussing the film Dog Day Afternoon - but alas, it's downhill from there. I'm normally not the most technically observant person when I'm watching a movie, but even I could tell that computerized images and miniatures did a lot of the work.\n\nHallie Berry gets to show off most of her beautiful body and there's plenty of action. Young men, I'm sure, love this film. Unfortunately I'm not a young man. And after seeing \"Swordfish,\" I was 1 hour and 39 minutes older.",
