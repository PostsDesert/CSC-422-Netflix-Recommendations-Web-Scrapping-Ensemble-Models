        "reviewBody": "Although Trading Places is a much better film, the second collaboration between John Landis and Eddie Murphy is up there. Coming To America is an easy movie to like and while I met some younger people that have not seen it, I have yet to meet anyone that has seen Coming To America that didn't like it. It blends outrageous comedy, and romance and John Landis balances this all out by making this a good movie to boot with characters and story audiences can care about. It would be easy for this to get too over the top, but never does. Coming To America is very funny, but it is a romantic comedy as well, but does not get too sentimental to where it gets in the way of the comedy. Eddie's sidekick Arsenio Hall has great comedic chemistry with Eddie and is very funny in this film. I think Coming To America easily holds up and does what it does well enough to warrant a sequel after all these years that I can't wait to check out. The support cast did well too, I especially enjoyed both dads,James Earl Jones and John Amos who both starred in two of my favorite barbarian movies that came out the same year. In closing Coming To America is great entertainment with quotable dialogue and is one of the more memorable comedy blockbusters that came out in my youthful days.",
