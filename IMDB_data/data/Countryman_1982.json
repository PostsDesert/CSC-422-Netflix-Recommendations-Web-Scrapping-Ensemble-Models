        "reviewBody": "A plane crashes deep in the heart of a Caribbean island. A local fisherman, Countryman, rescues the man and woman, but soon finds they are being hunted by the army. This film could have been the template for the second half of Crocodile Dundee 2 - a journey through a wild land, a hero who respects the land and its mystical aspects, and villains who come a cropper in their disrespect for nature. The film has a certain charm, walking a fine line between the innocence of the hero, and the worldly events that impinge on his way of life. The soundtrack is amazing, some early versions of classic Bob Marley (Small Axe) and Toots & the Maytals (Bam Bam) - and many other great reggae tunes.\n\nOverall, an enjoyable, eco-friendly film with killer music.",
