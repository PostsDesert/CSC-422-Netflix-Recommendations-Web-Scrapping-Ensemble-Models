Most talented actors, really cleverly made script and all, and also containing many words and phrases that got into lexicon. Nikulin as always geniusely acts both the facial expressions in the song \"Postoy Porovoz\", and the ones in other scenes (like the fight with Shurik). I could say that the song alone is enough to watch it, even for those who did not directly experience that kind of life, it would still cause a sense of cheerful nostalgy. Morgunov - also one of the most talented and known soviet actors, for those who ever liked him - it is most definitely one of his best pictures. Few more can be said, I mean - just watch it."
