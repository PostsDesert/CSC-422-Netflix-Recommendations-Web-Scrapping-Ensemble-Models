        "reviewBody": "Be careful what you wish for; it just might come true. And in this movie it all does. A wonderfully entertaining movie and not just for kids. I first saw this movie when I was 18 and have loved it ever since. Not just a story about what it's like to wish you were someone else and find that once it comes true it's not all it's cracked up to be. It's also a tale about two sisters who learn not just about themselves but also about each other. For anyone who has a sibling they feel they can't relate to, this movie is a wonderful chance to see that it doesn't necessarily have to be that way. And while there are moments in the film where it seems hard to remember who's in which body or you realize that that person is not necessarily the one who needed to learn that particular lesson, the film's overall message is touching enough and so masterfully delivered that it hardly matters. And though the twist ending may not be a surprise to all, it still gets me every time. Katherine Heigl and Danielle Harris shine like stars. I just wish everyone enjoys the film as much as I did.",
