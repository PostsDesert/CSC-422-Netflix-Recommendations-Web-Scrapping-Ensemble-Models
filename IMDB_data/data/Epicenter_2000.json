Lousy effects, lousy story, lots of continuity errors, terrible dialogs. As for the acting.... well, perhaps Traci Lords should have stuck to her old trade. Then again, she's one of the best actors in this movie, so there you go. So, why did I keep watching until the end? Well, this one is so bad that it's actually fun to keep watching! So, in fact, to be honest, if you want to have a good time, invite some friends, have a couple of stiff drinks and then watch this movie. You'll be on the floor laughing.",
