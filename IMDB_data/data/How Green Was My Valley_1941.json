        "reviewBody": "This movie is a little long at times, but this is still a powerful story about the many stories that came out of the coal mining families in Wales, Great Britain. One of the top aspects of the movie is the cinematography, under the direction of John Ford. It is very effective. You can just feel the grime and dirt of the mines and cobblestone town. It looks really good now that's it out on DVD.\n\nWalter Pigeon is the likable minister, and lead character, \"Mr. Gruffydd.\" He's likable because he doesn't judge people as the head deacon does. The latter is portrayed ludicrously by Barry Fitzgerald, much to the delight of secular-minded film critics, who loved his performance. Nonetheless, there is a lot of \"religion\" pictured positively in this film, a lot of spiritual scenes and most were done well.\n\nRoddy McDowell plays the most memorable character, I thought: \"Huw,\" a young boy who went through some really tough times, as did most of the townsfolk. \n\nIf you are used to modern films, be warned this film does drag in spots. It is a fine movie, to be sure, and a powerful and emotional story.",
