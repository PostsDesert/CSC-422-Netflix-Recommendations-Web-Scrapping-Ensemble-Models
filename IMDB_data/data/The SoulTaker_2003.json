        "reviewBody": "Although this may be a short show this is far out the best i've come across. This show at points may be confusing, so note of warning if you plan on seeing this show watch from first episode not half way through as i did. the manner of which the show is presented is brilliant. Although i must warn this show is not for every one it does at points contain graphic animated violence but still a brilliant show. I myself love this show and recommend this show for those who are a fan of animated violence and hand to hand combat.\n\nThe characters Kyoske Date and Shiro Kirihara are for me the most interesting and you will find out why when you watch this show every one has a secret agenda even the flickers but to find all these out i say go to the video store and rent all 4 volumes you will not be disappointed i know i wasn't when i saw them.\n\nThe show it's self is explosive great beginning and a ground breaking ending from the drawing to the music it is all brilliant and personally i love the them song even though it's an Japanese. So for me i would rate this show well 10/10 and i'm not being modest it really is brilliant."
