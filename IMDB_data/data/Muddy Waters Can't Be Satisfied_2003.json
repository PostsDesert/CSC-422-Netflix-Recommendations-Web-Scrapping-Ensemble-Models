Did Muddy ever get any type of training on the guitar? c. Did Muddy's innovation of big blues sound catch on right away?\n\n-I am a man who studies feminist theory and am very appreciative of some of feminist history. I don't make it a habit of pointing out what films are sexist, and I definitely would not say that this particular film was. However, while watching \"Muddy Waters: can't be satisfied\" I heard someone mention a term that struck me as peculiar.\n\n\"He was a 'womanizer',\" they said. For this to be true, one should evaluate the meaning of the word, why it is used, and how it is used. \"Sterilize\" references a process of becoming sterile. Does the term \"womanize\" refer to a process of becoming a woman?\n\n-The music is terrific. \n\n-Keith Richards must have always been under the influence. \n\n-The outtakes are actually somewhat worthwhile.",
