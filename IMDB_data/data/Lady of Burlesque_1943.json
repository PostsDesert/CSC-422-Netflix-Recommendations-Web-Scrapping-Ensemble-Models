If I recall correctly, the book was amusing but\n\nthin and the movie is a considerable improvement on it.\n\nAlso, if I recall correctly, Gypsy was an \"intellectual\" stripper who\n\nshowed a minimum of skin and so the movie was not inaccurate\n\nin that respect.\n\nStanwyck showed, not only versatility, but a considerable amount\n\nof warmth in the part of Dixie, qualities which the original Gypsy\n\nalso had. (I had a friend, now deceased, who worked with Gypsy\n\nfor a time and he spoke about her a great deal and with much\n\nadmiration.)\n\nI thought Michael O'Shea was excellent as the comic Biff and Pinky\n\nLee fit into the backstage ambiance beautifully. The \"mystery\" was\n\nof almost no interest but this is besides the point. The\n\nphotography was also very interesting and added to the sleazy\n\nbackstage atmosphere.",
