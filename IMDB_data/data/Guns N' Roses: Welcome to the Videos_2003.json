Some of the videos are very good - \"November Rain\" won the award for Best Cinematography in a music video, \"Sweet Child\" is great and \"Yesterdays\" feels very nostalgic as you can tell from the lyrics and style that the band knew they were about to break apart and it was a sort of final farewell.\n\nAll in all this is a must-buy and my only wish is that the DVD would have contained commentaries.",
