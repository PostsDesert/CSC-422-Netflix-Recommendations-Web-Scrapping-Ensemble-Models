Vince was much better, more thorough, full, than what I've seen him in before (which isn't much) and now I'll expect more. Judd, Davies, and Rudd are also fairly unfamiliar, but now I'll get at them too. They were all fine, but I want that second viewing. I'll probably tape it, but it only came on once this month here. Maybe I'll rent it. Certainly not upbeat, but so is life sometimes. The actors had me reacting with both anger and tenderness, so I hope that won't be lost next time. \n\n As for other mentioned films, Cat left me cool, Hud I love, and remaking Streetcar sans Leigh, Brando, Hunter, et al, is fruitless, even with full dialogue. \n\nI'm much more on the positive side with this one so far...hope it lasts..."
