        "reviewBody": "First of all, it is Bollywood! So stop looking for signs of a Spielberg flick!! True, the plot is a Bollywood clich√©; rich girl, poor boy, angry parents, etc. But keep in mind that the story line wasn't so tired and typical when this movie was first released and helped lead to a decade of romance-driven Bollywood movies. Khan portrays a solid character who has both comical and dramatic moments beautifully acted by him. And Madhuri, who won a best actress award for this role, delivers a great performance. The soundtrack is very good, thanks to the exceptional voice of Udit Narayan whose smile you can \"hear\" through the music. I gave this movie 5 starts instead of 4 because I have such fond memories of watching it when it came out in 1990. But compared to other Bollywood movies, it should really be a 4.",
