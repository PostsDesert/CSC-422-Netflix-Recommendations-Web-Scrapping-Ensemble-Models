BUT ending was too abrupt and left many questions unanswered\n\nThe main cast was all pretty good at acting, and Cha Eun Woo's visuals were top notch as usual - the cameo by Astro was really great as well!\n\nThe issue I had with this drama, however, was that the ending came too abruptly and a lot of issues could have been further resolved before they ended the series. It was, to say the least, unsatisfying, and I didn't even realize it had ended until I kept searching for the next episode but couldn't find one.\n\nOverall, though, this was a really cute drama and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a short, fun series!",
