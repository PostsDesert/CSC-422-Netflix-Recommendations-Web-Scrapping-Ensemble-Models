Admittedly, it does have its flaws, and it's no Sleeping Beauty, but then again, what is?\n\nI think many people don't give this and similar movies a chance because they're not Disney. But heck, Pocahontas was by Disney, and it sucked! So, don't judge a movie by its studio. You really should give this movie a try."
