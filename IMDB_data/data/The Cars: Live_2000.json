Haven't heard them in so long, it was great to see just how good they really were. I enjoyed the interview that was included on the DVD,in which the viewer had the last chance to see Benjamin Orr before he died a few months after the interview. He looked awful (pancreatic cancer), but it was good to hear what he had to say. If you are a Cars fan, then you need to watch this!",
