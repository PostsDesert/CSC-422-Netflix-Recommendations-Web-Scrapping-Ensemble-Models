        "reviewBody": "I rented this movie basically because of its cover. It looked kind of spooky and dark and that is just what I expected; a dark and mysterious thriller. What I got was a family film, more in the vein of \"Scooby Doo\" and \"Spy Kids\". \n\nIt is basically about a family solving mysterious situations at a high school where the local law enforcers fail. The kids go undercover as students (duh, didn't see that one coming) and get right sucked into a rivalry between the popular football team, aka bullies, and the outcasts of the school. Not too original. \n\nThe acting is not mindblowing, but neither is it in any way annoying. The grand finale in the end where the mystery is revealed is kind of a letdown and if you spotted the clues during the film (you have great pointers by the way) you will see it coming a mile away. \n\nThis movie is a kids movie, but is PG-13 rated, which makes it fall between the chair of the kid audience and the sophisticated older watchers. The cover and the rating made me think of something more like \"Wire in the Blood\", but in the end, this movie is too much Spy Kids. Avoid if you are allowed to watch."
