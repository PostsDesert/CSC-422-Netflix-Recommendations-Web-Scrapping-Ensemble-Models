I'm a little disappointed. This is only a formulae thriller, perhaps just a cut above average, with decent casting and direction. I can see the Craig Brewer touch in the screenplay: relatively interesting characters, mostly believable plot considering the contrivances necessary for a formulae thriller, and good dialogue. I will still keep an eye on this remarkable talent for another unforgettable picture like his first. Some day. In the meantime I know you gotta pay the rent.",
