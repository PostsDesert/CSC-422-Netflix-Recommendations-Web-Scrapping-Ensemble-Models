        "reviewBody": "I've always gotten a kick out of Wallace's inventions to this collection of 10 two-minute \"shorts\" was great fun for me. Each one is about a different invention. Most of them, if not all, had flaws but they also worked pretty darn well, too. Regardless, all of them were fun. I laughed at things I saw in all 10 of them.\n\nNot only was the humor outstanding but the DVD picture was great, too, and I used the subtitles to further enjoy listening to the many British expressions our Mad Inventor uses. I just loved everything about this.\n\nApparently, many of these little stories were made before these two animated characters became famous, first in Britain and now worldwide. \n\nI wouldn't know where the start in picking out my favorites but the first one, with Gromit showing his goaltender skills, was tough to beat. In all of these, Wallace's comments and Gromit's expressions are priceless.\n\nIf you own the \"Wallace & Gromit Three Major Adventures\" DVD, don't pass up these bonus feature.",
