        "reviewBody": "Going by the title, one might reasonably assume Summer Camp Nightmare to be another late '80s slasher movie, but there are no masked machete-wielding maniacs on this occasion. Instead, we have a Lord of the Flies-inspired storyline in which the teenagers at Camp North Pines rebel against authority, taking the counselors prisoner. Led by the charismatic but psychotic Franklin (Charlie Stratton), the kids party and go wild, but the revolution ultimately leads to rape, revenge and murder.\n\nSummer Camp Nightmare isn't a terrible movie, but it is terribly dated, suffering from a big dose of '80s cheeze: the music and fashion is hilarious, particularly during the camp talent show, with the only black character performing a rap (more John Barnes than Ice-T), three teen bimbos giving Bananarama a run for their money in the lack of talent stakes, and a couple of rebellious types performing an atrocious hair metal song. There's also the obligatory nerd, Donald Poultry (Adam Carl), who is a computer whizz, carrying around a box of high-tech tricks that save the day. With less of the tacky high jinx, and more grittiness and hard-edged realism, Summer Camp Nightmare could have been something special; as it stands, it is a rather inconsequential and forgettable flick.\n\n5/10. A missed opportunity.",
