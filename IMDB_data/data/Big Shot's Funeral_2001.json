        "reviewBody": "Puzzled?\n\nDo you like to be puzzled? Do you like movies having a surprise ending?\n\nThen it is a must to watch \" Big Shot's Funeral\" - a film about the difficult matter of making films. Sounds serious- but it isn't, in fact it is pretty funny.\n\nFilm within a Film\n\nA documentary cameraman Yo-Yo(Ge You)is hired to document the way a fabulously successful director Don Tyler (Donald Sutherland) is remaking Bertulucci's movie \"The Last Emperor\". During the process of work the director feels more and more uninspired, if not disillusioned.\n\nWhen understanding comes without Language\n\nLucy (Rosamund Kwan), his personal assistant tries hard to keep him going, but in a strange way Yo-Yo having no command of English touches him and arouses his interest. Due to a misunderstanding ( Lucy is trying to mediate between the two men) Tyler catches the idea that in China even a funeral is a comical event and asks Yo-Yo to arrange something like that for him just in case of his death.\n\nTo Be or Not to Be\n\nWhen the director goes into coma, Yo-Yo starts immediately to arrange the whole thing. He approaches King ( Ying Da), a blond Chinese concert promoter, to make up the event as a gigantic media spectacle. How to finance such a comedy funeral? No big deal - product placement will help. When all space is sold - Tyler recovers, which clearly means that Yo-Yo is in big trouble and the film has to come to an end. The puzzle is solved in a surprising way - go and find out yourself.\n\nAs You Like It\n\nFor sure you won't regret going to the movies although you will not learn so much about China or Chinese culture and life styles. This film turns out to be a satire on media, commercialism and \"Big Shots\". And for all those who don't want to do without love - you do not have to.\n\n Written by: Eva Behrendt, Dorothea Maurer, Martina Koepp, Karin Schmidt-\n\nparticipants of the Berlinale- film - workshop \"At the Movies\",2002"
