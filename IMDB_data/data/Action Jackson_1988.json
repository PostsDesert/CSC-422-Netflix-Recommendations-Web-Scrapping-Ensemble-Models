The only guns Carl Weathers needs to fight crime are his rippling biceps. Throw in the wickedly evil Craig T. Nelson and a couple of foxy supporting ladies, and baby you got a stew going (couldn't help the Arrested Development reference). \n\nThis has all of the tropes of the period, plus a healthy dose of blaxploitation; and it's a potent mixture. Not to mention the wide range of stunts. Let me put it another way; a bad guy is thrown out of the window of one building ... and through the window of another one! It's loud, over-the-top and wildly entertaining.",
