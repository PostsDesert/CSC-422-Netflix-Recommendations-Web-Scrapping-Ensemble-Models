I thought it was your usual silly alien film - but it is so much more then that - and if it is possible the brilliant Ron Howard makes it all believable. Two things stand out among all else - the fantastic score (one of the best I have ever heard) The superb ending - which was one of the most original endings - possibly ever.\n\nI just can't say enough about just how good this film is.\n\nAs far as performances go I was particularly surprised by the acting of the senior citizens especially Jack Gilford as the miserable old codger Bernie - I love it when he completely breaks down and softens after spending an hour and 20 minutes as the most awful old man you could ever have the misfortune to bump into - the transformation was immediate but so believable - and I personally think that performance was worthy of a supporting actor oscar.\n\nAlso Brian Dennehy, Wilford Brimley, Don Ameche and Steve Guttenburg were also excellent.\n\nAn all round fantastic film which everyone can enjoy - all ages"
