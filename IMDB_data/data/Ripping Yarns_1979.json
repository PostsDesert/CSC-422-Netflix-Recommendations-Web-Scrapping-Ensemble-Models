The Officers Mess dining room scene in 'Roger of the Raj' is indescribably funny (if you're British) and the ghastly traditions of 'Tomkinson Schooldays' brings back so many unfond memories. As for Eric Oldthawite - I had to work with him for three years. He drove me to the edge of suicide he was so boring. You have to be a British dimwitted upper class twit to find them funny. Oh, the irony....",
