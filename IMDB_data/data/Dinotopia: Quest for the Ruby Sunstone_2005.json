Seems to me, that's what the other reviewers were.\n\nHowever, my 3-year old son, who happens to be a dinosaur fanatic, LOVES this movie. He's too young to be able to watch the mini-series or read the books. However, this was a great way to get him introduced to the Dinotopia world at his early age. No violence, no risqu√© dialogue, just wholesome child-friendly dinosaur fun. Why look for inconsistencies in a kid's movie? So it's not like the books - most kid's movies aren't.\n\nMy son has every word of this movie memorized - subsequently, so do I. If you have young children, especially those that like dinosaurs, this movie is perfect.",
