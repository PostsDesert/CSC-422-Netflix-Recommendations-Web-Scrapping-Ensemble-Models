Billy looks really cute on this video, too, and he sure can dance... ;) I think it's really creative how he decided to play Christie Brinkley's mechanic, and the dance scheme is awesome! I mean, who would've thought of that for a music video? And the setting is picture perfect, the perfect ambiance for the 80's. It's similar to the setting of the courtroom in the Keeping the Faith video, which is another great video! \"Y'know, judge, they say that justice is blind, but I sure hope it ain't def!\" Lol, you gotta love that line! Okay, I'm drifting from the subject... :P So, what do you guys think of Uptown Girl? What other videos of Billy do you like?"
