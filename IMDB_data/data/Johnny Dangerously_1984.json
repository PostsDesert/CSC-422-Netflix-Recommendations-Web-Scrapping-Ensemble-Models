        "reviewBody": "Michael Keaton had the job of not only portraying the fictional gangster Johnny Dangerously, but he had to play the role by giving his best James Cagney impression. From the Irish smile, the walk and the way he hung his gangster type hat on his head, Keaton captured the Rocky Sullivan character from the 1940's. Like Keaton's character, many of the sets the movie was shot on were taken right out of movies like Little Caesar and Public Enemy. The Club Scene is right out of Little Caesar as well as the exterior of the hotel and the downtown newspaper stands. The Mafia's office room is straight out of Little Caesar as well. An amazingly funny cast including Danny DeVito, you can't beat this comedy. A well done story with non stop comic relief with great production value and acting.",
