I couldn't understand why I was so , so, afraid of him even in films like \"Velvet Goldmine\" He is a poster boy for putrid souls in elegant wrapping. In \"American Psycho\" - a film that deserves much more attention than it's got - he is absolutely terrific. Totally believable. I could sense his delight in playing a monster of this kind. Interestingly enough this manicured monster seems to be asking for sympathy, imagine the nerve! But Christian Bale succeeds in showing us a face we (I) hadn't quite seen before and yet we (I) accept without question. He should have gotten an Oscar nomination but, fortunately, he didn't.",
