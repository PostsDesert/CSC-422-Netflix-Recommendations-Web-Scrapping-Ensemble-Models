        "reviewBody": "I saw the Boy With Green Hair a long time ago and it stayed with me. It was hard to imagine all that fuss even back in the 1960'3 over one poor kid who's hair just happened to turn green. But, like others have mentioned consider the times and the era. World war Two had just ended and the Cold War had just begun. I can still remember people picking on\"long hairs\" in the early sixties because they let their hair grow a bit. This is a very memorable, stay with you classic about tolerance of different people, especially those with no choices in the matter. It is worth watching and renting and possibly buying. Too many movie critics on these pages and with older movies try to applies today norms and political correctness to decades old movies when the norm was different then. The movie is an excellently acted parable. I am surprised it hasn't been released on vhs or dvd or just plain shown more often on some of the cable movie channels. Unlike today, no kid back, especially a boy would have dyed their hair green. It may be a movie from a different era but the message is still the same regardless of the times. It may be dated a little, but it is still a classic."
