From Dublin to Galway, the movie mentioned most often was \"The Field.\" Controversial and yet considered to be one of the truest representations of the Irish people of that era. It's also one of the few stories told about those who stayed behind during the famine, and survived. If you're looking for a feel-good movie about leprechauns, this ain't it. If you're up for \"Gangs of New York\" or \"Legends of the Fall,\" you can handle it. Incredible performances by the late, Great Richard Harris and Sean Bean."
