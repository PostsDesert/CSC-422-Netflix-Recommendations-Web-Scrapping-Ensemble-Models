While his fame somewhat declined in the 1990s, anyone born before then was treated to a treasure chest of positive reenforcement learning experiences. Younger generations who have been numbed with their Pokemon, cable TV and Playstations may find him boring and inaccessible, but the millions of kids that did grow up with Mr. Rogers will surely the kindness and greatness that was in his heart.\n\nNo one to this day has ever managed to say a bad thing about Mr. Rogers. Not even Rotten.com, a consortium of all that is evil in the world, could find something sarcastic to say about this man. When the world ends and all we have left are tapes of television shows, I certainly hope this film and a majority of Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood is among those tapes. I couldn't think of a better answer to help illustrate the compassion, tolerance and love our culture could have.",
