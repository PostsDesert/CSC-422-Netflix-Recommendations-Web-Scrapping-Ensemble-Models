        "reviewBody": "We start with two women bored with their inattentive husbands, and on vacation/business. When those two women are Kim Yates and Amy Lindsay, this type of Skinemax fare should earn your interest.\n\nAs the husbands attend a conference, the women are sent off to an Old West town, and the place is pretty deserted. While exploring the saloon, they touch a mirror which pulls them in and transports them to 1888. We'd just watched the pilot for Outlaws, where five men are struck by lightning and transported from 1899 to 1986, so this seemed the perfect followup.\n\nWhat follows are scenes between two character who have nothing to do with the story ... a young man and a supposed Indian maiden ... no longer a maiden after their two scenes. A scene with the sheriff, who looks just like Amy Lindsay's husband, Amy and a saloon customer ... as they've been mistaken for newly arriving saloon girls ... Kim and a preacher who looks like HER husband.\n\nWith the looks of the women in this movie, all the simulated sex scenes work.",
