The acting is wonderful and worth watching several times, especially the character of Pauline and how she interacts with all the other characters of the film. Watch her eyes. An amazing portrayal. While the plot may seem simplistic to some viewers, it is not without its own form of dramatic tension and compelling comedy. The colors of the sets are interesting in conjunction with the character development. The music chosen for each scene is interesting and idiosyncratic. I was reminded of the Norwegian film \"Elling,\" as well as some elements of the Canadian film \"Strangers in Good Company.\" All these films have a real breath of fresh air that is palpable.",
