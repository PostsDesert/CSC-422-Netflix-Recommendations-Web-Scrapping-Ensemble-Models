However, compared with the usual liberties translators took with anime series, the scripts remained mostly faithful to the originals.\n\nAnd it allowed me the chance to seeing by the first time many wonderful classics such as \"The Snow Queen\", \"The Twelve Months\", \"The Scarlet Flower\", and many others.\n\nThat is enough for me to have a high appreciation for this series. It was a marvellous treasure, especially in a time were accessibility to these gems were much difficult than nowadays.",
