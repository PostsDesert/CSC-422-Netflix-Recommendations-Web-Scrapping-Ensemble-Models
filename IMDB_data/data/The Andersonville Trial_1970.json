Basehart, Shatner, Cassidy, Salmi, and Mitchell all give excellent performances. It is also a highly intelligent film, dealing with complex issues of military morality. indeed, it is puzzling that this fine film has never been rerun..then again, most of the great Television dramas are never rerun. Perhaps a new cable network could be created..call it \"QTV' for \"quality Television', devoted to shows like The Defenders, Naked City, Slatterys People,The Westerner,My World ( And Welcome to It), Nichols and to the great dramas of the golden age, such as this. Of course, thats yet another impossible dream"
