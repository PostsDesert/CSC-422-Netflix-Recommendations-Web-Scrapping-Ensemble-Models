        "reviewBody": "The movie's not as bad as Maltin's Movie Guide claims, giving it only a star-and-half out of four. But the production does squander a novel concept. The idea of a family living in a modular house underwater is inventive. Trouble is the constant underwater fish frolics along with a number of tacked-on subplots distract from what there is of human hijinks. It's like the producers were fascinated with the trained dolphins, seals, etc. They're cute, but enough is enough.\n\nAs a result, genuine comedic talents like Backus and Randall are largely wasted, while the 60's rock band is catchy but their lingo is so 'like yesterday'. In fact, the many disparate parts are not well blended making for awkward passages, like the subplot with Bruce Gordon and the naval war ships that more or less just dangle.\n\nToo bad, because the special effects are well done, along with an attractive cast. Plus, the results are attractively photographed in eye-catching Technicolor. Then too, actress Ray, in a supporting role, almost steals the show with her comical shenanigans. At the same time, I hope the many marine critters and their trainers got bonuses for their overtime work.\n\nAll and all, the 90-minutes remains a well-meaning concoction. Nonetheless, it looks to me like the producers were pretty much stuck about where to go with their novel premise-- so they struck out in too many poorly combined directions. No wonder the promising premise has slipped into genuine obscurity."
