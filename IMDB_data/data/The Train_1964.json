        "reviewBody": "The big star of Frankenheimer's film is the train itself... And the plot is based on the characteristic of railroadsengines and cars all over the tracks, cabs and steamall shown on enough detail to keep the viewer in great suspense The aerial strike shots are also wonderfully taken \n\nThe film begins in Paris, August 2, 1944 \n\nIt's 1511th day of German occupation The liberation of Paris seems very close \n\nNazi Colonel Von Waldheim (Paul Scofield) decides suddenly to remove by train to Germany the best of Impressionist masterpieces His objective is clear: \"Money is a weapon. The contents are as negotiable as gold and more valuable.\" \n\nMademoiselle Villard (Suzanne Flon) informs the Resistance of the shipmentThe Resistance reaction is to stop the train without damaging the national heritage \"They are part of France.\" But stopping the train is not a simple task You can get killed especially if you are French and the train is German \n\nLabiche (Burt Lancaster), the Chief Inspector of the French Railway System, is not impressed However, he never communicates his political, ideological, or nationalistic convictions, \"For certain things, we take the risk,\" he said; \"but I won't waste lives on paintings.\" \n\nWhen an aged engineer, Papa Boule (Michel Simon), is accused of sabotage in spite of saving the train through the Allied's bombs at the risk of his own life, Labiche is forced into combat \n\nIt begins with a long sequence where an armament train and the art train are both trying to leave the yard in the morning As they are being moved back and forth across the tracks, the viewer knows that British planes will hit the yard in that moment at exactly 10:00 o'clock \n\nNew complications are introduced, but the central conflict always returns to an obsessive art lover against a man with no appreciation for art Labiche's only concerns is to slow down the Nazis keeping himself and his compatriots alive \n\nNow, two forces control the film The first is Frankenheimer's cleverness to choreograph the real trains Frankenheimer and his cinematographers capture the heat of the engines, the noise and sound of the cars in motion, the fault in the oil line, the crushing strength implicated when the machines come into collision and the derailment The second force is Lancaster, the \"headache\" of the fanatical obsessed Colonel whose desire is to see the priceless paintings in Nazi Germany...",
