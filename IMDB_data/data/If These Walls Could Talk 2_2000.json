        "reviewBody": "I saw this film on the recommendation of a friend. In fact her recommendation was so good, I got the film from Amazon before I'd even seen it and as usual she was so right! The first part is moving, brilliantly acted and very, very sad. You will need tissues for this one. It may also anger you, as it did me! The treatment the old lady receives from the nephew is just appalling.\n\nThe second part is less sad. I was still moved by it and sad at times but overall it's very good. The sex scenes throughout this movie are very tasteful in my opinion. Very watchable.\n\nThe third and final part is my favourite. Ellen is such a funny and amazing actress and Sharon Stone is excellent, also. The topic discussed here is very moving, but very well dealt with. The sex scenes are sexy and yet tasteful. They are in no way pornographic as I have heard people say. The story is one that many lesbians can relate to, or maybe will relate to in the future (my self included, hopefully) and the ending makes me cry every time! My only negative point is that it wasn't longer! A full movie about this topic with these characters would be a must-see in my opinion! Perhaps someone should write one?\n\nI think the film would be enjoyable to anyone, not just lesbians and it is well worth a look. Enjoy Charlene",
