She keeps having flashbacks about a past suicide attempt and her boyfriend (Chris Sarandon) is in total disbelief.\n\nAs far as shock value is concerned this film is a total success. It features some of the strangest, most disturbing images in movie history and that ending is really something. However, it is extremely dull and uneven for most of the films running time. Still, it has a GREAT cast.\n\nRated R; Nudity, Graphic Violence, Sexual Situations, and Profanity."
