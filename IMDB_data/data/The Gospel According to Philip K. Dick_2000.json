        "reviewBody": "As a certifiable \"Dick-head,\" I bought this docu in the hopes it might shed some additional light on one of the greatest purveyors of sci-fi and American literature in general. Dick was a brilliant -- a superlative I seldom use -- man. His stories were fascinating meditations on what constitutes reality, self, etc. Sadly, this docu is a cheapo featuring some nice interviews with Dick friends and fans (could have done without the fans, who while sincere didn't seem that knowledgeable or at the very least interesting).\n\nMost distracting -- and reeking of padding -- are the \"animated\" segments. Truly awful. I assume they were done in Flash, but they are static beyond belief. I speed-scanned through them all.\n\nDick deserves a fine documentary. This isn't it. Read Lawrence Sutin's bio if you seek info on Dick. Or read Paul Williams' interviews with the man. Skip this sorry effort.",
