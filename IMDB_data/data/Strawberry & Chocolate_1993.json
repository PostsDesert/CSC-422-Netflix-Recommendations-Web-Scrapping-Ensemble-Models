See what I'm getting at? Writer Producer Director tells you it makes sense because it all takes place in the brain and the brain is ever-changing and ever-weird -- so deal with it. Nope!!!!! Sorry, it doesn't work like that -- you still need a story. Can't throw a bunch of weird hi$ in there and call it an avant garde film. It gets a 5 because I appreciate the weird and strange but the whole film stinks of a college / Film school project. As a side note the human sized talking mice stole the show for me.",
