        "reviewBody": "A lot of old newsreels were combed to make this nostalgic short subject from 1956. It got an Oscar nomination for Best Short Subject. \n\nA whole lot of political and other kind of celebrities from the 20s who many even in 1956 and more so now are forgotten are recalled in this compilation. With the exception of George Bernard Shaw and Alfred E. Smith they are all recalled with no voices.\n\nThe only left alive from the film was a baby who was pictured with her mother and grandmother. Ms. Elizabeth Windsor was carried by her mother who was Elizabeth Bowes-Lyons the Dutchess of York. They're both pictured with Queen Mary of Great Britain. All as we know became Queen of Great Britain with the babe now 91 years old and still reigning as same.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw gave us some of his Shavian wit, but the one best shown is Governor Alfred E. Smith of New York who was Democratic candidate for president in 1928. During his growing up on Manhattan's Lower East Side, Smith did some amateur theatrics for his church and small theatrical companies before he decided politics would be his field. He looks like he's having a rollicking good time in a rendition of the Bowery.\n\nAlways love films like these.",
