Nor pretentious like others pretended to believe. It is a really fun movie to watch..I find no better way nor phrase to express it. \n\nEvery aspect of the film, be it tragic incidents, comic relief or just plain student-life-reality, has got such a kinetic energy to it that you never get bored. Even when subject matter delves into territory of clich√©, movie's execution is so bloody brilliant that you somehow feel brazenly energetic. A movie for the young of heart.",
