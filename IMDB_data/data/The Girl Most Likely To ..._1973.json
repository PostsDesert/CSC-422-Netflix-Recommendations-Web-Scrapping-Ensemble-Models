I recall seeing it in 1973, as a senior in college, on my portable black-and-white TV set in my dorm room. I was studying and sort of halfway missed the first half-hour, but eventually I was so intrigued that I set aside the books and watched the rest. \n\nThe transformation of the Stockard Channing character in the course of her accident and plastic surgery is so striking that I truly did not know that she played both the \"before\" and \"after\" versions until reading the IMDB credits and user comments today.\n\nI can only echo the requests of others to please re-issue this film on DVD."
