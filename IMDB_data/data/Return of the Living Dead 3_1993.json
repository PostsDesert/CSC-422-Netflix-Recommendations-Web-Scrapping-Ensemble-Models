However, she has a hunger that can not be controlled and she starts munching on various people's flesh that they run into. Now, she has accidently created her own army of the undead. \n\nBetter then you would expect with a good premise, pretty good direction an emotional finale and some smart jabs. However most the acting is cheesy, the effects are over the top and seem to belong in another film given the serious tone. However, watching Sarah Douglas chew the scenery is always fun!\n\nUnrated; Sexual Situations, Profanity, Nudity and Graphic Violence."
