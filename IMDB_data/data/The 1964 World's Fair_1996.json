I've seen a few others which were about as good and just as entertaining....so I was eager to watch \"The 1964 World's Fair\". Overall, I did enjoy it but it came up a bit short against these other documentaries. Why? Well, the production values weren't great--with some cheap sounding (and everpresent) music and a direct-to-video look. Worth seeing...but see some of the other films first.",
