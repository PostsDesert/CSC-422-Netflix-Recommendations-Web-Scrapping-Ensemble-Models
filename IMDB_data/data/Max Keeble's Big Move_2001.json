I took my 11 yo son to see it, and he had no problem understanding that.\n\nIsn't this movie supposed to be an extreme comic view of the unfair world of junior high from an underdog's point of view? Think of The Three Stooges - did anybody take their scripts to task? No, but everybody LAUGHED!\n\nBetter judgment triumphs in the end in most respects, in Max Keeble's Big Move. And Max earns respect not because he's the toughest, but because his turnabout beats the bullies at their own game, and because he won't let his buddies take the rap alone.\n\nThis movie, and Shrek, See Spot Run, Cats & Dogs, and Spy Kids, are some of the most enjoyable movies I have seen in the last 10 months. Not since \"What Women Want\" or \"The Brothers\" have I seen an adult movie that was near as funny as any of these kiddie movies. (Okay, add in \"Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou\".)\n\nI only hope that overly critical attitudes aren't congenital."
