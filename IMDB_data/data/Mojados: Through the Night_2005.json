I honestly felt that this was an excellent and compassionate picture about true-life of the immigrants; that we don't get to see everyday. The style Davis saturates this film with is incredible. I have never imagined the hardships and endurance it takes to complete such a journey.Fore most this film takes you on an \"emotional journey\" as well. This film has altered my perception on what life stands for. The innocence that lies in each character is WOW. I would honestly have to say that this film ranks itself right next to \"Lawrence of Arabia\" This film leaves you guessing.",
