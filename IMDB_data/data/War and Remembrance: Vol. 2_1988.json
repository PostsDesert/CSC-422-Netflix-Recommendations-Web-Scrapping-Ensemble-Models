All elements of this production are astounding: casting, acting, writing, historical accuracy, filming, locations, not to mention the haunting music. \n\nMany of my students have told me that seeing this series changed their view and motivation of the importance of historical knowledge and the passing of it from generation to generation. They have even formed outside discussion groups because the allotted class time is never enough to accommodate the forum required for voicing and digesting their thoughts and feelings brought on by the film. This is a film for the ages.",
