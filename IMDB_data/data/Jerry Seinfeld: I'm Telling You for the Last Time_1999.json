Jerry are here showing that he can stand on an empty stage with just a glass of water and make you laugh for 78 minutes. The different jokes are so well mixed together that it forms a whole story at the end.\n\nI think this show can make anybody laugh even though they don't like the \"Seinfeld show\". But if you are a Seinfeld fan,this is a MUST.\n\nThis is truly the best stand-up show ever."
