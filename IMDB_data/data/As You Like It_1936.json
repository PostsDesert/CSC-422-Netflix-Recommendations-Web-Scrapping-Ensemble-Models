        "reviewBody": "The main role, Rosalind, is well-played by the cute, vivacious Bergner. Olivier is good with the physical stuff (very graceful) and the repartee. He tends to fall flat on the soliloquies and extended reveries, though. (And he's wearing way too much makeup, including at times some very crooked lipstick.) The costumes and sets are vivid, probably meant to suggest a fairy-tale, and thus account for the ridiculous plot devices.\n\nAnd despite the comments of another reviewer, the camera-work is not all \"point-and-shoot.\" It is a bit static by today's standards, but not by those of 1936.\n\nThe biggest liability is the muddy, distant sound.\n\nAll in all, I liked it more than the average filmed Shakespeare, though it's not great by any means.",
