        "reviewBody": "This was a classic case of \"What did they expect?\" You were going there to work, not play. The crew--especially the kitchen crew (including the French chef)--was full of whiners. So what if the Family did not have to speak to you? Haven't you worked at a job where management acted like class snobs? What's the difference? I had a boss a lot like the chef (really, I did). There were times when I turned my head and cried, and times when I yelled back at him (I will note he always won the arguments). But overall, I knew what the person expected, and no matter what a victim I was, I did things how they wanted them done.\n\nAnyway, I like this series. I thought it was very well done and not scripted. People are used to soft lives and not expressing their emotions. In real life, people get mad. People don't always like their jobs. However, complaining and not doing your job because you don't like something is no solution. \n\nAs SuperChicken used to tell Fred, \"You knew the job was dangerous when you took it!\"",
