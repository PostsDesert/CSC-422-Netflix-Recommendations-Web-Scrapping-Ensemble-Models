        "reviewBody": "While \"Needing You\" (aka \"Goo nam gwa lui\") is a pretty straightforward, if not generic actually, romantic comedy, there is just something that works quite marvelously about it.\n\nPerhaps it is the adorable storyline that writers Cindy Tang, Ka-Fai Wai and Nai-Hoi Yau managed to put together, or the adept skill of bringing the script to life from established directors Johnnie To and Ka-Fai Wai. But it may also be the on-screen chemistry that there was between lead actor Andy Lau and lead actress Sammi Cheng.\n\nI hadn't seen \"Needing You\" before now in 2021, as I had the opportunity to sit down to watch it. And I must say that it was an entertaining romantic comedy. Sure, this is one of those a dime a dozen romantic comedies, but if you enjoy such movies, then \"Needing You\" is definitely well worth checking out.\n\nThere is a good pacing to the storyline and there are enough variation in the plot to keep it interesting from start until end. Sure, it is predictable, and the movie pans out and ends exactly as you foresee, but it was, nonetheless, an enjoyable ride.\n\n\"Needing You\" also have names like Shiu Hung Hui and Suet Lam on the cast list, so if you are familiar with Hong Kong cinema during the 1990s and 2000s, then you will recognize these two actors.\n\nI found \"Needing You\" to be a nice surprise and it was definitely an enjoyable romantic comedy. I am rating this 2000 Hong Kong movie a solid six out of ten stars.",
