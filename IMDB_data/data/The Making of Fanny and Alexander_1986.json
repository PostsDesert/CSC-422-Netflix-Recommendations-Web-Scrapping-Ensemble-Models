        "reviewBody": "The next best thing to watching Bergman's films is for me to watch and listen to him talking about himself and about his works. \"Making of\" is a fascinating document - I always wanted to know how he makes his films, what is behind the poetry of images and the sound of silence. Following the master's steps, watching the most magical scenes born in front of you, seeing him in control of his production, always knowing what he wants and leading his crew and his actors; his longtime friendship with his legendary cinematographer Swen Nykwist to the point that they don't talk much - they don't need many words to understand each other - all of these made \"Making of Fanny and Alexander\" absolutely unique and amazing experience for me. The birth of each scene is a miracle but some of them stand out. The first is one of the most enigmatic and magical scenes ever and not only in Bergman's films - night scene in the Isak's house between Alexander and Ismael, a completely mysterious character with supernatural psychic powers who helped Alexander to unleash his own powers he never knew he had. \n\nThe second is the scene with Gunnar Björnstrand, one of the most versatile Bergman's actors (Höstsonaten, (1978), Ansikte mot ansikte (1976), Skammen (1968), Persona (1966), Nattvardsgästerna (1963), Såsom i en spegel (1961), Ansiktet (1958), Smultronstället (1957), Sommarnattens leende (1955), and his masterpiece Det Sjunde inseglet, (1957)). He was old and apparently ill while making Fanny and Alexander which was his last film. The scene in \"Making of...\" is almost 20 minutes long and shows over and over how Bergman rehearses a short, perhaps one or two minute long cameo with Björnstrand as clown Feste in Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\". It is painful to watch a great actor in such a pitiful state. At some point you'd want Bergman to stop what seems like a torture but he goes on, encouraging his friend, praising him, making sure that Gunnar feels comfortable but not stopping before the scene is shot to his liking...",
