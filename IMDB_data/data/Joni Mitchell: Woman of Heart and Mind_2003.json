I'm delighted that I bought it - apart from Both Sides Now I had not been a particular fan, but having seen this I now have the most profound respect for a true 100% musical genius. Countless clips of unforgettable and deeply touching performances by Joni - beautiful juxtaposition of contextual and biographical episodes - and many many insightful contributions from contemporaries, fellow artists like D Crosby, J Taylor and G Nash, friends (and lovers), and of course from JM herself.\n\nHope to see some comments from JM fans, as I'd love to hear their views. As a visual profile of this kind, I have seen nothing to better this....",
