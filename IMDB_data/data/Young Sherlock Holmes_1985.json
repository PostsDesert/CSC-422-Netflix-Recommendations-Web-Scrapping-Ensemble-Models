The only drawback was the absurd dealing with the \"flying machine.\" Other than that, sit back and enjoy as Watson and Holmes embark on their alleged first adventure as Holmes tries to find the link between a rash of recent murders, hallucinations people have been having, and a cult. Not a bad way to spend a few hours of your time!\n\n** 1/2 out of ****"
