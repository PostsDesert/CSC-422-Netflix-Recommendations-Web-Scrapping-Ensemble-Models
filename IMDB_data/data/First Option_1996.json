Naturally, the headstrong leader of this team (played by Michael Wong) has his hands full fighting the bureaucratic HK Police command, and the crooks trying to smuggle \"Ice\" into the city. What's an iconclastic hero to do? Well, it seems if one looks bored enough, and this star does, one simply has to do a lot of sermonizing and go through the typical \"movie cop\" angst. The action, what little is there (don't waste your time looking for genuine \"suspense\") is enough to solicit yawns from teenage males, whom normally chew this sort of movie up. It really kind of came off as a VERY long \"Just Say No\" public service announcement. It's not awful, just way short of an rational attempts to define the term mediocre.",
