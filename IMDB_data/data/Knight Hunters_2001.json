        "reviewBody": "I think what makes this series so enjoyable, is the undeniable potential. I can honestly say this is one of my favorite animes, simply because the concept behind it is so intriguing, and the characters, although sometimes lamely displayed, are complex. The main problem with the storyline is the presentation; the dialogue and character actions can be very trite, and the plot has some really big holes. Despite all that, I'd still give it a ten because I enjoyed it so much. Great music, outstanding character designs, and a memorable plot line makes for an addicting anime certainly worth taking time to watch. One bit of advice though; avoid the English dubbing and go straight for the subtitles."
