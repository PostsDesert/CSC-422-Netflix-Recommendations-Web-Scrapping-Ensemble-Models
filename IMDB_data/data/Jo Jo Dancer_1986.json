        "reviewBody": "I've always enjoyed \"Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling\" but it does have more than its fair share of flaws. The movie just doesn't work as well as it should have. Maybe Richard Pryor should have handed the direction off to a seasoned veteran rather than trying to do it himself. I don't know. The alter-ego stuff works well in some scenes and not that well in others. Visually the alter-ego is almost never convincing. \"Jo Jo Dancer\" is well acted but it seems to be longer than it actually is. The scenes with young Jo Jo are great. The \"accident\" scene is heartbreaking. Much of the stand up stuff isn't that good, especially Jo Jo's strip scene (ouch). I still watch this movie from time to time but it's just not completely satisfying. (I saw \"Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling\" in the theater when it first came out.)",
