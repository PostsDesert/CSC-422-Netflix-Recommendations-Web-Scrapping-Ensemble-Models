I cannot imagine anyone but Redford playing Roy Hobbs. The background music is superb. Several years ago I took my family to Cooperstown,NY to visit the Baseball Hall of Fame. The main musical theme was playing as part of a baseball video.\n\nAlthough the climax of the movie was excellent, I think the scene in Chicago where Glenn Close stood up and Hobbs hit the home run that broke the tower clock was definitely my favorite.\n\nWhenever I feel a little depressed, I know it's time to pop the video in the vcr."
