And then she won an Emmy. Against actors that people had actually heard of.\n\nI only bring this up because that great documentary that's making the rounds (\"The Golden Age of Broadway\") quotes about half a dozen or more highly respected stage veterans who all sing Kim Stanley's praises.\n\nKim Stanley acted without affect: That could occasionally appear slight. What it was was that she was so busy giving it up that she forgot to show you where and how she was acting.\n\nAnd, again, show me a better Big Momma, like, ever..."
