        "reviewBody": "I've seen the movie on a premiere night and the taste that I had after watching it was that I really saw the life, in 3 days, of 5 different people. The movie never really managed to be shown in Greece, not to mention Great Halls. But all the other commercial crap that I have seen 2 years after this film, make me believe that the movie factory is a game of advertising and here we have an unjustified looser. This movie never really had the super hero inside or the super actor or the super body or breasts inside. It was real life. Some might say that the acting was that of a soap opera. Major Mistake. What are we supposed to consider as acting? Good make-up tears and heart throbbing script? The film really deserved 10 out of 10 and the actors made me really believe that they felt their characters.\n\nNikolas\n\nP.S. Hope to see it in DVD form, soon.",
