I came across this little \"**** nugget\" and the cover screamed \"Rent me!\"... Now, I've seen a lot of bad horror films in my life, but this one is just wrong on SO many levels... It is completely mind boggling that some film production company payed actual money to have this thing made... There is nothing salvageable here, bad cinematography (if you could call it that), horrible acting, despicable script and the editing... You can actually see the cameraman in several scenes!\n\nAgain, I will take full blame for not reading the back cover. Had I done so, the name \"Ron Jeremy\" would have jumped out at me, and I would have looked around for creepy guys in trench-coats, thinking I was at the wrong video store...\n\nThis thing deserves no rating."
