It's empowering to women, and demonstrates how the premise of Remmington Steele's whole premise could actually happen. And you thought it was silly! Bah! Whooopie is awesome in this feature, and really commands the presence of an executive, but just beneath that corporate demeanor, lies the bad-a$$ who beat the snot out of \"Ray\" in Burglar. In spite of that, I loved it. Though it'll never win even a nomination, it was fun.\n\nWhoopie? Work more in FRONT of the camera! I miss you! This rates a 5.8/10 from...\n\nthe Fiend :.",
