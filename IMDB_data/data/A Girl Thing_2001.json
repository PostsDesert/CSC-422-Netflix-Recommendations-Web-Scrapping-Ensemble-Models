        "reviewBody": "Excellent direction and acting in this TV movie from a great ensemble cast make it a must-see. In a time when many actresses complain Hollywood doesn't give them the opportunities, in this production a whole range of women from well-known names (e.g. Mia Farrow, Rebecca de Mornay) to the less well-known, turn in excellent performances all round. And the men are good too. The four stories appear in linear fashion, linked by Stockard Channing's character as a therapist among others, are all good and sufficiently different to each other to hold interest. The sensationalism that might surround the first story should not be allowed to disproportionately affect the view of the show as a whole. Funny and warm, this is a film for everyone, despite it's title. TV movies are often considered less favourably to cinema productions, but there are just as many good and bad TV movies as films and this as good as, or better, than a lot of films I've seen at the cinema (and I've seen a lot!) Highly recommended.",
