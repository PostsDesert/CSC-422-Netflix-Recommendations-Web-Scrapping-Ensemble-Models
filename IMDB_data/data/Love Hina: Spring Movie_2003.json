This dig takes place on an island overrun by...you guessed it: turtles. Meanwhile, back at the Hina household, the girls feel worried about their manager and decide to go look for him. This special focuses on promises and being able to keep them.\n\nThis is another very enjoyable special from the Love Hina series. Like the series, expect lots of laughs and soap opera like drama. Must see for all Love Hina fans \n\noverall: full of cuteness and laughter: 8/10\n\nrecommend if: *you're a fan of the Love Hina series *you love anime/animation\n\navoid if: *you haven't watched/finished watching the Love Hina series"
