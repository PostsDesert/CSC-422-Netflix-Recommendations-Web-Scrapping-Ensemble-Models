        "reviewBody": "\"1942 A Love story\" is a portray of a beautiful love story with the backdrop of the Indian struggle for freedom.The plot is still the same of a love story but unlike other Bollywood movies the villains are not the parents but the political turmoil of 1942.\n\nVidhu Vinod who was just three movie old when he made this movie teams up with the genius Sanjay Leela Bhansali ( screenplay) to deliver a movie which is definitely the best of 93.With an impressive star cast of Anil Kapoor, Prem , Jackie Shroff,Danny, Ashish Vidyarthi and Anupam Kher this one could have never gone wrong.\n\nThe story runs on two parallel lines one is the love story between Rajjo(Manisha Koirala) and Narender(Anil Kapoor). The other story is about the assassination of general Douglas.\n\nTHe music of the movie is absolutely amazing R.D.Burman delivers yet another masterpiece which was unfortunately his last. Manisha Koirala fits so well in the role of an innocent and beautiful young girl.THe introductory scene of Manisha Koirala is absolutely amazing.\"Ek Ladki KO \" and Kuch Na Kaho are one of the best pasteurized songs. Kuch Na Kaho gets you into the moment so well.THe on screen kiss if definitely one of the best on the Indian screen.\n\nJaved Akhtar wrote the songs that are just a brilliant example of superb poetry.THe songs are a part of the story and since they are so good you don't get irritated when they pop up unlike other Hindi movies.\n\nThe story takes a sharp turn just before the interval after the death of Anupam Kher when Manisha Koirala is rescued by Jackie Shroff and the conditions forces Anil Kapoor to jump into the struggle of Indian independence.\n\nperformance wise Jackie steals the show delivering the role of a young and self driven freedom fighter he is able to portray the emotions and feelings to picture perfect.BUt that does not undermines the performances of other actors.\n\nI give this movie a 9 out of 10 a must watch for people who believe that Indian cinema is not dead yet and there are great film- makers who will deliver the best when ever they could",
