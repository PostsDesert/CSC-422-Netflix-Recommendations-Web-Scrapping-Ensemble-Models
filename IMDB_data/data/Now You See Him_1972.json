And yet again, Dean Higgins is in need of money. Makes you wonder what happened with all the money Medfield was awarded in the first film.\n\nThis film wasn't always readily available from the Disney library, not until they were releasing the Dexter Riley trilogy on dvd. Therefore, that made the film somewhat obscure and almost unknown. One of the downfalls of this installment is that Professor Quigley (William Schallert) wasn't involved in the production. He was replaced without explanation, but does reappear in The Strongest Man in the World. Richard Bakalyan returns but as a nephew to A.J. Arno.\n\nHowever, the film is funny and the special effects were great for the time period. It's a very family friendly film.",
