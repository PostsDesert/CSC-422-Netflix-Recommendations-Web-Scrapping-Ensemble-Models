In addition, the Inspector General (OIG) in involved in an investigation of \"deleted\" surveillance videos of alleged patient abuse at the Las Vegas VA Emergency Room. With these and many more \"concerns\" about the Department of Veteran Affairs and the on-going problems at their facilities, this movie should be re-released. Perhaps it would be prudent for all Staff at the Department of Veterans Affairs to view this movie as part of their \"Welcome to the VA\". It appears not much has changed at the VA since 1992 - 22 years ago."
