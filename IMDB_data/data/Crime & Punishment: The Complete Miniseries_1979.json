        "reviewBody": "I found the first couple of episodes hard to watch because the main character seemed all over the place, like he was over acting how erratic he was. He wasn't and that was obvious as I persevered past ep2. It's a great series with (like the negative reviews say) lots of mini plots but when it all slots into place you understand why those were needed. Very well written and acted and anybody who's experienced any of the topics raised can relate. Give it the chance it deserves its well worth it. It's raw and gritty just as you'd expect from Irvine Welsh.",

He believes the murderer is the serial killer Mister Confectioner. But his bosses believe Confectioner is behind bars. Lennox's insistence that they have the wrong man puts him not just in conflict with his bosses, but also onto the radar of Confectioner himself. So the detective is drawn into a cat and mouse game with the killer.",
