The plot is very simple and all of the players move in and out of \"the deal\" at different times. The \"deal\" even begins to take on a life of its own with most of the characters compromising their interests to be a part of it. Very good character studies. I think this movie should have used all of the actors real names, as it seemed contrived to have a fictional name for Anouk Aimee."
