I feel as though I've grown up with most of these people. Y&R has improved so much over the years with the added realism of the story lines by adding in humor and clever little comments that us ordinary folks might say in daily life. So many other soaps are so dramatic because they seem like they're always trying to win an Oscar. The story lines on other soaps are not like real life and perhaps that's what some people like but for me I like having something I can relate too.\n\nY&R has the best actors/actresses and writers. My only hope is one day they start releasing episodes on DVD."
