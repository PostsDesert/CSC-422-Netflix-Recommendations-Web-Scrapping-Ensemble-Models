        "reviewBody": "\"The Misfits\" is literally about four people who don't fit into society A divorcée (Monroe) meets cowboy Langland (Gable), who is getting too old for his job They decide to live together A former rodeo star (Clift) and an unemployed mechanic (Wallach) join in the drifting \n\nHuston's masculine images are stripped of their former glory, existing only one rough exterior which fails to conceal what has been lost Eventually the men agree to round up wild mustangs for a dog food manufacturer \n\nScenes of the trio and Monroe speeding across the prairie in a beaten-up truck, raising a hurricane of dust while attempting to rope the stallions, are the strongest evocations of lost souls wandering in time \n\nHuston's film established Marilyn Monroe as a dramatic sensuous actress, thus liberating her from a decade of steamy cheesecake roles in sexy comedies",
