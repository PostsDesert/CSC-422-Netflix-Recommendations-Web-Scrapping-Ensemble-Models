        "reviewBody": "This is one of those movies that suffers from painfully poor reviews here at the IMDb, from people who are the most pretentious film snobs you will ever not meet. If you are going to judge this film against something with legitimate cinematic merit, like Citizen Kane, or Seven Samurai, or whatever stock staple film you choose, of course you will be disappointed.\n\nHowever, if you just want a ridiculous early 90's teen film for a little escapist fun whilst flipping through the channels at 4am on a Saturday night, then you could do a lot worse than this movie. If you are a big fan of teen movies in particular, you may find this pretty enjoyable. It's no Breakfast Club, don't get me wrong. It's complete crap. But it's fun crap.\n\nSo, if you are the kind of person who generally enjoys teen movies and has a high tolerance for zany antics, over the top performances, and silly plots, then you should watch this movie in the event that you happen across it.\n\nIf you are the kind of person who refuses to acknowledge anything as cinema except for films produced during the French New Wave, then not only should you avoid this movie, but also, maybe not waste so much time and energy criticizing it so harshly, you Godard-watching hippie.",
