        "reviewBody": "For anyone who has ever seen or even heard of Dave Matthews Band, this is a must own. This performance proves that DMB is one of the best live performances that money can buy.\n\nThe performance starts out with \"Don't Drink the Water,\" a very good song to start the energy of the concert with. The band does a very good job mixing the songs together for an easy transaction from one song to the next. The real start of the concert starts with the song \"Ants Marching.\" This is in my opinion, the best version of the song. There is no long intro, but the song is filled with energy and joy. Every band member does an amazing job at making this song one of the best during the show.\n\nJimi Thing is another fantastic song. It is almost 17 minutes long and awesome every second of it. About ten minutes of the song is a jam with Warren Haynes playing on the electric guitar. Mr. Dave himself does a scat for about a minute and a half. One of the best scats he's ever done.\n\nOverall, this performance is pure awesome. A must own for any DMB fan.",
