Following 2 people on personal journeys, brought together by events to cure a real physical problem each has. Ultimately realizing that with or without a cure reality for each is only what their own perceptions create. The very nature of perception and reality is opened up, in a delightfully playful and twisting drama.\n\nAs with most (but not all) Lelouch films, well worth watching and taking in at the next level.",
