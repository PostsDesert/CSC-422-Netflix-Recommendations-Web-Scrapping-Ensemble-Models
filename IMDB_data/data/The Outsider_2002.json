        "reviewBody": "This is a very satisfying western.It is set in the 19th century American West, but some elements would fit in a more modern genre. \"Witness\" comes to mind. There are also similarities to \"Shane\". A badly wounded gunfighter is nursed back to health by a young widow with a son, who happens to be a member of an Amish-like sect. The script is good with a mixture of romance, sexual tension, and enough gun play for any western fan. Of course it has its bad guys, and good guys, and a not so good guy,the gunfighter, Johnny Gualt. He is played by the talented Tim Daly who does an excellent and believable job, as does Naomi Watts. The supporting cast includes both David and Keith Carradine. The movie is currently popping up on Hallmark Channel. Its so good, it deserves a wider release, but it started on HBO, and is not likely to challenge the record for a cable western belonging to Tom Selleck and \"Crossfire Trail\". But, \"Try it, you'll like it\"",
