Actually, it's a pretty bad movie. \n\nActing is terrible, and the script does not make sense. I really didn't understand what the hell the writer and director was trying to say here. I have a feeling he doesn't either :)\n\nThe idea of parallel universes and exchanging lives has been extensively used in movies, and this movie does not bring any new message.\n\nI don't want to waste any more time ranting about it. Just to warn potential viewers to skip this one and watch something else.",
