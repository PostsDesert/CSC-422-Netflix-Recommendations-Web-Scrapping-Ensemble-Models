        "reviewBody": "I loved this movie for many reasons: \n\nThe film history : it's the first collaboration between Akira Kurosawa (director) and Toshiro Mifune (actor) that continued through 15 more films including the sublime Rashomon, Seven Samurai and Yojimbo.\n\nThe style : it's a great film noir with gangsters, zoot suits, speakeasy's, gambling etc., \n\nThe history : post WW II Japan is a frightening place with rubble, raw sewage, crime and hope. It's a world I hadn't seen before.\n\nToshiro Mifune : What an amazing actor. He oozes charisma and you cannot take your eyes off of him. His performance reminded me of the first time I saw Russell Crowe, in a little seen mediocre movie called \"For the Moment\" which I watched many times because of Crowe's intensity.\n\nMy only problem is the copy I saw was terrible. The print was faded and half of the subtitles were illegible. When will this be released on DVD? It's not Kurosawa's best film, but it's certainly better than most of the drivel out there.",
