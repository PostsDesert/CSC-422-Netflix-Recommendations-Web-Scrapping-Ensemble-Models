        "reviewBody": "It is interesting to approach a dogmatic movie w/out allowing my own personal values system to intrude on my aesthetic judgement - and it was in this spirit of adventure that I decided to watch this appalling excuse for a TV movie.\n\nIt is ironic, but I find that - for some reason - many of these flawed attempts at grand Christian filmmaking have much in common with their cinematic-theological antithesis : the seventies cycle of cheap, rip-off Satanic Posession movies. Primarily, derivative pulp thriller scripts with religion awkwardly shoehorned in, poor production values, hollow rhetoric, Soap Opera standard actors and absolutely no love of the medium whatsoever.\n\nIt is strange that this cycle of films has now created a cliche so strong that christian filmmaking now has such a bad reputation amongst moviegoers (whatever their religion), that the genre is a byword for pictures to avoid. This should not necessarily be the case - look at the big budget biblical epics of the 50s and 60s or the thoughtful (and occassionally chilling) deconstruction of fundamentalism in Bill Paxtons \"Frailty\".\n\nNevertherless - this movie is possibly one of the worst films ever made, right up (down) there with \"24 Hours in London\" & \"Camp Blood\" (the latter I only saw by accident - honest). Perhaps I'm being a little bit harsh, but you've got to be cruel to be kind and I think its time for this cycle of movies to be put to sleep."
