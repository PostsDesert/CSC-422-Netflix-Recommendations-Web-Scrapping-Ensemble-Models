In my humble opinion, Jamie Johnson did a fine job of humanizing himself and his subjects in a way that ,for me, promoted compassion and understanding for persons \"different\" than myself. Any filmmaker that has the ability and the resources to promote understanding of persons different than ourselves has a talent that hopefully will not be wasted.",
