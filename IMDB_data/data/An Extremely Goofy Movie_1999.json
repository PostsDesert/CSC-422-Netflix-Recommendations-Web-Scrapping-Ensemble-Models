        "reviewBody": "I was a big fan of the original 'A Goofy Movie' and was eagerly awaiting the sequel when I saw an advertisement for it prior to Thanksgiving in 1999.\n\nAn Extremely Goofy Movie takes place Four or five years after the original and involves Goofy's son Max going off to collage and freedom. This depresses the Goof who then is fired from his job at a toy factory. In today's economy one cannot get a good job without a degree and the Goof decides to go back to collage, the same college as Max.\n\nMax on the other hand has visions of freedom and the 'X games' dancing in his head and presumably girls and keggers as well; though he former is glossed over and the latter ignored for the sake of the small set. These dreams are rudely interrupted by the return of Goofy who, dressed in '70's clothes, immediately begins treating his boy as, well his boy.\n\nMax must contend with both his father and a group of yuppie skum low lives known as the gammas. The gammas are all about winning at any cost and not above cheating to accomplish that.\n\nA sub plot involves Goofy dating the school's librarian and the only other person in the world who shares Goofy's affinity for the '70s.\n\nAt its heart 'An Extremely Goofy Movie' is about how despite the fact that children grow up there is still a bond between parent and child that cannot be broken. It does this without becoming too sappy and always retains its good humor. My only complaint is that Disney did not release it to theaters first this is definitely a movie that would have worked on the big screen. Go buy it or at least rent it.",
