I'm not particularly interested in space exploration - we have enough challenges on terra firma - but this short film is awesome. Especially in 3-D.\n\nI'd love to know how they maneuvered the notoriously bulky and complex IMAX cameras around the International Space Station. The film is at once intimate (isn't everything up there?) and yet broad in its grandeur.\n\nIf someone had been waiting outside the theater as we emerged with petitions demanding more money for the space program I would have added my signature.\n\nThis film is for everyone!"
