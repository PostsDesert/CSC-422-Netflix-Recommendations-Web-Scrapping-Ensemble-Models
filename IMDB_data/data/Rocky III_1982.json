If someone told me what is it about, I would be like - Really, Sylvester, how long do you think you can take people's money by simply rearranging the same movie in slightly different arrangements?! The answer is - Obviously longer than common sense allows. The movie was blockbuster, it launched the song \"Eye of the Tiger\" in unbelievable heights, and it achieved crazy success in every way. However crazy it may sound, rearranging of the Rocky story works and it works well. The story is good, acting and directing too, the soundtrack kicks ass, and the movie keeps attention from the first till the very last moment, and it really leaves a strong impression. I'm a little bit ashamed to like it, but I really do, very much.\n\n8/10",
