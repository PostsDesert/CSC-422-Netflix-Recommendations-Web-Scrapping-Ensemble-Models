        "reviewBody": "When a group of Internet friends gather at the beach their fun is quickly ruined when a vacation turns into a murderous rampage. Although the plot is simple, and although much of the occurrences throughout the film are, at times, predictable, the movie is very well executed.\n\nThe cinematography of Bloody Beach (Haebyeoneuro Gada) was very impressive and an unexpected surprise. Unique camera angles were often employed and the perspectives from which it was filmed were also very eye-catching. This made up for some of the unoriginality of the script. It was entertaining enough to keep one's attention, though not enough to highly recommend. Many of the bloody action sequences keep you enthralled as well as the occasional plot twisting and misleading. However, in the end, it is not enough to make the film highly recommendable or distinguished.",
