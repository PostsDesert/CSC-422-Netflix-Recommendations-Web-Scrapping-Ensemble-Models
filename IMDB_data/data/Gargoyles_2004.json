        "reviewBody": "In this movie, the gargoyles deserve to take the earth. It feels like they're the only one taking this whole movie seriously.\n\nThe premise of the film is gargoyles which are mythical creature; they fall somewhere between demons, bats, dragons but just looks like a meaner Dracula in the bat form from Van Helsing. These gargoyles then meaninglessly kill a lot of people. And, it's up to our hero to save the day and the world.\n\nThe CGI is awesome and it's stuff right out of \"Van helsing\" with the bat/human flying creature and the countless spawns flying around. The sets are awesome. The action scenes and car chases are tight.\n\nBut, the acting is really bad. The way the movie is between the action scenes is really bad. Also, the story is really bad. But, the gargoyles are really mean and they do some really cool stuff.\n\nThe main action here's lethargic way of dialog makes him seem dumb; the blond girl doesn't look sexy enough or forceful enough - she just feels ordinary and without an interesting character; the girl who plays the scientist doesn't really act like one. \n\nThis is really low on quality in the genre of monster movies - except for the monster itself. \n\nNot really worth watching."
