This is an extremely bizarre movie, but contains a few scenes of absolute brilliance. You just have to give it a chance.\n\nConsidering that it was made in 1964, it's really a masterpiece of \"modern\" cinema. Granted, by today's standards it is at times a little corny or dated, but overall it holds up.\n\nYou simply cannot miss this if it comes along on cable. There is nothing else quite like it."
