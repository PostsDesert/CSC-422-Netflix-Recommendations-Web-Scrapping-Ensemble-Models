        "reviewBody": "I saw this movie in 2018. But in past i used to listen to its background theme. Had always heard about this movie, But never saw it before. And i really enjoyed it. Even after 37 years, this movie seems as fresh as it was when it released. This movie have aged well with the time. First time saw Kurt Russell and Lee Van Cleef face to face in one on the big screen. But mind me Lee van cleef is not the Antagonist in this movie. But the person who sends snake plissken to new york on the rescue mission. looking both of them i remembered John Rambo & Col. Trautman. In all a nice & watchable movie. In this movie John Carpenter shows he can make movies in this genre also. And he succeeded also.",
