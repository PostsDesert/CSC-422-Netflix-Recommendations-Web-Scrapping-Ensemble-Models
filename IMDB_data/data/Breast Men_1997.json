        "reviewBody": "\"Breast is better\", nursing mothers were told, but to a lot of American men, \"bigger is better.\" I suppose the only way for a man to know how a woman feels about this is to imagine a society in which, first, penises were displayed in public (as in some traditional societies in Melanesia), and second, where women preferred bigger ones (not terribly likely, though it does appear Gay men do).\n\nThis little rather over-dramatised documentary made for TV traces the story of two male doctors from Texas who developed the silicone breast implant, fell out, made fortunes from thousands of insecure women and then hit the liability wall. One of them, played by David Schwimmer, then had the entrepreneurial imagination, not to say hide, to make another fortune removing unwanted and defective implants. It's a wonderful trip down the Primrose Path to Perdition powered by affluence and primal urges. There are more bunnies than Playboy and more breasts than a chicken shop but it's not particularly sexploitational in tone. In fact it's a moral tale. Mobile phones combined with primal urges and motoring can be fatal. Seriously, this movie is a great deal better than it might have been."
