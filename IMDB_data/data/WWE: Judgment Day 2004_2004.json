        "reviewBody": "In chronological order:\n\n1) Rey Mysterio and Rob Van Dam vs. The Dudley Boyz. In terms of technique, probably the best match of the entire show! Rob Van Dam has some pretty impressive moves, and both he and Rey Mysterio are good with their legs. The \"blind\" referee is also pretty funny in this one. *** \n\n2) Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie. OK, this match is a little clumsy, but Torrie looks really great and both ladies apply at least one good hold each. **1/2 \n\n3) Scotty 2 Hotty vs. Mordecai. A brief and almost totally one-sided match. Mordecai has potential, but Scotty should change his name to Not-So-Hotty. *1/2 \n\n4) Rico and Charlie Haas vs. Hardcore Holly and Billy Gunn. HH is not bad, but this match offers little more than some lame \"gay\" antics courtesy of Rico. *\n\n5) Jacqueline vs. Chavo Guerrero. A half-hearted attempt at a mixed match, with Chavo wrestling (initially) with one hand tied up behind his back. In my opinion, if they thought Jacqueline was up for a mixed match, they should have made it a regular one. If they thought she wasn't, they should have skipped it altogether. **\n\n6) John Cena vs. Rene Dupree. The setup is too long, and the payoff is not worth it. A forgettable match. *1/2 \n\n7) The Undertaker vs. Booker T. The supposed \"big event\" of the night is a \"big letdown\". The introduction of The Undertaker is long and not very scary if you're over 3 years old, and in general this is one of those matches where the fakeness is just too obvious. *1/2 \n\n8) Eddie Guerrero vs. John Bradshaw. Those who prefer no-rules streetfighting over actual wrestling, will probably enjoy this surprisingly bloody battle. For the rest of us, there are some good ground holds, executed mostly by Bradshaw. **1/2\n\nThere is also A LOT of filler between the matches, but you should be used to that by now.",
