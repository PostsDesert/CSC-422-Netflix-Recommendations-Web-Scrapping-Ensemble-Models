I could never imagine the great actor would have signed up to play this father/husband/grand father/retiree role, because the screenplay is so bad, so phony and the director of this movie, in my opinion, should be banned from directing any movie from 2003. Yes, that's how bad this movie is.\n\nI just don't know how could this poor screenplay would be made into movie. From the very beginning, the loving husband and loving wife were so poorly acted and performed as a couple. All the scenes from the very beginning were just so overdone and so pretentious. All the characters, old or young, male or female, were just thoroughly ruined by this pathetic screenplay and the director. This is the first Bollywood movie that has made our watching a complete disgusting experience. It's more like a typical Korean TV drama, everybody had to murmur to herself or himself, with exaggerated gestures, expressions.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan is one of the greatest Hindi actors, maybe the best of the bests, a Hindi Clark Gable + Gary Cooper + Marlon Brando, but..."
