        "reviewBody": "The Adventures of Ichabod is an October favorite for us; this year we watched both together. The adventures of Mr. Toad is a bit slower, and mostly of interest because of the wonderful Disneyland ride. Seb seems to have loved \"Mr. Winkie,\" and seemed surprised that he was evil, despite the name.\n\nReviewing in 2020, the first time we watched it after a fabulous weekend in Sleepy Hollow last year. I was struck by how much they laughed at the first part of the show, which is almost entirely slapstick/romantic comedy, followed by a sudden shift in mood at the Halloween party, where Brom Bones sings his song about the horsemen, leading into terror for the rest of the film. My kids made a great observation: there's no dialogue in Ichabod, only the voice of the narrator, Bing Crosby, and Brom Bones' song.",
