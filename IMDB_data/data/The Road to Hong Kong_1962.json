I would hate to be that person's parents if he/she believes that people in their 60's belong in retirement homes! You're never too old for goofy adventures.\n\nAs it happens, H&C were 59 when they did this final Road picture, and it was definitely not their best work. The plot is even thinner than previous farces without the superb timing and camaraderie we associate with the two.\n\nFar sadder is the way they ditched their witty and lovely partner Dorothy Lamour for a girl half their age; Joan Collins was 29 when she scampered around with the pair. This is a painful mirror of our society's tacit approval for older men to dump their wives for a younger model.\n\nBy far the funniest scene features Peter Sellers as a ditzy neurologist."
