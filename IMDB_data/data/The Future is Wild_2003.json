The series has the same basic theme as his book After Man; what will animals be like far in the future? The series looks at three time periods, each in which life is given a different challenge. 5 million years from now, and the Earth is in the grip of a new ice age. 100 million years from now, and it's the opposite, the whole world is very hot and wet. My favorite part is 200 million years from now, in which a mass extinction has wiped out all familiar forms of life. I don't want to give away too much about the creatures that inhabit these future worlds. Go see it for yourself, because If this show is in any way correct in its speculation, the future is truly going to be wild!",
