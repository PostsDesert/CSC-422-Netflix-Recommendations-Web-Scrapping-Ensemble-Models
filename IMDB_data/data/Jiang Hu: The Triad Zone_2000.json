It get me confused that what is an exact explanation to this word \"Jiang Hu'', maybe \"lawless world\" or \"underworld\". One scene in this film is a police asking Leung Kai Fai what is \"Jiang Hu\" in English, and Leung never answered but smiled. No one ever knows what \"Jiang Hu\" is as we never experienced a time like this. It is surprising that this film produced in 2000 should have made such a great wonder. Next time I want to see this film with my boyfriend:), he is Aries as well.",
