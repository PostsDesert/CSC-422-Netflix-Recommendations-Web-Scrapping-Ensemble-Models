Even though it is wonderful, I prefer the orginal cantonese and brasilian portuguese dub version. I could not help to notice in Korea and JApan, that they have edited or cut out some scenes (even though in both Korea and Japan version have nudity, there are alot other than pubic hair they cut out), while the original Hong Kong version, as well as the Portuguese dubbed version, it is totally 100% uncut! If any chance, see those versions! You will dig it, I garantee!"
