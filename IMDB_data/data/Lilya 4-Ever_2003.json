The events shown in this movie actually happened and happen in every town from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea. Lilja is my neighbor, too.\n\nI am a guy who had no tear in his eyes for years. But last night, when I saw the movie, I cried like a baby. It felt like killing those people with my own bare hands.\n\nI could never watch porn again.\n\nCatch22 used to be my favorite book. Now I start hating it.",
