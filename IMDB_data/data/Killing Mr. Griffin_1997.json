        "reviewBody": "Mr. Griffin (Jay Thomas) is a bitter high-school teacher, who pushes his students to the limit and is hated by most of them. When he humiliates the popular student Mark Kinney (Scott Bairstow) is his class, Mark convinces his friends to play a prank on Mr. Griffin. The group manipulates Susan McConnell (Amy Jo Johnson), using her to attract the teacher to the parking area after hours. They kidnap, blindfold and take him to an abandoned boat house nearby a lake, and trying to frighten him, they leave him tied on a chair alone in the desert place without his heart pills. Mr. Griffin dies and when his body is found, the group panics.\n\n\"Killing Mr. Griffin\" is a very reasonable teen thriller. It is not a masterpiece or an awful movie, as written in many reviews, but a slightly above average story with a good moral lesson in the end. I believe the intention of the writer is to show the consequences of the steps each one of us decide to follow in life, no matter who the person is. The character of Mr. Griffin is very nasty and arrogant, being impossible to feel any sympathy for him. The Brazilian title is ridiculous, and the VHS released by \"Europa Filmes\" shows a picture of the body of Mr. Griffin in a grave with the students around, inducing the viewer that the genre of this movie would be horror. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"O Terror Ronda a Escola\" (\"The Terror Rounds the School\")",
