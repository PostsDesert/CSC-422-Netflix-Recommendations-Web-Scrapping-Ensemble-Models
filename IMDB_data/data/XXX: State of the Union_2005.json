        "reviewBody": "XXX: State Of The Union was a great action movie. I do not think it was as good as the first but still, very good. This movie was full of awesome action sequences. Some would say implausible but what action movie is realistic? I also kind of got the vibe that the producers of this movie were a bit mad at Vin Diesel but all that could be just part of the storyline, which I like. I guess the XXX will always be someone new, even more the opposite of James Bond.\n\nAugustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) seems to be the main recurring character. We learn a little bit about his past, his scarred face in particular. He chooses an old military acquaintance named Darius Stone (Ice Cube) as the new, badder and meaner XXX. This time, they have to stop an evil Secretary of Defense, Gen. George Octavius Deckert (Willem Dafoe) from having all those in the chain of command above him assassinated. As Stone says, \"the cleanest revolution in history\". I kept expecting The Green Goblin to emerge somewhere. I guess there is a similarity between his two characters.\n\nXXX boasts some of the greatest action scenes I have had the pleasure of seeing. The tank fight on the aircraft carrier was simply awesome. Sure, I understand this probably could not and will not ever come close to happening, but it is still fun to watch. No one in their right mind could argue that.\n\nI knew well ahead of time that many, many people would put this movie down, much of them without even seeing it. While I do think that it does not have the same rebellious feel as the first XXX, it was a great movie in it's own right. Highly recommended if you liked the first one. If you did not, then why are you bothering?"
