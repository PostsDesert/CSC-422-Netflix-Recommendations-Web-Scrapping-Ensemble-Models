        "reviewBody": "I managed to see this Lifetime movie dealing with teenage homosexuality. I am a huge fan of movies dealing with homosexuality but I think this movie painted an unrealistic picture of what many gay teens have to deal with. Unlike Jane's parents, most parents of gay kids will not attend PFLAG meetings, will not have friends that they know are gay, and will not stand side by side with their kids as they deal with their children's attraction for people of the same sex. In a way I think it devalues how tortuous it is for a kid dealing with a person's coming out process in their life when almost the majority of coming out experiences are downright bad. Still, it's hard to dislike Stockard Channing, and I think she did well under the circumstances that the script presented, and I think a film like this must be seen in the context of how television is just beginning to make movies that address homosexuality. In that way, I give this film credit for at least addressing some of the difficulties of coming out.",
