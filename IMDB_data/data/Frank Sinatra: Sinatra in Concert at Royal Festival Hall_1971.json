        "reviewBody": "Old Blue Eyes at the peak or perhaps on the descending side of the peak but nevertheless in great form. The orchestra lacks the punch and hard swing of the Count Basie or Nelson Riddle Orchestras but that doesn't prevent Frank from turning in some top notch performances. Particularly good are several chestnuts: \"Pennies from Heaven\", \"Lady is a Tramp\", and \"I've got you under my skin\" he falters slightly on George Harrison's \"Something\" but admits that he hasn't \"learned\" the song yet. Praise of the highest order from one musical titan to another. Things pick up again during the slow set with a tremendous performance art rendition of \"One for My Baby\"; but the triumph here is Sinatra's towering interpretation of Hoagie Charmichal's \"I get along without you very well\" so devastating that the director cuts to a shot of a man in the crowd wiping tears from his eyes as the song closes. For Sinatra fans and TRUE music fans this is a gem that must be seen.",
