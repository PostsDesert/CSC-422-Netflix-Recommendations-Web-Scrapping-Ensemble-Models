        "reviewBody": "This movie has been overlooked so much, it saddens me every time I see an empty review about it that fusses over tiny elements.\n\nYes, \"All Dogs\" is weird; There are dogs, orphans, corruption, murder, gambling, alcohol, afterlife, machine guns and a singing alligator, all mixed-up in the same movie. Yes, \"All Dogs\" has plot holes; Charlie can't talk to horses but can talk to alligators, the bad guy is allowed to enter heaven and the story is overall confusing.\n\nSo what?\n\nThis is one of the few movies that managed to make me \"feel\", in the true sense of the word. Have you ever been sad and hopeful at the same time? \"All Dogs\" made me feel that way. It makes me smile every time I watch it -without even knowing why-, and occasionally makes me cry. \"All Dogs\" has one of the most powerful endings I have ever seen in my life. The art is sublime; the characters' expressions, the backgrounds and special effects are astonishing. The symphonic and jazzy musics rolling in the background make whole with the 30's atmosphere. The dialogs are all fitting where they should belong. There are so many things to tell about this movie... I've noticed that many reviewers have been disturbed by the unusually dark tone spilled throughout the film. In real life, people are able to drink, gamble and/or kill. Don Bluth seems to be one of the few directors that takes children seriously, and present them the not-so-bright sides of life.\n\nFor those who are unsure about watching \"All Dogs\" or not because of some disturbing interpretations of the movie; Give it a try. You'll either hate it or love it to death, but one thing is sure: you won't be seeing anything like that in the near future. This is one of the strangely addicting movies that you love without knowing why (see also \"Six-String Samurai\" and \"The Man Who Saves The World\" to see what I mean)."
