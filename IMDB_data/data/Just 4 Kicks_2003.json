Is this really what 8 or 9 year-olds speak like?\n\nAnd what's up with this \"cheerleading\" aunt who can't seem to find proper clothing to wear? The soccer team is constantly gawking at her body.\n\nThis movie gets no marks from me. It tries to find humour through bad jokes and rude comments. Parenting magazine rated it as a good family film -- shame on them!"
