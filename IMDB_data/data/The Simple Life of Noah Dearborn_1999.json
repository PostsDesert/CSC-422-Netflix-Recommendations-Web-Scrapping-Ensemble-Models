        "reviewBody": "Ms.M. Louise-Parker and Mr. S. Poitier as well as the rest of the cast and crew did an excellent job in presenting this heartfelt story. A story that told the truth for so very many people in this country that will in no way have such a spectacular ending. Many times it is the children that take away their parents properties. They break the spirit of their loved ones in conjunction with land developers/or whom ever the interested party may be, and most often the victims are committed or die of a broken heart. It did not matter that Dearborn was so perfect, (Guess Whose Coming to Dinner?) most victims are not clean and healthy and strong. The powers that be were determined. In realty Louise-Parker would have been taken away never to be seen again. The performances of Dearborn made all of us feel much more than they presented to the viewers. This is writing and production at its finest with a happy upbeat ending white puppy and all. These are the movies that we as a people would have return to our screens. If not completely, then at least several times a year. At least they offer hope and faith...something that this planet is at this time so very short on. To The 'Simple Life of Noah Dearborn' we say thank you and BRAVO!!!!!!",
