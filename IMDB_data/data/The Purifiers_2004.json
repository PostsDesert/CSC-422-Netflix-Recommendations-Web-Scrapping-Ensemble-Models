It's movies like this that make me wonder how some people even began to think they could get anywhere in the business.\n\nThis is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Ever. The way this movie was directed has \"omg, I think I'm a freaking genius\" splotched all over it, but sadly, nobody but this lame director will agree with that.\n\nThe absolute *worst* part of this film is the editing. It's atrocious. Shots that should be longer are WAY too short, and shots that should be shorter are WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY too long. I mean... I'm seriously astonished here. What were they thinking? The second worst part of this film is the fighting - if you call it fighting. It's sad. Really. It will make you depressed.\n\nMan, and to think I wasted almost an hour and a half of my precious time on this. Reader, do yourself a favor and don't even go near this... This \"film\", as it claims to be.",
