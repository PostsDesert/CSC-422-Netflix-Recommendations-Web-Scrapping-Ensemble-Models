This is about poker, but more about how it affects life.\n\nMichael Imperioli plays the title character, a three-time World Series of Poker winner before his death at 42. This is how he rose to the top and fell back down just as fast.\n\nHe was an addicted gambler until he managed to win the World Series of Poker the first time. He protector (Michael Nouri) died soon after, but he managed to get his former girlfriend (Renee Faia) back with his winnings.\n\nBut it went downhill from there. He lost his wife and daughter, and just went to hell.\n\nSomehow he got it together to win a third time after a 16 year absence. But he went right back downhill.\n\nImperioli was fantastic, and Pat Morita was a bonus.",
