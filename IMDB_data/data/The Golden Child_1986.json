        "reviewBody": "\"The Golden Child\" is one of Eddie Murphy's most underrated films of the 80's but even though it's not well liked by many, well i have always loved it for the fun fantasy adventure it is & Eddie Murphy is still good fun here with his witty comedy.\n\nEddie Murphy, who is a hero of mine from growing up, here he plays a great role & play's it more straight & restrained, he's still funny but not overly energetic or crazy & i like his performance alot!!! He plays Detective Chandler Jarrell who specialises in missing children cases, discovers he's \"The Chosen One\" to help find a missing magical Tibetan Child who has great powers that can save the world from Evil, it's a totally fantastical Comedy adventure story with excellent pure 80's special effects & music & has a feel or vibe like the Classic \"Big Trouble in little China\" but not as great, & also stars two actors from that movie with Victor Wong & James Hong. The look & production design is excellent & some of the down town L.A scenes are actually very grimy & gritty, actually it's quite a dark movie with it's theme of child abduction & there's a very dark scene of a young girl found face down & dead in a grubby & gritty area of Los Angeles. Without the Fantasy & Magic side it would be a more Darker Noir Detective Thriller which in a way it really is!!! But that's also a plus point to this movie is it's basically set in the real dangerous world where these evil things do really happen but the Fantasy part helps to cope with it & gives a nice comforting feel that even the comedy legend Eddie Murphy has to come accross evil in the world. The demon monster villain at the end is Awesome & looks great still.\n\n\"The Golden Child\" is so 80's & so much fun & was Directed by Michael Ritchie who has done many excellent films such as Fletch (Chevy Chase) & Fletch Lives & The Couch Trip (Dan Aykroyd) & Cops & Robbersons (Chase), he knows great comedy.\n\nIt's a different type of role for Eddie Murphy & he's great in it. \"The Golden Child\" is very underrated & i can see why some didn't enjoy it because it's not the usual Murphy brand of antics, he's more serious & reserved in a way but definitely suits the movie because of it's dark atmosphere & as a kids family type fantasy Comedy it has some scary stuff in here.\n\nYes i have Nostalgia for this flick but it's a film i have always loved & enjoyed. I love most films that critics hate anyway!!! I love the 80\"s",
