        "name": "Arguably one of the worst Dragon Ball Z movies ever made",
        "reviewBody": "This is the fourth Dragon Ball Z movie released during the series Japanese TV run. A planetoid is averted by Goku and Krillin and later explodes and descending upon it is a band of sun-sensitive alien nomads led by an aging Super Namek named Slug, who uses the Dragon Balls to regain his youth and plans to terrafreeze Earth into a starship. Defending the planet are Goku, Krillin, Piccolo, and Gohan. This movie suffers from an extremely shallow and ill-conceived plot. It seems that this movie's screenwriter did this movie's story in a very hurried and half-hearted effort (which made a lot of sense, considering that by this point, Toei Animation called for 2 Dragon Ball Z movies to be released annually in March and July to be screened at Toei's annual anime fairs and in theaters). Nearly ever aspect of this movie looked like it was put together without much thought, including the villains, the plot, the animation (from time to time), and in many of the scenes such as how Slug is stopped. The plot often repeats elements found in the previous DBZ movie, Earth's Ultimate Deciding Battle a.k.a. The Tree Of Might. This DBZ movie, purely seen as a regular movie, is one of the worst. If you are a hardcore Dragon Ball Z fan, I'm sure you will find it at least watchable.\n\nGRADE: 1 out of 5 stars"
