        "reviewBody": "I disagree with the poster above. I thought this revival was a wonderfully imaginative and compelling show. Quite familiar with the original series, I was a bit skeptical when this premiered as to what could they do and how they would update. This revival takes the original story of Barnabas Collins and company which took a year of the daytime show and compacts it into 12 episodes. I have also read the \"Dark Shadows Companion\" book that they put out when this show originally aired and they were basically using the first season as a springboard to get into different stories. What I liked about this version is that they took the familiar story but added twists and turns not in the original to keep it fresh. Both purists of the original show and new fans will find this very faithful, right down to the creepy original music that Bob Cobert used on the daytime show. I gave the VHS set to a young friend of mine awhile ago and he immediately was captivated as well and he became interested in the original series, which is quite easy to get on DVD. The casting was remarkable because each actor put a great new spin on the material. I also liked the fact that they rolled in other plots from the daytime show to fit into the main plot of Barnabas, Victoria and Dr. Hoffman. I never thought they could replicate what everyone liked about the original series but they managed to do it. This is a great treat for new and old fans alike and a must for any serious collector. My only quibble with the DVD is that there are no extras and that they did not restore the original print, using what looks like an inferior transfer copy from VHS. Not to be missed for the standout performances of Ben Cross, Jim Fife, Joanna Going, Jean Simmons and Barbara Steele."
