If you love the man's music and hope to see a DVD in which the true concert experience is captured, this is your movie. I have been lucky enough to see Morrissey live twice and this DVD is almost as good. The performance is incredible and, the only reason I would rate a live performance as better is because the man himself is in the same room. very worth your money and time. The set list contains songs that not only reflect Morrissey's huge catalog, but also show off his incredible vocals. The band sounds great, as always. The crowd is enthusiastic and the videography is superb. A DVD that is a must in any true Morrissey fan's library. A+++++ all the way!",
