        "reviewBody": "For those of you who enjoy Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers music...you are guaranteed to enjoy this DVD. They do a run through all of the Last DJ songs and it features some older rock n' roll songs like \"Shake Rattle and Roll\" \"'round and 'round\" and some of Tom Petty's older songs \"Mary Jane's Last Dance\" \"You Wreck me\" \"I need to know\" and \"Change of Heart\" It's a throughly enjoyable musical experience for any Tom Petty fan. In my opinion it's a hallmark in Tom Petty history, as he is getting older and still manages to rock almost as hard as he used to. If not still as hard. The Heartbreakers prove once again that they know how to put on a show, and they know how to entertain. Check it out.",
