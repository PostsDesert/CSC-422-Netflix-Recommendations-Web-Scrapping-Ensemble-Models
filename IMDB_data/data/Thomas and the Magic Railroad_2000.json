        "reviewBody": "My brother used to love Thomas when he was younger, and he is 3 years younger than me. This movie came out when he was 5, and I saw it for the first time in years, and I wish I never did. It was a totally embarrassing experience. The first problem was that it was too americanised. Mara Wilson? Peter Fonda? Alec Baldwin? These are three really good actors, and they were completely wasted in this movie. Remember, Thomas is British, so the casting was clumsy. The script was terrible, full of too many clich√©s, and awful one-liners. There was an attempt to liven it up, but it was no use. The damage had already been done. The only other movie I can think of, that has a truly bad script, is \"Addams Family Reunion\". After seeing this, I have changed my mind about which deserves a Razzie for Worst Screenplay. This one bites the dust. Although there weren't many songs, the songs I heard were just ghastly. Just pop wannabes improvising a tune that didn't suit the film at all. Lastly, the story was totally uninspired, and almost all of it was about humans. Only a segment was about trains. This movie was a huge embarrassment for me. Avoid! 2/10. Bethany Cox",
