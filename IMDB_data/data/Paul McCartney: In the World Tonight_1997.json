The music is secondary to Paul letting everyone know how great he is and explaining how he makes his music. As Frank Zappa once said \"Shut up and play your guitar\" This DVD is good if you are looking for a documentary from a great artist. But if you want to see him perform, find another DVD of his live music. Some of the music is lip syncing and a little is him playing to a crowd. But most of the time he cuts in to let everyone know how he did what it is you are hearing."
