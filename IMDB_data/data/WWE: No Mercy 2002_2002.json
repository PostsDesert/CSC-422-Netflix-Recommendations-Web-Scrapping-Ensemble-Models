        "reviewBody": "The problem with the WWE is that of three things: 1) Vince McMahon's persistant approval of terrible storylines created by... 2)the writers, mainly the highly criticized head writer Brian Gewirtz, and... 3)the backstage politics mainly instituted by Triple H and the Undertaker.\n\nThese are reasons for falling ratings and sup-par Pay per views. This was a pay-per view that was pretty good considering the horrible necrophilia angle and the Brock Lesnar's mind games with Sara (which I believed bombed the first time with DDP back in June 2001). Triple H also not wanting to even lose a match let alone a title results into a predictable outcome of a possible classic matchup. The highlight of the night was, without a doubt, the Hell in the Cell. It was great but it became more serious and realistic after Undertaker began bleeding profusely. It became evident that he was hurt and cut severely. It was unfortunate that he was actually hurt but this match should make the top 10 list of best matches in 2002.",
