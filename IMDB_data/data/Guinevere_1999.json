        "reviewBody": "I suspect the theme of this movie is a relatively common fantasy among \"mature\" single men. Namely, find a very young woman who needs guidance and love, attach no strings, and plan on her leaving as she grows up. \"Guinivere\" is hard to watch in places, especially as the couple arrives in L.A. and it becomes crystal clear to her what her man really is all about. However, it is a well-done study of human needs and conflicts. And ultimately, resolutions. \n\nGuinivere's mother's analysis is spot-on, mature women just don't have \"awe\" of this dysfunctional photographer, and that's why he is always with a much younger woman.\n\nI gave this movie \"8\" of \"10\". Not because it is fun to watch, but because it does such a good job of exploring family relationships and individual growth.\n\nOct 2006 addition: Seeing part of it again today, I realized something which escaped me on first viewing. The first time he asks her to pick which of two photos is best, he was just setting up the rest of his ruse. He used it as a trick of sorts to make her believe she had a photographic talent."
