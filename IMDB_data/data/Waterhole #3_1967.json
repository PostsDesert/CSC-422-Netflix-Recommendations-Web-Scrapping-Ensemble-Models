It is a film full of scoundrels.\n\nSergeant Claude Akins has decided to quit the army in style when he and two others decide to rob an army gold shipment. One who buries it has a map drawn to find it. But he loses it and his life to gambler James Coburn who is one unique kind of rogue. \n\nSo is sheriff Carroll O'Connor who led a life of crime himself before taking the badge. In fact as sheriff upholding law and order he's brought a Tammany Hall/Chicago machine style to the job. He's also got an interesting set of morals after Coburn fleeing from him takes advantage of his daughter Margaret Blye.\n\nI won't even go into the plot and definitely won't go into who wound up with the gold. It has to be seen to be believed.\n\nScoundrels abound in Waterhole #3 along with many laughs.",
