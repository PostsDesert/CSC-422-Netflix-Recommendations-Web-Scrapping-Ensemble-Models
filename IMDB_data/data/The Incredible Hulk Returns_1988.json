Secondly, Bill Bixby (David Banner) really struck me as a great actor here, I am sure he was fine in the old show but I don't remember being so impressed with him like I was here.\n\nAnd thirdly, Thor is just a really fun character to have around, in fact the makers of today's superhero movies could learn a thing or two from this under-rated TV movie.\n\nIn a nutshell: this is a nice light hearted blast!"
