I'm sorry I didn't get to see it in the theater - the small screen didn't do it justice!\n\nI was about the same age in the 1972-1974 period as Betsy and Angela were, so I was just as interested in the pop culture references as I in the Watergate story. I sang along with the music, reminisced about the clothes, and laughed until I cried at the antics. 2 thumbs up!"
