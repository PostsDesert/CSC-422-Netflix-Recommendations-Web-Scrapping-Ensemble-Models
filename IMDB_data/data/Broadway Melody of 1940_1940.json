I have always known that Fred Astaire was the best but only recently did I discover Eleanor Powell, even though she was a star when I was a kid but kids don't enjoy musicals. Powell is the greatest and the best partner Astaire ever had. It is too bad they didn't make more movies together. \n\nThis is a movie I would recommend to anyone. It is one I can watch over and over again because the dancing is so fantastic. Even my grandchildren enjoyed this one. I would have given it a 10 but for the story but then every Astaire movie is a fantasy in dance but Powell makes this one a super fantasy.",
