This collection of clips from some of his earlier shows may be best suited to those who have spent at least some time in England (or don't mind not recognizing all of the guests), and are not too easily offended by casually raunchy material. I find him refreshing and so, so funny, but I wouldn't recommend him to, say, my parents. If you are American, you may want to watch the new compilation (also titled \"The Best of So Graham Norton\"), which will be easier to find in the US and promises to have more American guests (although I have not yet seen it myself).",
