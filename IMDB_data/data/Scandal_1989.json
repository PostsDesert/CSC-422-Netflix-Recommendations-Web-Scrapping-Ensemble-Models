        "reviewBody": "I didn't expect much out of this when I was saw it about 15 years ago, but it turned to be quite interesting. The only problem was it has too much a sleazy feel to it and an obvious political agenda, which is not unusual in films. The agenda is almost always one way.\n\nThere is a lot of nudity in here, lots of it mainly with Bridget Fonda who plays \"Mandy Rice-Davies\" and Joanne Whalley-Kilmer as \"Christine Keeler.\" Whalley-Kilmer looked particularly beautiful.\n\nJohn Hurt as \"Stephen Ward\" and Ian McKellen \"John Profumo\" are the males. The story is about Britain's \"Profumo Affar,\" as it was labeled back then - a sex scandal involving English politicians in the early 1960s.\n\nIn what could be a dry account turns out to be a fascinating movie, well-acted and beautifully-photographed. I've seen it three times and the third was probably the last. By then, the titillation of the nudity had worn off and the bias of yet another Liberal agenda bashing conservatives (it's same all over in the world of film-making) got a bit annoying. That, and the fact that had no English subtitles on the DVD, was disappointing.",
