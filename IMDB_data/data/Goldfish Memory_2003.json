Now Liz Gill tries to do her bit filming this story of crossed lives, heterosexuals that become homosexuals, lesbians who wants to have babies, the fear to commitment (or the need of a commitment).\n\n\"Goldfish Memory\" is a funny movie, tender and kind. Nothing too deep, and it's not pretentious at all either. There are some stereotypes, but that's normal. I guess Miss Gill achieved what she set out: to make us smile watching a group of men and women chasing love just like donkeys chase the carrots.\n\n*My rate: 7/10",
