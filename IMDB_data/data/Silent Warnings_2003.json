        "reviewBody": "After the accidental death of his cousin Joe Vossimer (Stephen Baldwin), the just-graduated electronic engineer Layne Vossimer (A.J. Buckley) joins his girlfriend and four friends of them to visit and clean the inherited farm in the country. The local Sheriff Bill Willingham (Billy Zane) is an old friend of Layne, and also grieves the death of Joe. When the group arrives in the farm, some weird and mysterious signs appear in the cornfield, but they believe the other locals are joking with them. When Iris Doyle (Kim Onasch) vanishes, the rest of the group realizes that there is a serious menace jeopardizing that place.\n\n\"Warnings\" is a ridiculous horror-sci-fi movie, a shameful ripoff of \"Signs\", inclusive using a location identical to Mel Gibson's farm. What else can I write about a movie where the participation of \"the great actor\" (of course I am being ironical) Stephen Baldwin is less than five minutes, only to give his name to the credits? I have just glanced some IMDb reviews, and their titles are enough to describe and comment this crap:\n\na) \"Stupid\";\n\nb) \"Awful\";\n\nc) \"WHAT A JOKE...,\";\n\nd) \"My God, Save Your Money!\";\n\ne) \"Garbage\";\n\nf) \"What a complete waste of time\";\n\ng) \"What a rip-off\";\n\nh) \"Total 'Signs' Rip-Off\".\n\nMy vote is three.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Aviso Mortal\" (\"Mortal Warning\")",
