Does any one know what size they are modeling the series at? As a Train enthusiast, they look 'O' gage to me, but not sure if they have a different system over there to determine train size. I would love to see them at some point run a contest to create a new character ya know a color, face, name type thing.\n\nAnd for those of you that got the season 1 DVD, How many episodes and what kind of bonus features came with it? I know I would like to see the sets they work with in terms of size alone because they must be HUGE!"
