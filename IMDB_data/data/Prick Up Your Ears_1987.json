        "reviewBody": "Although in some ways more theatrical/televisual than cinematic, this is one of the best British films of the 80's, and is probably Alan Bennett's most successful screenplay. Bennett and Orton have a number of things in common - a love of \"found\" dialogue (here mainly given to Orton's landlady) - theatrical success in the 60's (Bennett in \"Beyond the Fringe\") - and of course their sexuality.\n\nThe film is quite interesting in what it leaves out - anyone who has read Orton's diaries will know that \"the latter part\" is rather underplayed here. Also sadly missed is \"Mrs Edna Welthorpe\" an alter ego of Joe's who would write to newspapers denouncing his plays as filth - a rather cunning way of securing free advertising. A very interesting telephone conversation with Brian Epstein \"...one of the boys is happily married...\" plays with what we now know about Epstein and Lennon in a beautifully understated way.\n\nOrton and Halliwell's relationship is counterpointed in the film by \"John Lahr\"'s own marriage (Wallace Shawn is great here too, as always) as Lahr's researching of his biography acts as a framing device for Orton's story. As others have commented, the dynamic of the central relationship rings horribly true to anyone who has been in a halfway similar situation.\n\nIt's interesting to speculate on what would have become of Orton had he lived. Time has dimmed the shock value of his plays to the point where they will probably never have the same effect, and despite various rumours (the Sex Pistols?) no-one has picked up the Beatles script, probably for the same reason. Live fast, die young, leave a good looking corpse? Perhaps.",
