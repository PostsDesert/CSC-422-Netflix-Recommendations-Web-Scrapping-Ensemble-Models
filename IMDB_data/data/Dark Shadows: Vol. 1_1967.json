        "reviewBody": "When I sat down in 2021 to watch the \"Dark Whispers: Volume 1\", I had never even heard about the anthology. I liked the cover and found it interesting, thinking that there might be something enjoyable to this movie.\n\nBut it was a swing and a miss. \"Dark Whispers: Volume 1\" is listed as horror / thriller / drama. But there are a scary lack of horror and thriller throughout the course of this anthology. In fact, the anthology segments were of very varied worth, most of which were dubious at best. And yeah, that made for a very abysmal anthology.\n\nThere was nothing worthwhile to sit through in \"Dark Whispers: Volume 1\", so you might want to do yourself a favor and skip on this 2019 anthology, especially if you enjoy properly entertaining anthologies. And if you enjoy horror, like I do, then you most certainly want to skip on \"Dark Whispers: Volume 1\", because it was quite far away from being horror material actually.\n\nAnd while each of the segments were worlds apart, there weren't really any red thread throughout the anthology, aside from the narrative story segment that bound the individual stories together. Would have been more interesting if there was a common element to the segments.\n\n\"Dark Whispers: Volume 1\" was a massive swing and a miss. And it is definitely not something I would recommend you wasting your time, money or effort on. Some of us did, so you don't have to.\n\nMy rating of \"Dark Whispers: Volume 1\" settles on a mere three out of ten stars - and that is being rather generous, believe me. It is the production value of the anthology that ensured a rating of three stars from me.",
