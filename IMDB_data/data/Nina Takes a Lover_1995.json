        "reviewBody": "Laura San Giacomo has a husband who's always away on business and it makes her a sad person. She has a meet-obnoxious with photographer Paul Rhys and they start an affair.\n\nThis is a terrible movie. Nobody in it has any discernibly human traits, so none of the dialogue sounds like things that real people would say ... and it's all dialogue. Giacomo and Rhys prattle on endlessly in scene after scene after scene.\n\nFull disclosure: The film has a huge twist which caught me totally off-guard. In retrospect, it should have been obvious, but since little about the film made any sense, I assumed that the twist-related details that didn't add up were just part of all the other details that didn't add up. Anyway, the film manages to do nothing of any interest with the twist once it drops.\n\nNobody in the film is good, but I don't really blame them. At times it reminded me of \"The Room\", but with better actors and basically competent filmmaking. It's kind of a testament to Giacomo that she can do anything with this.\n\nMichael O'Keefe has a totally irrelevant part that involves sitting in a chair and nodding a lot. Fisher Stevens is about as miscast as it's possible to be as a studly barista.",
