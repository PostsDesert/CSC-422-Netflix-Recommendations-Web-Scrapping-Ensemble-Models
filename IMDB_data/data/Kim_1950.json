Stockwell was only fourteen (14) years of age when he starred in this film opposite the established big box office film star Errol Flynn but he certainly holds his own against the seasoned veteran actor(s).\n\nRespectful that the film was made seventy (70) years ago, this adventure film still is able to capture a viewers imagination which I attribute to the excellent scenery, desert landscapes and superb direction by Victor Saville.\n\nI have watched the film twice and I look forward to watching it again a third time, not because I don't have a life, but because this film depicts a youth's adventurous life which all young boys (and girls) dream of.\n\nI give the film Kim a pleasant IMDB rating of 7 out of 10.",
