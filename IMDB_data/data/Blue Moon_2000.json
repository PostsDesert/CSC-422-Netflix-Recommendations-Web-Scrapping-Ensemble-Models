        "reviewBody": "I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Firstly the picture quality was exquisite, even in the interior scenes and the protagonists were beautiful people. I really found Rita Moreno superb ! I just can't believe she's over 70 years old. I was originally attracted to the film because I thought it was about time travel - but in fact, it's more of a Romantic Fantasy, rather like a film I saw in England many years ago called ' You're the Cream in My Coffee\" ( and which I've never seen since) but which was, as far as I can remember, on the same kind of theme ( A couple reliving their youth ). Despite the slow pace of \"BLue Moon\", I just wasn't bored for one minute as the dialogue was so well done. The film may not appeal to lovers of action films but too much action finishes by blowing your brains out and this sort of film is just the thing to watch when your're relaxed and looking for a nice bit of romance and fantasy."
