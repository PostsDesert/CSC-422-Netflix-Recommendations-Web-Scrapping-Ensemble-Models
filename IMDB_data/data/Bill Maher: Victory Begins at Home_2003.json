        "reviewBody": "Released a mere couple months after President Bush declared that \"major combat operations in Iraq have ended\", Bill Maher brought his trademark (and well-placed) cynicism and poignancy to the stage. It was also intriguing in the presentation, aside from the stand-up material itself; at the time Maher had a book out with parodies of 40's and 50's public service posters warning people. These come up several times behind Maher, and they aren't distracting, they help to add to the points in his act. He talks about the War, Bush, sexuality, and what went down with the 2000 election- \"I (bleep) my wife\" was one of the more memorable bits. I don't remember the special as freshly as I do of Maher's recent I'm Swiss comedy special, but I do remember having as many laughs as with the latest one, maybe more so due to it not being as familiar (Maher had either just started or was going to start his 'Real Time' show, and most of the points made here are new for the time). But as an added bonus if you can get the film on DVD is extra footage of an off-beat, hilarious Q & A with Maher and the audience. Some of it really catches him off guard, which is ironic as he seems to always be on his feet with his attack on stage and on his shows.",
