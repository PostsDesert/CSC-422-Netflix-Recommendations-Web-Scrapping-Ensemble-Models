He runs a zoo with his wife Terry where he is as much of an attraction as the animals. He combines an outgoing and typically direct Aussie personality with a fearlessness that continually has me thinking, \"I don't believe he just did that\". One minute he's capturing a crocodile by jumping onto it's back with several of his \"mates\", the next he's picking up the third most venomous snake in the world BY THE TAIL. Add to that the rich \"Down Under\" slang and you have a unique show. Entertaining and funny while showing you things about wildlife you'd never see in a typical nature show."
