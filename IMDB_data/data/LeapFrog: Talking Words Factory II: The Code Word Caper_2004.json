In fact, it was actually painful to sit through the videos when I was little. The constant repetition was appropriate but the animation and boring plots were quite dreary. If you have insomnia I would highly recommend it. As a learning tool, don't bother. I find the Baby Einstein videos much more stimulating and appealing."
