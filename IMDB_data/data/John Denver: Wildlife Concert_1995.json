        "reviewBody": "An excellent John Denver concert, containing many recognizable favourites plus one selection apparently recorded nowhere else, \"For You\". John's voice is in fine form and he is backed up by skilled musicians, including James Burton on guitar. The Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation provides full, rich sound. The visual clarity is superb. A must have for any John Denver fan. It would be nice if this DVD was re-issued in Blu-Ray format. However, that is not likely to happen because of the fact that the concert was recorded in 1995. Nevertheless, this is a DVD that any John Denver fan would be happy to own.",
