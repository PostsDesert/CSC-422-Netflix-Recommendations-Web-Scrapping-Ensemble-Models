        "name": "A Brazilian version of 'Rear Window' but more human tenderness, brilliant delivery ever so subtle from the accomplished Fernanda Montenegro",
        "reviewBody": "Foreign film moviegoers who appreciated \"Central Station\" 1998 from director Walter Salles will definitely once again enjoy Fernanda Montenegro in another Brazilian gem, a small one, perhaps, nevertheless, \" Outro Lado Da Rua, O\" 2004 aka \"The Other Side of the Street\" from director Marcos Bernstein (who also wrote the story), is a worthy film for wider recognition.\n\nIt does remind one of Hitchcock's \"Rear Window,\" yet Regina, the heroine of the story in her sixties, energetically portrayed by Montenegro, is dutifully observing 'the other side of the street' through her binoculars vs. from the 'rear' of her building. And, this is not exactly a thriller, it's very much a human story: of two lonely people who needed to open up, reach out to touch someone and be touched. By circumstance or by fate, the human spirit at heart, quietly beckons to be rekindled. What's old age? Youthfulness is how comfortable you feel about yourself - let go of burdens and welcome - let love walk in.\n\nSounds 'corny,' maybe. So say one of Emily Dickinson's 'trimeter' epigrams: \"The heart wants what it wants - or else it does not care -\" Bernstein's story is sensitive, tender, witty, very much captures the predicaments of the two lead characters. And the music by Guilherme Bernstein Seixas accompanied the scenes well, as if the rhythm and musical notes understood the situation of these two: Regina and Camargo, the retired judge across the street, played wonderfully by Raul Cortez.\n\nI noticed cable Sundance Channel has aired this Brazilian gem several times already. It is available on DVD (1 hr. 38 min.) Check it out and quietly enjoy.",
