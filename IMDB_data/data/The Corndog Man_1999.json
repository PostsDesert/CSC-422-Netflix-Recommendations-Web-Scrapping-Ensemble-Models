        "reviewBody": "I just watched this gem on video and I immediately recognized the source of the story. About seven years ago I heard some crank call tapes that were circulating here in Florida. These calls victimized a southern car salesman and were made by some college students doing \"cracker\" type accents. The calls started out semi-legit but degenerate into total harassment just like the \"Red\" or \"Tube Bar Bastard\" calls. This film is worlds better than the \"Red\" movie because the director along with two other writers actually synthesize a feature length story(a little cliched- but good) around the premise and create a HILARIOUS movie. Noble Winningham really shines in this film and I give it TEN THUMBS UP, YOU WILL PISS IN YOUR PANTS FROM LAUGHING.(especially if you've heard those tapes)"
