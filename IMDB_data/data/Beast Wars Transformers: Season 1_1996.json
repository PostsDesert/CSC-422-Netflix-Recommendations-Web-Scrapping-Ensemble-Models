Three hundred years later, a new Megatron emerges to command new troops, the Predacons, to conquest. Using transwarp technology, Megatron and his soldiers travel through time to a familiar blue green planet with Optimus Primal and his Maximals in pursuit.\n\nThis well written series paid homage to the Generation One series, both the comic and the cartoon, and still managed to stand on its own. The characters grow and mature, cowards become heroes, villains prove their honor, and heroes die protecting the innocent.\n\nI grew up with Generation One, I love those characters, but Beast Wars was unquestionably the best written series that ever existed in the Transformers series."
