I have briefly enjoyed the introductions of some new characters and the Lawrence of Arabia homage episode, but the action is so boring. It feels like there's nothing at stake. The chase scene in the third episode was so terrible. I have not been so disappointed with Star Wars since Leia \"used the force\" to fly back into a ship.",
