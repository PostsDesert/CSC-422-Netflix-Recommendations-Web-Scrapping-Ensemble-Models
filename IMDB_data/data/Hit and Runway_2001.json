It is a \"story within a story/odd couple\" film. Though not entirely original, it does everything it sets out to do well and with great humor. Anyone who wears glasses, is Jewish, Italian, gay, writing a screenplay, looking for love, interested in how Hollywood works, and/or simply appreciates intelligent, off-beat comedy should enjoy this film. It has the sensibility of \"Ben Stiller meets Woody Allen.\" If any of this sounds good to you, see it.",
