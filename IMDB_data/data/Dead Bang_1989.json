        "reviewBody": "This movie plays like a typical good detective novel. Except for the hero every character is totally one dimensional and the well written story doesn't really deliver any big surprises. This being said, this film delivers decent acting, a compelling plot, and polished Hollywood production value. Frankenheimer definitely knows his way around the genre and he gets the most of Don Johnson's much-maligned acting chops by casting him in a role which perfectly suits Johnson's trademark 'maverick' cop character."
