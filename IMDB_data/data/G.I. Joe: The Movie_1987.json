        "reviewBody": "G. I. Joe the movie is a film that is good, if not perfect, as it is severely underrated. The plot is after their latest failure, Cobra finds some new allies in the civilization of Cobra-La, led by Golobulus, who is revealed to be the one who gave Doctor Mindbender the idea to create Serpentor, Cobra's current leader. However, the Joes also receive new recruits, one of them being Lt. Falcon, Duke's half-brother, who is also reckless, as it proves as he leaves his post to flirt with Jinx, resulting in Cobra initiating a prison break. Now the race is on to stop Cobra's latest plot to spread spores that will turn humanity into snakes.\n\nThis movie went through a troubled history. Announced first, it had plans to kill off Duke (whose action figure was being discontinued at the time). However, this would inspire Transformers: The Movie to kill off Optimus Prime, a move that caused so much controversy and outrage from fans and parents of kids who were traumatized by that scene, that Hasbro reversed the decision, and Sunbow were forced to rewrite the scene so Duke fell into a coma. Also, the poor box office performances of Transformers: The Movie and My Little Pony: The Movie (the original, not the one with Twilight Sparkle) resulted in G. I. Joe: The Movie skipping theaters and heading directly to video. Despite the edits to keep Duke alive, it is still a good movie, as it has a good story, voice cast (especially with the likes of professional wrestler Sgt. Slaughter, alongside the cast of the cartoon), and the action is excellent. My only gripe is the movie focuses too much on Falcon (whose is basically Hot Rod, only worst), and some of the plot points sound a bit corny (especially the reveal that Cobra-La was the ones who gave Mindbender the idea to create Serpentor).",
