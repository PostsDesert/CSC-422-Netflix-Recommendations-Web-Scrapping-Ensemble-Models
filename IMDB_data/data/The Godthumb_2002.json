It has the shooting, the orange peel, the horse head, and some aspect of the dialogue. Steve Odekerk does it again with this laugh-out-loud thumbation film thats always a delight to see. I would give this movie an 8/10. I know that seems high for such a low-budget movie, but this movie deserves every star. More people should see this movie, and enjoy it for what it is. The idea of putting faces on thumbs seemed really stupid to me before I watched \"The Godthumb\". This film is completely original, and works to potential. It had to spoof off of a film that is widely loved and admired, and anyone would have difficulty doing that. Steve Odekerk makes it look so easy, and pays respect to \"The Godfather\". This movie should be loved and admired by all movie-goers everywhere.",
