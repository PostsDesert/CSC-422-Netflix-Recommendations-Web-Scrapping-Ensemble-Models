This was definitely not a CBS Schoolbreak Special with Missy Crider and TV regular Bahni Turpin.\n\nOutside of these shower scenes was the cheesiest dialog that I have ever heard. I cannot believe this movie even had a script. I am sure the actresses were told just told use whatever cheesy prison dialog you can think of. It was painful to listen to. They threw in dialog about the Korean War and McCathyism to set the times, but it was just terrible.\n\nIt would have been a much better production if they had 80 minutes of shower scenes and 3 minutes of dialog, instead of the other way around.",
