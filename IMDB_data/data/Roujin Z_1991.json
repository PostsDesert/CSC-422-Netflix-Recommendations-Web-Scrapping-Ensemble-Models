Example: The movie takes place in Japan, with obvious visual references and talk about the beach at Kamakura, but the English dialogue also talks about various American things.\n\nThe film is basically a hilarious take on the robot gone insane story, where an experimental bed for elderly patients become simply a mental bed. The characters are especially enjoyable, including the old guys at the nursing home who often have a \"Grumpy Old Men\" style of insulting.",
