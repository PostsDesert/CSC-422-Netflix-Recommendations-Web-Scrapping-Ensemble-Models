As I would never watch a film without seeing the end I persevered to the end in the hope that it would have some answers, however, the ending is worse than the whole film put together. \n\nIt was extremely amateur and doesn't deserve to be on video or even TV. The sound and camera effects were silly and did nothing for the film neither. \n\nI'd give it 1/10 and that's being generous.",
