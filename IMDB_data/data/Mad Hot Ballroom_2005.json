They had so much courage. I commend them. I looked on the internet the next day and searched for a dance school for my friend and I and we're starting next week. I just hope we're as good as those kids. Excellent movie. All children should see this movie to show them that you don't have to have money to enjoy life. Most of these children were living at or below poverty level and they prevailed. They have more heart then most adults I know. I'm going to go see it again and I can't start advocating to others to see it as well.",
