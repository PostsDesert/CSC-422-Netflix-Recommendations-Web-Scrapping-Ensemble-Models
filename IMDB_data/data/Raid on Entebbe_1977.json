        "reviewBody": "Compared to its other US competitor, \"Victory at Entebbe\"(1976) this film displays higher production values and more attention to detail than \"Victory\" does. For instance, the Air France uniforms are much more realistic in this picture, whereas in the other production the costume designers resorted to just using U.S. Navy and Coast Guard shoulder boards. Also Idi Amin (Yaphet Kotto) gets a much better costume, much more realistic than the ridiculous getup Julius Harris had to wear in \"Victory at Entebbe\".I think the secret is that in doing this picture, and the definitive Israeli Golan-Globus work, \"Operation Thunderbolt\"(Mivtza Yonatan)(1977); the film makers were given much more time to prepare their production than ABC gave David L. Wolper in doing \"Victory at Entebbe\", which was shot on videotape like a soap opera, later transferred to film. It is an excellent lesson for film students that time spent on a project avails much. For this picture and \"Thunderbolt\" are much better films, even though in some respects \"Victory at Entebbe\" had more \"big names\" than \"Raid\" or \"Thunderbolt\". It seems all to be in the execution."
