Martin Lawrence tried his best, but he's made far better movies. \n\nAnd the time. This movie hardly lasted 90 minutes (which is actually a fortunate thing). Usually, movies that short have poor plots and little humor. This movie is no exception.\n\nThe idea is so silly. Jamal falls into a pond, trying to retrieve a necklace, and he appears in 14th century England? That sounds like a day dream to me. I guess it doesn't matter to Lawrence, who only wants to degrade people and show how much better he is than others.\n\nKevin",
