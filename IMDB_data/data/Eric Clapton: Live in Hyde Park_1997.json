The concert here must have been great to be at, and I completely enjoy the music on this DVD. However, there's very little point to watching it. It's just a video of him with his band, and the quality of the production seems to me to be sub par. So, I stick the DVD in the player and let it play while I do other things. For that purpose, I really enjoy this DVD.",
