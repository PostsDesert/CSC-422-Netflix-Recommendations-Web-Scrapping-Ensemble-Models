The cast is good including Amy Yasbeck as Mina and Leslie Nielsen as Dracula. Mel himself plays Van Helsing. Peter Macnicol is good too as Dracula's helper. Love the mock English accents and the way they pronounce \"Lucy\".\n\nIt's not as original as Young Frankenstein or as ribald as History of the World but it's got enough laughs. Surprised to find out it had bad reviews and wasn't a hit. Definitely worth a watch. I am a Mel Brooks fan and this one is about in the middle of the range.",
