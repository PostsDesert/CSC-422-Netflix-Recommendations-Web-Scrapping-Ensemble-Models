The theme and plot of this movie is timeless, it transcends eras and is as relevant today as it was in 1931! This is a \"must see\", I also recommend you find the time to watch the 1931 original, BOTH are excellent watches and well worth the time. I sometimes wish Holleywood would get back to movies like these, they are always worth the price of admission and are good for the heart. We can only hope! This will be a great movie to view with the whole family, just put on the pop corn, fill your glass with your favorite beverage and prepare to be completely entertained! Your children will remember this one!",
