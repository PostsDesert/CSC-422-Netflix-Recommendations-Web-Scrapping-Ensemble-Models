Then I watched it and I was amazed how good it was. The movie is about a small band with the name of kut u up touring with Blink 182, Green day and Jimmy eat world. Just to let you know Kut u up is a small band used to playing in small dance clubs and stuff. So the band goes on tour and the movie just gets funny and funny. If you like to laugh I recommend this. Also If you like any of those bands than this is your movie. Its worth it and everything. This movie is filled with humorous things and has awesome performances from all the bands I mentioned. So go see this if you like to laugh or play a instrument or dreamed of rocking out.",
