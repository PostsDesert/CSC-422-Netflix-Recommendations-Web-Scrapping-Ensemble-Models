        "reviewBody": "Amazing that this was written and directed by the guy who gave us the godawful \"Zombie Nightmare.\" It only goes to show that you CAN improve (although anything would be an improvement from that film).\n\n\"A Man in Uniform\" (the U.S. title, at least) is an incredibly well made film focusing on bank employee Henry Adler who is also trying to make it as an actor. The opening shot of a police officer getting blown away is amazing. It also serves to show how Adler (well-played by McCamus), gets the inspiration necessary for his audition as a cop on a \"Hill Street Blues\" type of police drama. Adler's personality is so vacant that when he asks to borrow the police officer's outfit so that he can \"stay in character\" he slowly becomes the cop he's portraying.\n\nA chilling urban psychodrama that deserves to be on the list with such films as \"Taxi Driver\", \"Falling Down\" and \"Death Wish\". 9/10.",
