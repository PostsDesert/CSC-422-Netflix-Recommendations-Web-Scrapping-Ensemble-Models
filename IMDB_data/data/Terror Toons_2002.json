The opening scene is fake, funny, stupid, horrible all at the same time. I find it funny how horrible this film is, yet it is very entertaining. The gore is alright, not all of it looks as fake as it does in the first scene, some of it looks okay. Most of the special effects are bad, but not all of it. Some very fake CGI in here, and the Terror Toons don't look like cartoons. The kills are okay, some of them funny, some of them just...bad. I still find it entertaining, I really enjoy this movie. Must see for any fans of really, really BAD movies!",
