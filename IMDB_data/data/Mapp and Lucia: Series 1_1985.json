Benson could never have figured that his \"Mapp & Lucia\" novels would have been so deliciously brought to life by Channel Four, in the television series by the same name.\n\nFor those who are especially aware of the stock 1920-30's characters (with a Mayfair edge, particularly), \"Mapp & Lucia\" is a treat. From the soignee social arbiter, the tweedy local matron, the all-too-effeminate best friend (petit-point tatting in hand), the ironing-board thin outre artist (a nod to Radcliffe Hall) to the supporting cast of local dwellers, \"Mapp & Lucia\" revels in its atmospheric production.\n\nWhen given the talents of Prunella Scales, Dame Geraldine McEwan and Sir Nigel Hawthorne, who play the title characters respectively (the latter, Georgino mio), it is little wonder that the shows transport one to the mignon village of Tilling, circa 1930. And the staging is so tongue-in-cheek, that certainly the Royal National would not have been ashamed to produce it. All in all, a curio of social manners set with more aplomb than \"You rang, m'lord?\" (1991) and more asperity than \"Jeeves and Wooster\" (1989) of the same ilk."
