        "reviewBody": "I saw this movie nearly twenty years ago now, and I'm still wishing that I had a copy.\n\nI'm not going to say much about the plot, because it's actually a very simple one. Two slightly older, slightly less than attractive people begin to have feelings for each other. Both have difficulties in social situations, and neither has a lot of experience with dating or with interacting with members of the opposite sex. The movie is kind of a duet of romantic motion: forward, backward, a mis-step, a detour away from the path to a relationship, treated with great sensitivity and affection for the main characters.\n\nI wish more people knew about this film. It was such a refreshing contrast to the usual formula of two gorgeous people eyeing each other across a room and instantly having an affair. Hollywood does what Hollywood does. Lonely Hearts shows us a slice of life.",
