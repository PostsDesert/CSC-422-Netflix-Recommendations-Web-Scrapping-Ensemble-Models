        "reviewBody": "This comedy/Western follow-up concerns about Terence Hill and Bud Spencer , two bandits half-brothers who attempt to rob a family but finish protecting them . They'll fight against shady baddies and corrupt landowners and will find shelter in a monastery where disguise themselves as friars. \n\nThe formula about ¨They call me Trinity¨ deals to enhance the comics remarks of the western/parody sub-genre originated on the 1960s decade with directors as Burt Kennedy and Andrew McLagen and adding the references to Spaghetti Western model that was in real decadence . The humor is continuous though sometimes grossed-out , laughters are based on physical differences and diverse personalities regarding both protagonists ; once upon terminated the Western formula is transfered to other genres as oriental adventures , policemen or action . The comedy is developed by means of successive struggles without blood , neither guts , nor cruel killings . The choreographic fights are slights and clean , no crude violence , nor gore , predominating the parody and irony . The film isn't always good , sometimes is fresh and diverting and on a couple of memorable occasions , it's frankly delicious . This fun , sympathetic movie is crammed of fist-fights , punches , kicks , knocks-outs , overwhelming stunt-work and lots of humor . Terence Hill plays as a rascal and likable gunslinger with fast-gun and Bud Spencer as a corpulent , grumpy and two-fisted hunk man but with good-heart , besides in the support cast appears the veteran Harry Carey Jr interpreting the daddy , he's regular of the maestro John Ford . This delightful spoof of the Spaghetti Western with our unlikely heroes achieved enough smash-hit , as well as the original film . And twenty and some years later was realized a third part : ¨The fight before Christmas¨ or ¨Troublemakers¨ but didn't obtain success and was a real flop . The 'Trinity and Bambino' times had passed and the 'Fagioli Western' sub-genre had deceased . Rating : Average but amusing and entertaining .",
