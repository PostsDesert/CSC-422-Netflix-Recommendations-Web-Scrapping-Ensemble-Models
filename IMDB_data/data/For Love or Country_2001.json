Fox is the concierge Doug Ireland and Gabrielle Anwar plays the woman he loves in Barry Sonnenfeld film For Love or Money (1993).The acting work is superb.The chemistry really works between the main stars.Fyvush Finkel is also great playing Milton Glickman.This is a nice comedy.It's not perfect but it's nice.Michael J. Fox is great in the lead.This isn't his best movie but he does a great job.This brilliant actor just received a star on Hollywood Walk of Fame.It was just about time.Fox retired from acting in 2000 because of Parkinson's disease but I surely hope he will recover someday and return to acting. But before that enjoy his working in movies like For Love or Money."
