        "reviewBody": "This a really amazing look at the intertwined lives in this conflict. The film explores the attitudes of those trapped in this struggle, the day-to-day issues of living in a war zone and the hopes for the future that some still have after all of this. The filmmaker manages to cast a fairly objective view of what's happening in Gaza. The film is amazing in that the camera gets into places one could never imagine possible. A truly noble pursuit. The fact that the director lost his life creating this necessary work is a testament to the dedication of himself and his partner. Placing a very human face on this struggle is mesmerizing; the shots of the militants interacting with children, the people who's homes were destroyed by tanks, really helps one understand the chaos of the situation on the ground there.",
