However, it makes use of girls with a special power called Virgin Energy, and no it still isnt a Hentai even if it sounds like it. It is sett in Yokohama in japan, during a war between japan and some undefined countries. I suspect on of the undefined countries to be Russia (see teh movie, you understand), and there is this special naval accadamy for girls with this Virgin Energy. The main character just wants graduate the accadamy so she can get married wit the ultimate proof of her purity. Things change and... welll I'm not gonna spoil it for you so go rent it or something. It is worth it, if you like Anime.\n\nNow normally, this movie would be seen as generaly ridiculus by annyone above tha age of 13-14 years. But the whole OAV becomes quite funny becasue of theis so called virgin energy, if you are older (like I am. 20 year old male) you just cant stopp laughing because of all the sexist comments and undertone of the 3 part miniseries.",
