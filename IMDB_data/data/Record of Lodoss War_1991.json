In comes Parn, a would be knight determined to prove his valor and restore honor to the family name, and his companions: the elf babe Deedlit (voiced in the English dub by Lisa Ortiz, who later went on to voice Lina Inverse in the \"Slayers\" anime), cranky dwarf Ghim, King Kashu, berserker Orson, and other assorted heroes and villains who are out to survive the war. \n\nAs others have undoubtedly said, this is a sprawling epic that holds no punches in trying to suck you in and make you feel like you're a part of this world and everything going on in it. The popularity and skill of this thing is reminiscent of \"Lord of the Rings\". Parn himself is a bit too dense at times (he never seems to figure out that you can't attack a sorcerer or sorceress head on) but he's okay. Deedlit is both funny and cool though her full potential is never tapped. It's fun nevertheless to watch her lust for Parn while he doesn't seem to notice, at least not for a while.\n\nOne of the most potent characters though is Ashram, an honorable soldier who fights on the wrong side of the war. See it just for him, if you like."
