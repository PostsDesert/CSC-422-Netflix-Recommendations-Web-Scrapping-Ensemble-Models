The children have adventures, good and bad, and learn some life lessons. Very family friendly, but good for all ages. Richard attenborough (TWO oscars for ghandi!) plays the kind, old gentleman. An interesting note... jenny agutter, who plays mother in the 2000 version, had played the daughter roberta in the 1970 version AND the miniseries in 1968. And even back in 1968, agutter had already been in the biz for four years! Directed by catherine morshead. It's cute. Novel by edith nesbit, who had so many works made into television and film. Although she died in 1924. Interesting info about her in wikipedia dot org and her bio page.",
