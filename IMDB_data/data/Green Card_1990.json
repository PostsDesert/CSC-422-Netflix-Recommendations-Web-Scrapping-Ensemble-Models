        "reviewBody": "This movie is strangely addictive. Gérard Depardieu displays a very noble and charming character who is at the same time a simple and gruff man. He doesn't do the pretentiousness that is so common today. He is unsophisticated yet not uncomplicated. Andie MacDowell plays her part wonderfully. You just want to smack her silly at times, which proves that McDowell is a great actress. She is also one of Hollywood's \"Classic\" beauties. She is a pleasure to watch not only for her first rate acting but also because she is such a handsome woman.\n\nMy wife hooked me on this movie. I am a typical American man, who is usuually into action and SciFi movies. I usually run screaming from romantic movies. The fact that this is a Romantic COMEDY made it fun to watch. Depardieu plays the large \"oafish\" commoner to a \"T\". He is a very funny man indeed, as well as a first rate actor in his own right. He is not in enough movies, IMNSHO.\n\nI wish the studio that owns this would release it on DVD in the US."
