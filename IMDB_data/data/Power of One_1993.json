It is probably one of the worst things I have seen in decades, fragmented storyline, completely ridiculous premise and the acting is some of the most painful I've seen. \"power of 1\" gets a 1 rating, ONLY because IMDB does not have a zero rating or -1. Also that finger in the air symbol is a gang sing for a handgun, nice image to put on a movie poster. Don't waste your time with this.",
