        "reviewBody": "This has an interesting premise, but those who made it couldn't take it seriously. Gene Wilder does his usual shy, reserved, should-I-or-shouldn't-I cutey. He and his juvenile muchachos act like children. He becomes obsessed with a woman in red whom he sees dancing over a heat grate. The movie is more about his mid life crisis (same old stuff) and how he maintains his status among these guys. He has the attractive wife, the adorable kids, and finds himself escaping an inevitable crash. It just doesn't work. Given a serious treatment and Wilder's acting ability, it could have been fairly nice. We are left to sort things out and hope for the best.",
