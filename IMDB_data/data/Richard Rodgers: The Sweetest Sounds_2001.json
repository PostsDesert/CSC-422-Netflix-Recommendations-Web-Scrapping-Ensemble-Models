It contains extraordinary archival footage and priceless interviews. The whole is very well put together and really gives you a sense of the personal struggles and monumental achievements of Rodgers and his colleagues Hart and Hammerstein. It is both beautiful and heartbreaking. It's also a tribute to persistence, hard work, and the nature and importance of \"good luck\". (I think my favorite part of the movie is the vignette of Rodgers and Hart bemoaning their lack of traction early in their career.)\n\nThis is a love story to Rodgers, to America, and to the American musical theater as an art form. If you have any interest in musical theater, it is a \"must-see\".",
