        "reviewBody": "Barbet Schroeder doesn't fare well in this directorial attempt. \"Desperate Measures\" is a film that has been seen in other forms before, better made. The screen play by David Klass doesn't make sense at all.\n\nWith that out of the way, this hospital thriller is fun to watch because of the intensity of both lead men performances. Michael Keaton, the bad guy in this film, shows an evil side not found in any of his performances before. He is equally matched by Andy Garcia, not one of our favorite actors. Mr. Garcia tends to shout and get incomprehensible at the most dramatic moments.\n\nThe last sequences of the film pack a lot of action, and once we have settled back to accept the silliness of the whole thing, we go for the ride. The chase and bridge scenes are staged well; they'll keep the viewer glued to the screen.\n\nWatch Michael Keaton as we haven't seen him before.",
