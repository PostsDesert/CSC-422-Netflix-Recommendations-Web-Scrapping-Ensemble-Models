        "reviewBody": "One of the biggest hits of 1992, the original WAYNE'S WORLD is a definite classic and is one of the funniest movies of 1990's, but I am not a big fan of sequels so I tried to avoid watching WAYNE'S WORLD 2 for a while. Eventually, I finally got around to watching WAYNE'S WORLD 2 and found it to be surprisingly better than the original. Part of the reason the movie succeeds is because it has one of the greatest casts in movie history with appearances by Christopher Walken, Heather Locklear, Bob Odenkirk, Robert Smigel, Kevin Pollak, Kim Basinger, Chris Farley, Drew Barrymore, Ted McGinley, Tim Meadows, Jay Leno, Charlton Heston, Ed O'Neill, and Aerosmith. I'm not saying that a good cast automatically makes a movie great, but in this case, it certainly helps. \n\nThe gags in WAYNE'S WORLD 2 are definitely more random and bizarre than the ones in the original, making it even more fun than I expected it to be. Some of these random jokes don't work as well as they should, though overall it's still a hilarious movie that is good to watch with your friends. ***1/2"
