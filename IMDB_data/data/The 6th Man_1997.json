Kadeem Hardison and Marlon are just as convincing as brothers as Marlon is with his real life brother Shawn on \"The Wayans Bros.\" The acting was great, the comedy was great, and the writing was great. This is the film that made me look at Marlon Wayans as more than just a funny guy, but also as a very talented actor. I give this movie a 10."
