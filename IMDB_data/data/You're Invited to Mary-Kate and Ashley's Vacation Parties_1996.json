This video gives a great message, telling you to follow your dreams. The scene that really spoke to me was the pizza song. MAN, did that pizza look absolutely delicious! I'll never forget this one time, a bunch of me and my gal pals decided to make a pizza of everything in the song. I'll admit, we didn't include everything. We left out the salsa..Salsa on pizza? Now that's atrocious! So anyway, me and my girls put everything on the pizza, and it was the best thing I've ever tasted! Now every time I order a pizza, I make sure to add all of those ingredients! Yum! The one part that really terrified me was the scary movie song. I always had to fast-forward through that part, otherwise I would get nightmares. I still fast-forward it to this day! I don't think they realized how scary that part would be for children and young adults. I recommend this movie to everyone, especially those locked up in a retirement home. Just make sure you have the fast-forward button handy!",
