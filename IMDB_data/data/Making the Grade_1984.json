Judd Nelson is hot, but the flick is poorly directed and the sound is pretty bad. The characters are foolish at times- how is it Eddie goes from being ok with who he is to being a snob in about three scenes? I don't know. Cheesy? Most definitely. However, 80s teen movies are 80s teen movies. If you like them, see this, but don't expect one of the caliber of TBC."
