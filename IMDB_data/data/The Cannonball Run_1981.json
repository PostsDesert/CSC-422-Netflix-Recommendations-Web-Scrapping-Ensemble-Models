At the beginning of the race all of the competitors punched in their start time and took off one at a time. At the end Captain Chaos and Adrienne Barbeau have a footrace to the finish to punch in their times. The only problem is that Adrienne punched in at the beginning of the race at least 2 minutes before Dom Delouise and Burt Reynolds did. Chaos still had at least 2 minutes to punch in at the end and still win the race.... Also while the crowd is joking around at the finish line 3 cars pull up and screech to a halt; Jackie Chan's car, a taxi and Roger Moore's car. But Moore was standing in the crowd joking around. Who drove up in his car?"
