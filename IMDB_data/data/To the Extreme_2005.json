Pretentious, scriptless, unbearably slow and meaningless, this is yet again a story of a hesitating man torn between being what he is, gay and the love for his girlfriend. A drama shot in an apartment among Parisian petit bourgeois. The story never really takes off. The film is a collection of preposterous dramatic sequences, filmed with attitude posing for talent. As boring as it gets. A disappointment even for fans of Gay cinema. The cast is quite good with early performances of up and coming Julie Depardieu and Aureline Wiik. Both of them cannot do much to save such a bad script."
