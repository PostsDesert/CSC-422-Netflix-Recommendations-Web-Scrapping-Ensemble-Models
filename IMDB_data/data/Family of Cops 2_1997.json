        "reviewBody": "This is a really good Thriller & yes IT'S a t.v movie but hey if it's good it's good don't matter what the budget!!!\n\nBronson is a legend.\n\nFamily Of Cops is a well made Cop Thriller with that nice cop thriller musical score that alot of t.v detective films have & works lovely here,The Legendary Charles Bronson is excellent here as Paul Fien an old school tough detective who is put in a tough situation when his Daughter is framed for murder. Angela Featherstone (One Way Out) plays Bronson's troubled daughter & she's a fine actress & we get Leslie Ann-Down (Death Wish 5: Face of Death) who gets mixed up in the murder investigation. A fine supporting cast to surround the legendary Bronson as he plays Veteran Homicide Detective Paul Fein, another fine performance by Charles.\n\nBronson really gives a great performance & infact this is one of his finest performances of his career!!! Paul Fien is also one of his best characters ever stands right next to the vigilante Paul Kersey from the Death Wish franchise.\n\nOlder & wiser & very comfortable in this role & Bronson outshines everyone else in the cast & the cast are all good especially Daniel Baldwin (John Carpenter's Vampires) one of pauls son's whose also a cop, there is alot of Family drama going on in this story & murder & mystery & a great lead in Bronson so although a t.v flick it's actually more than that to me it's one of his best movies!!! I love the Character Paul Fien he's an old school cop with morals & the guy you want backing you up in the line of duty.\n\nI'm a huge Bronson fan & i love the Death Wish franchise & this little cop thriller is one of my fave Bronson flicks as it has such a nice pace & a nice atmosphere to it a good film to watch late at night.\n\nThe 2nd family of cops film was also very good but part 3 wasn't very good & some of the characters are played by different actors & that always ruins it for me but this first film is excellent & part 2 is very good so that's good enough Bronson entertainment for me.",
