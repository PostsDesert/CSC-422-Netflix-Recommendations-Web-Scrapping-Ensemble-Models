        "reviewBody": "It's funny, but the recent Criterion DVD release of \"The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum\" gives it a whole new perspective. Next to \"The Legend of Rita\", \"Lost Honor\" is almost like \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead\". But in this case, it's dead serious.\n\nKatharina Blum is a normal German woman who has a one-night state with a man she meets at a party. Later, she finds out that he is an anarchist and part of a Baader-Meinhoff-type gang; the group Rita from \"Legend of Rita\" is supposed to be a member of.\n\nResponding to the activities of German urban guerrillas, there is a national dragnet to hunt them down. Blum is arrested and gets caught up in the hunt, revealing a myopic government at it's most abusive. Equally revealing is the insidious nature of the media and it's role in repression. You can't help but get a chill watching it not because you can't believe it ever happened. But because you can't believe it happens all the time. Life in America is a lot like Katharina Blum's for many people.\n\nSchlöndorff is an intellectual. Both of these films are great reflections of that. They're smart, challenging while being well paced and lithe. \"Lost Honor\" marked the directorial debut of Margarethe Von Trotta (in some ways a protégé of Schlöndorff's not to mention lover) who would go on to great things including \"Rosa Luxembourg\".",
