        "reviewBody": "While I like \"The Brood\" quite a bit, Dead Ringers gets my vote as Cronenberg's best work. \n\nFollow along as the twin brothers spiral out of control when they unsuccessfully try to break free from each other. One's more confident, the other more timid. But they depend on each other, and at middle age neither has the psychological strength to be their own person; they still don't have a sense of self. Among many favorite moments, I love the scene where Elliott, the more confident twin, tries to kiss Claire. It's his way of trying to synchronize himself with his brother Beverly, whom Claire has a true connection with. \"I'm sorry but I can't\", she intones. Elliott turns to the mirror, disturbed. \"Am I really that different from my brother?\". He absolutely does not know who he is. \n\nAlthough it's not without some humor, Dead Ringers is very bleak. It has an emotional intensity that most movies can't touch. It is sad AND beautiful.\n\nThe movie itself *looks* great. Good script, and AWESOME performances from both Irons and Bujold. As another reviewer suggested, watch it twice if you don't like it the first time- it might grow on you. \n\nThis is my all-time favorite movie.",
