        "reviewBody": "Horton Foote has often written incisive character studies that are dramatically underpowered, and this effort by his writer-director son follows in Dad's footsteps. The very model of a small, well-meaning, late-1990s independent movie with no major stars (the biggest, third-billed Margaret Cho, has about five minutes of screen time), it's a little-people-about-their-tasks slice-of-life drama where the good guys mess up, clean up, mess up, clean up, and commit some business errors that seem improbably naive. Cameron Dye has a nice Aidan Quinn soulfulness and Kevin Geer is quietly excellent, but they haven't much to play. As another poster mentioned, it's unconvincingly telescoped -- does all the action take place within a year, with the tavern trying so many formats and suffering so many twists of fate? Also, for what it's worth, where would the \"Tavern on Main\" be? It's a New York-set film with some authentic-looking locations (and others that smack of Toronto), but the only Main Street in the five boroughs is in Flushing, and these bar patrons are definitely not East Queens stock.",
