She left their abusive father (played by Aidan Quinn), now ailing, for a rock star (Kevin Bacon, thirty seconds worth), with whom she has another daughter. None of the kids like her. Sedgwick smokes a lot, and sits around looking despondent. There are lots of close-ups of her driving, and reflecting on the past, feeling sorry for herself. And, numerous shots of sunsets. But, Cholodenko never decides what to do with any of it. There's no real direction, here -- just a series of depressing moments, with no hope in sight. \n\nWhat a friggin' drag."
