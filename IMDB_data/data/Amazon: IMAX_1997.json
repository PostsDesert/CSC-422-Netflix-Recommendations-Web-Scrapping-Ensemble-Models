However, footage of this pilot can be viewed on the episode \"Lifeblood\" in the fifth season of Xena. \"Lifeblood\" had a rather weak storyline at best, but it did provide justification for clips of the Amazon High pilot. Selma Blair does a great job as Cyane, a girl brought into the past from modern times to lead the soon-to-be-called Amazons. Karl Urban and Danielle Cormack also give the pilot life with good performances. There are silly moments (the Amazons dancing the Macarena for example), but overall, it definately might have had a future as a series."
