The second one had worst acting in it too. Air Bud three was totally stupid, and a waste of time, and money.\n\nI cannot believe they came out with an Air Bud 4! how in the heck can a dog hit a baseball with a bat!? How does the dog even know the rules of baseball, and the first owner in the first movie the \"Clown\" only taught him basketball! not all these other sports, and they had to just get Josh out of the picture somehow!\n\nSo that means the dog is at least 13 years old in this movie, if the first movie the younger sister was a baby, and now going into jr. high! Give me a break! Not even a toddler would like this!\n\nThe people of air bud has gone far enough, and now they are probably going to go out with more, to do ALL the sports.\n\n All in all, don't waste you money, nor your time watching this movie!"
