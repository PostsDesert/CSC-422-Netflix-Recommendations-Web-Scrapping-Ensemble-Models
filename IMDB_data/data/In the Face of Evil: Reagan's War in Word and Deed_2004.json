The things Reagan fought hard to defeat once again has raised its ugly head. This covers the basics of these two subjects in a light format. \n\nThe premise is to show how things slowly grew over years culminating to a near climax. A one-world communist nation is still on the agenda list. Today the word communism is softer, gentler term (defined by those that want this madness).\n\nYou have to understand and learn from the past or be destined to repeat it in either the same manner or a different but similar fashion.\n\nThe composition of the film has truth wrapped all around it.",
