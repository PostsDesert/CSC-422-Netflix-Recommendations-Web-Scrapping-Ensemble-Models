        "reviewBody": "A bit silly in parts with much of the acting and drama turned up to an excessive frequency. The style of this flick is quite cool, but then is belied by the unstylish plot and dialogue where the motivations of most actors just don't match up with their actions. One problem was a lack of gravitas given to events - out of place music and lengthy shots of no consequence. However the major problem for me was the main villain and protagonist played by Vincent Ventresca. This was a guy who was presented as gangster, powerful, and the head of a record company - yet his entire livelihood depends on a new mall? Seriously, a mall? Why is he interested in malls, where is the money for building the mall coming from, surely even if the mall is approved it will take years to get any return on investment etc etc. So the main plot device is nonsensical and the rest does little to make up for it. Perhaps if this were a blue movie all of the above may make some sense.",
