This film was so great, I had to get this for my collection,and I did. I really did like it after I bought it, and it was just like watching it again, on the Action Channel. I really do like Emeraldes, and I also liked her ship. What this anime tells us that life can be hard, and can also be an adventure. We all have to work hard, so we can achieve that goal, and we also have friends to watch our back. I do think that this is one of the best motion pictures to see. So in closing, if you have seen it on Action,then this is the one. You will see what I mean.",
