        "reviewBody": "This movie reeks of ineptitude. The only attraction is Rebecca de Mornay, who at least looks good. So what. \n\nThe romance is witless, the baseball scenes are trite. Even the putrid 2003 Detroit Kittens, the worst baseball team since the 1962 Mets, do better. It has no credibility as a romance. The jests aren't funny.\n\nThis movie will probably end up on the budget rack in some discount superstores because those stores have been cutting deals with movie companies to pump out as many movies as possible to sell for $6 or $7 as impulse items. Even for free it's no bargain; you have better uses of your time than this. \n\nIf you are collecting DVD's, then remember this basic rule: you are better off with one \"Casablanca\", \"Lawrence of Arabia\", or \"Wizard of Oz\" than with four bad movies. Indeed you are better off with one great movie than with fifty bad movies. A bad CD is at worst background music that you don't have to pay much attention to; a bad DVD will disgust you.\n\nI rate this \"3 of 10\" because the only harm that this movie will do to you is waste your money and take up space better suited to some other purpose, such as getting a really good movie. I save the \"1\" or \"2\" for something completely devoid of production values, grossly objectionable, or a failure at its purpose.",
