Every time I watch it, I pick up on more things -- like the way John Cusack's eyebrows lift when he meets Jennifer Tilly, who plays the floozy would-be actress, for the first time. Also, very interesting camera work from Woody; at times, the camera would find a position and just hold, as if we the audience were just standing there watching the scene unfold on a stage. Excellent acting all around as well, particularly Cusack, Tilly, Dianne Wiest and Chazz Palmintieri."
