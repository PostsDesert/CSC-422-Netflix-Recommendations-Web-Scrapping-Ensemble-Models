        "reviewBody": "I've often heard comments about how much anime \"rips-off\" other sources, usually blatantly. I can often see influences of other movies and tales in anime, but rarely is it such that the anime loses its soul... ...but then I saw Armitage III and understood.\n\nGranted, I saw (1) the compiled \"movie\" version, and (2) the English dub version (neither qualities that I enjoy in my anime), but Armitage is just a rip-off of Blade Runner, and not a very good one at that.\n\nI wasn't that thrilled with the animation- it reminded me of American \"serious\" animation, rather than anime; the voice-acting is bad, too; Elizabeth Berkeley is the saving grace (!) of the whole thing, providing a nice distraction from Kiefer Sutherland's wooden dialogue. As Armitage, she is tough, vulnerable, sexy, and naive at the same time. Kief is like one of the voice actors for the English-dialogue version of Megazone 23 part II... emotionless, and sounds like an automatic reading machine. Bleah.\n\nNot recommended."
