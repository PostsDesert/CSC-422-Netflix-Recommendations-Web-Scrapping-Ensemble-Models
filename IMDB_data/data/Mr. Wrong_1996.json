        "reviewBody": "My girlfriend told me to tape this from TV and I had no idea what it was about. Initially I was pleasantly surprised by seeing Bill Pullman in a lead role. The last movie I saw featuring him was \"While You Were Sleeping\" which I thought was great.\n\nMr. Wrong starts out reasonably good, but fairly quickly the stupidness becomes too much. Ultimately, it is made bearable by good acting from Degeneres and Pullman and a lot of funny moments. The moments in-between was unfortunately not just boring or neutral but plainly painful. This is obvious from the start when Martha Alstons (Degeneres) secretary brays on about receiving flowers from her boyfriend on valentine's day and Martha returns it in a totally non-funny way. I guess it could have been funny, but it was just painful to watch. Repeat ad nauseum with some genuinely funny moments in-between and you have this movie. In conclusion, its watchable and good for a few laughs, but if there's something more interesting available, just steer clear.",
