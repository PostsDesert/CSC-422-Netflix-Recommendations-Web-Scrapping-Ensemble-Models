To avoid spoilers I will not specify similarities, but invite you to take a look and think for yourself whether you agree or disagree with me. \n\nI liked \"Holy Land\" (8/10). Pace is generally good. It is slow in comparison with action, but, well, it is not action. Director is not insulting intelligence of viewers by explaining things too much, and I believe there are certain things (like true feelings of Sasha, for example) that you can only guess. Story grows like a tree, not telephone pole, with many branches going nowhere, adding credibility (Hints of Mike's life and current business, for example).\n\nFinally, I want to notice, that movie set in Israel.",
