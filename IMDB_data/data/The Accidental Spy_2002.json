        "reviewBody": "That unfairly never made it to the Cinemas (well in the UK anyway) probably because most of the dialogue is dubbed into English. There is more than enough action, with countless breathtaking stunts (Mainly performed by Chan himself) The bad Guys though are very much underused - so you never really feel Jackie's life is in danger. Otherwise a very good Chan Movie that's a must watch for his fans\n\nMy rating 8/10"
