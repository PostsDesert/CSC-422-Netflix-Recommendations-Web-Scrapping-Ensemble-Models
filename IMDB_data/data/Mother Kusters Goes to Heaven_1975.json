Mrs. Kusters wants to add canned sausages to the stew, her annoying daughter-in-law thinks otherwise. The point, we soon find out, is moot: Mr. Kusters has murdered the personnel director at the soap factory where he works before committing suicide.\n\nThe film drew on both Douglas Sirk's melodramas and Weimar era workers' films to tell a political coming of age story. Fassbinder also clearly criticizes the small German Communist Party's moderation and \"armchair activism\". Now, I know nothing about the German Communist Party of the 1970s, but I do know Sirk and Fassbinder's borrowing. This film is one of the most obvious Sirk nods I have seen yet. And, therefore, one of the better Fassbinder films.",
