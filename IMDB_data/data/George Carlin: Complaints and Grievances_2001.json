His topics include the September 11 attack (and his solution for the war), stuff from body parts, people he don't like who deserve to be tortured (including singers with one name and people who purchase small items with credit cards), and the Ten Commandments. Every now and then he threw in some of his old jokes (\"I'm going upstairs to f--- your grandma.\"). If you're a big George Carlin fan and have HBO, then sit back and get ready to laugh. My evaluation: A",
