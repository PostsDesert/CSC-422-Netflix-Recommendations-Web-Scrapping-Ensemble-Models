Well there's something you don't get everyday, man. Why did they put someone like that in? Someone who is like Carrie, please, Jason does typical murders, while she figures out how to control her powers, and tries to find out who is this Jsaon person. And the way she fights him is kind of pathetic, she just throws stuff at him and rips off his mask, can't she do something better, like smash him or send him flying to space? But then again that would be too weird, and it wasn't that exciting either. But I'll stop there. It did have everything else you'd expect in a slasher film, but I wish they could have done something else instead of a telekinetic person. Watch it if you're into it, or if you would still watch it even though it's like that.",
