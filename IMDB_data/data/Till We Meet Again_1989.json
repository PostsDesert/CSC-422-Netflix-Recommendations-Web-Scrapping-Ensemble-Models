        "reviewBody": "The saga of the French family de Lancel, since 1910 until the end of the Second World War, is not a bad movie. The video released in Brazil has two and half hours runtime, and the story has all the ingredients of a soap-opera: love, hate, betrayal, rape, war, death, birth etc. There are too much characters, and they are reasonably well developed in a shallow way. Michael York and Hugh Grant, with their strong British accent, are hard to be accepted as French. But Courtney Cox and Hugh Grant in the beginning of their career have a great performance and hook the attention of this romance. The careful production and the selection of good cast and landscapes are also good points in this movie. My vote is six.",
