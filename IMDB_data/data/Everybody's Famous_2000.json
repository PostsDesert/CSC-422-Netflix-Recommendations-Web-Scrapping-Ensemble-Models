Industry screws over the worker. 2. Worker hatches wacky scheme to redeem himself and save his family and hopefully make lots of money. 3. Worker recruits hapless former co-worker to help with the wacky scheme.\n\nThe new twist is that the father is obsessed with his daughter becoming a singing star. To this end, he kidnaps Belgium's top pop star and as ransom demands that his new song be performed on National TV, preferably with his daughter singing it.\n\nIt's a fluffy piece but thoroughly enjoyable. Just like \"The Full Monty\" you're cheering for everyone in the end.",
