So it shouldn't be confused with \"Welcome to my Nightmare\"...which the IMDB is referring to here. The Nightmare is quite Rare but not impossible to find...and it is fantastic fun...14 songs each introduced by Vincent Price. Features great scenes of Cooper and Vincent Price interacting together...the two were made to work together!"
