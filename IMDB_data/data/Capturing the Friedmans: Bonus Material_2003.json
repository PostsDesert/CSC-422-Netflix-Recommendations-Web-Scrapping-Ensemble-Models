        "reviewBody": "A remarkably well crafted documentary takes us straight to Creepytown USA, and we can't wait to ask the tour guide questions.\n\nCapturing the Friedmans is not so much a search for truth, as it is a portrait of illness itself, and how it transmits through individual to family and on to the community at Large. \n\nThe family's ordeal was recorded by both the lenses of the media and their own movie cameras. Building with this footage, director Andrew Jarecki shows us the Friedmans.\n\nArnold, uses his home video as a document of his progress beyond dysfunction. At times, the home video footage almost seems like amateur propaganda. Almost as if the Friedmans were trying to manufacture their own evidence. Creating the facade of a whole family.\n\nMost of the people interviewed seem to have their own agendas as well. Especially the police.\n\nEvidence and opinion layers, it fascinates and frustrates. frustratingly â€” inconclusive ways. The only clear answer in \"Friedmans\" was that they collapsed under decades of secrets and dysfunction.\n\nThis film also glimpses the effects social pressure, mob mentality and stigma have on truth. We must also question the reliability of the human memory as evidence.",
