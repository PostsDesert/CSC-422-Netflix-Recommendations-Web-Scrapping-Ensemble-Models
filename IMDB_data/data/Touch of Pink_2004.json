        "reviewBody": "This is a funny movie that is a light approach to coming out to a Muslim family. The mother is really the star of this movie--her character was complex, realistic, and comical. Kyle Mac. was excellent in the role of a Cary Grant angel who helps Alim with his problems in life. The movie would not have worked without the Cary Grant angel so my hat is off to the screenwriter for putting that into the screenplay. There were many funny moments between \"Cary\" and Alim. The relationship between Alim and his boyfriend was more realistic than many couples in gay-themed movies. There were conflicts over staying in the closet, there were culture clashes (Pakistani vs. English/Muslim vs. Atheist/Toronto vs. London), and infidelities while the relationship was in turmoil. The issue of responsibility to parents and family versus following ones own feelings about how to live was also touched on. I was a little hesitant to see this film but I am glad I did.",
