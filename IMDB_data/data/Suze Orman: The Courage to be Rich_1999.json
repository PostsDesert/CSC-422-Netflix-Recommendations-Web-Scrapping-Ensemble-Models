        "reviewBody": "I have to say from the outset that I am a Suze Orman fan. This video is true-to-form in the sense that it is advice for the everyperson, on pretty much any budget. She's full of practical advice and realistic answers to the financial questions of a real person with credit card debt, student loans, and an average income. Why the 6? The video was a little on the boring side. She's a good speaker but needs to break it up a little bit with more audience interactions (there are some audience questions included in the Special Features part of the DVD, although the fact that she had graphics ready to answer some of the questions left me wondering if the questions were planted.) I do recommend this for the advice it gives but don't expect to be hugely entertained.",
