I wish I could give you a description of the story but there really is no story. A lot of what happens is completely random and out of the ordinary. The special effects are worse then you could ever imagine and done like that on purpose. The camera work is... well, hard to describe. The acting is pretty bad and over the top at times, but this just adds to it being the worst movie ever made. The only problem I had with this film was I watched it by myself and without a group of friends this movie will get rather repetitive. Still, this was a lot of fun and it's got my vote. 7/10",
