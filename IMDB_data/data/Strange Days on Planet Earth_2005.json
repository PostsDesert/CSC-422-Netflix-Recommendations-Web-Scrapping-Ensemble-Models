It has important info everyone in the world should know about, and everyone should do their part to help with the problems this show points out are going on in the world. I never thought I'd say it, but this documentary doesn't suck. Really though, I think time will show George Bush is responsible for all of these disasters anyway, but the show has no mention of him. I'd recommend showing this in schools all across America and English-speaking countries- but if the DVDs have other languages, that would help too.\n\nAnd also, it has Edward Norton (who played the violent schizophrenic guy in Fight Club) hosting !",
