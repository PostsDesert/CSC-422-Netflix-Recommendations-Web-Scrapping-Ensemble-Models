        "reviewBody": "\"Barney Miller\" showed the gritty realism of police work in New York City in the 1970s, albeit with humor. Skits about the impending bankruptcy of the city, some of the futile criminal behavior (man stuck inside ductwork trying to burglarize a store), the mundane day in, day out existence of police officers with the occasional heart-pounding, adrenalin rush of excitement, and of course, what we in the profession called \"the hairbags\" - the old cops, forever full of stories, content to live in the past as Inspector Lugar exemplifies. To those who say \"Barney Miller\" is dated, I say the show is a timeless slice of life, and can be set in almost any locale and time period. The cast could not have been picked with any more brilliance, and the production was seamless. I say \"Barney Miller\" is a classic for the generations."
