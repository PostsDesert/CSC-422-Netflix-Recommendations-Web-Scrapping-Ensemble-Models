        "reviewBody": "No apology for including this with my 'extreme' movies because not only was it considered so in 1969 it has held up remarkably well and still packs a punch. Whilst I recall it was the fully nude male wrestling scene that attracted most attention originally, it is clear to see now that there was so much more going on that was of just as an extreme nature. For good and bad Lawrence seems extremely well represented with his, love hate relationship with women and his fondness of the work ethic. The full force and carnality of the sexuality in Lawrence's Lady Chatterly is somewhat more muted here but it is the questioning of the trueness of love and the inclusion of same sex relationships that helps this to still be as thought provoking and stimulating. Plus, the performances are fine and the photography excellent with the direction faultless. Runs longer than stated on the box and one wonders if in fact it was ever shown uncut in the cinemas.",
