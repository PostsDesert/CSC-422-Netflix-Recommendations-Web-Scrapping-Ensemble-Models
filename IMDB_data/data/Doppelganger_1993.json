        "reviewBody": "Arguably one of the 90s more neglected horror curiosities Avi Nesher's diabolically duplicitous psychological chiller about Holly Gooding (Drew Barrymore) a Hitchcockian heroine who flees New York, and eventually sets up house with guileless writer Patrick (George Newbern), their burgeoning relationship soon thwarted by the erotic shenanigans of Helen's sinister, dark glasses-sporting doppelg√§nger. Avi Nesher's quixotic, frequently hysterical, dangerously distempered body horror B-Movie is colourfully festooned with psycho-dramatic archetypes: shadowy, fast-talking F. B. I. Creeps, a quietly menacing psychiatrist, Helen's abusive, scar-faced father, and a gorily violent matricide, and a psychologically-spawned super-sinister, polymorphously perverse sibling all creepily conspire against poor Gooding's hope for a new life in l. A! While no one could accuse writer/director Avi Nesher's phantasmagoric freak-out of cinematic subtlety, as his amusingly erratic film's strengths reside in the splendidly skewed presence of sensually sensational scream dream Drew Barrymore, her exquisitely cherubic features, and enthusiastically unfiltered performance are not without considerable charm, and the gelatinously gooey, practical effects-laden, gruesomely gunk-flinging finale is the deliciously crimson cherry atop this entertainingly eccentric 90s creature feature!",
