It is nothing but an ego-trip for a dorkass kid who's hippie dad was not even really friends with Leary, but merely a friend of a two-time acquaintance of Leary's - though he he never quits mentioning \"my dad\" knowing the great Dr. Timothy Leary (which is of course extremely annoying). He apparently felt so awesome doing this film that he won't even quit bobbing his head as he talks either. This is the worst Leary film bar none. But enough of my negative opinionation. If you are a neo-hippie who just can't get enough nostalgia of the good old days, then you might dig this one because it keeps steering off course into the hippie movement. But after you get enough of these old fogies, you may not ever want to call yourself a hippie again."
