The movie says that crazy people have the right to love, too, and it shows how they realize this right. It is another answer to the questions: what is love and do love and morality have a lot in common. The weakest point is the ending scene. First, it made me feel that something needs to be added - a cue, a situation, anything - and, second, it resembles \"The Graduate\" too much. The last scenes of the \"10 years ago\" part are very good, Nick and Sean!"
