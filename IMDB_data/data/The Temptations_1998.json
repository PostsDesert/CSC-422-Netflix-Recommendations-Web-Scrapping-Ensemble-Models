The lives of one of the original Motown legend was wonderfully depicted in this movie. The five members (Paul Williams, Otis Williams , Eddie Kendricks, David Ruffin, and bassist Melvin Blue Franklin lived remarkable lives. Fighting through the segregated southern stats and minimal opportunities, they fought to achieve greatness. In addition to the fantastic acting in this film, viewers can also appreciate th wonderful music made by the temptations, Smokie Robinson, and Barry Gordy. This movie will give you a memorable experience and will leave you wanting more.",
