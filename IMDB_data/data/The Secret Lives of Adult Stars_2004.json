        "reviewBody": "Having always been fascinated with the adult film industry and the people not only in front but also behind the cameras; I must say that this is a pretty good film.\n\nLots of different interviews with people like Randy West and Nina Hartley, who have been around and working since the early 80's (at least!); as well as a lot of other interviews with the newer up and comers.\n\n\"The Secret Lives of Adult Stars\" covers a wide range of topics and touches a lot of bases. Everything from views on penis size, AIDS, condoms, strippers turned porn goddesses, the role of the men, directors, couples in the biz, stalkers, fans... you name it...and there is probably a section of the documentary that deals with the subject.\n\nIf you interested in seeing lots & lots of interviews by some of the industries leading names.... and the subject matter & behind the scenes knowledge is something that interests you, then this reviewer would strongly suggest checking this movie out.\n\nJust keep in mind...this IS a documentary - not a porno.\n\nRecommended!",
