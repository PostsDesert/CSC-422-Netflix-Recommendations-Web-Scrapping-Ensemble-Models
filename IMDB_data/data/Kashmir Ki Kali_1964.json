        "reviewBody": "When I heard the title,I felt the female protagonist might be a headstrong lady or a fear-evoking personality.Instead,she's a tender and lovable 'Champa',. It's a good love story with a neat twist in the second half, which made the film quite watchable and special.The major plus points are the beautiful settings and great music (Each and every song is beautiful to say the least.).The heroine Sharmila Tagore looks extremely beautiful and charmingly innocent.Shammi Kapoor too is good looking.The film moves quite smoothly without making you feel bored. However ,the climax turned out to be a big drag with a rather unusually long fights. Nevertheless,it can be watched with less expectations if you don't mind to kill time !!",
