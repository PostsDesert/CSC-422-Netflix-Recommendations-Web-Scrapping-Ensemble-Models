        "reviewBody": "Lee Rock (1991) Andy Lau stars as Lee Rock, a young man who'll do anything to get out of poverty. So he becomes a police officer. Eventually his life as an officer of the law crosses over with some influential crime bosses. While working his way up through the rankings, he meets all falls in love with two hot women (Chingmy Yau and Man Cheung) he also notices that there are many fellow officers that are corrupt and take bribes and what not. Will Lee Rock stay straight and narrow or will he become a bad cop?\n\nInteresting film because it's followed by two other films. Alone it wouldn't make much sense. Feels more like a made for television film than an actually movie.\n\nRecommended.",
