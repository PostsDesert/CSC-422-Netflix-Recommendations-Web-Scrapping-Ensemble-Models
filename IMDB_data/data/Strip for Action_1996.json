        "reviewBody": "Strip for Action (2009) \n\n** (out of 4)\n\nCrystal and Jocelyn Potter host this compilation video, which has the twin sisters naked in a bathtub and introducing clips from movies including HOUSE ON HOOTER HILL and LUST CONNECTION.\n\nJim Wynorski is credited as directing this film and that makes sense since it's his movies that are shown here. I couldn't identify each movie as I haven't seen all of them but HOUSE ON HOOTER HILL gets the most play time here so that takes up a big chunk of the 53-minute running time.\n\nObviously, being a compilation movie means that there's really nothing too ground-breaking here as we get a variety of sex scenes from other movies. The new footage dealing with the twins are good enough for what they are but there's really not too much action as the twins simply speak to the camera.\n\nSTRIP FOR ACTION is decent entertainment for what it is but I think people would be better off watching the full features instead."
