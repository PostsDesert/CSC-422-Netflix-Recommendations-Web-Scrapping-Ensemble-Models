        "reviewBody": "This movie was the first film for the popular Bratz doll line, and portrays the girls as typical high school teenagers struggling with challenging homework projects and complicated social lives. It promotes friendship and self expression for its main theme, yet is not excessively cheesy unlike some children's cartoons. The simple animation is charming and makes a nice change from the more modern CGI films. It is really suitable for any age, but probably best for girls aged 8-13, but of course adults could love it too. The storyline is simple yet effective, and I would recommend this to anyone who loves girly cartoons, therefore I think it is by far the best of all the Bratz films, and well worth the money.",
