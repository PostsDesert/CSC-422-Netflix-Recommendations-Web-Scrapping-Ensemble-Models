        "reviewBody": "Billing this as the tale of \"the last woman who was executed in Britain\" sorta lets you know up front that Miranda Richardson's widescreen debut is going to end badly.\n\nDirector Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) pulls gut~wrenching performances from his leads, Miranda Richardson, Rupert Everett & the always~underrated Ian Holm, in this fascinating fact~based story about utter sexual obsession.\n\nSet in the dark '50s.\n\nRuth Ellis (Richardson) runs and lives above a nightclub/brothel frequented by several of London's wealthy gadflies. She's platinum blonde, all brass and ummm... well~liked by the local gentry.\n\nShe also has a young son named Andy, about to enter school, who turns the blindest of innocent eyes to Mom's lifestyle.\n\nEnter David (Everett), a sullen alcoholic rich boy and LeMans auto racer wannabe who's taken in by Ruth's wiles within moments of seeing her for the first time ~ after being introduced to Ruth and her \"club\" by his equally well~heeled close friend Desmond (Holm).\n\nWhat unfolds is the single most riveting ~ and more importantly, believable ~ love/hate relationship film I've seen. There have been tons of movies about obsessive lust (and I'm not talking about the flix they rent behind that door at the back of your video store whose \"A\" section takes up three aisles) but this one is a real treat.\n\nDavid, you see, is seriously involved with another woman when he meets Ruth... yet beds the latter in quick fashion. The other woman (eventually his fiancee) is the rub. As is David's penchant for getting drunk and simultaneously developing still a third wandering eye.\n\nStill, it's Ruth he wants. To the point of showing up at the oddest of times to woo (or just rant drunkenly, incoherently at ~ or just to hit) her. All the while winnowing his way deeply into Ruth and her son's hearts and lives.\n\nMeanwhile Desmond stands stoically by until nearly the bitter end, supporting Ruth during LeMans~boy's long absences and sustaining her each time David fails to live up to his promises, which is pretty much always.\n\nThe \"fights betwixt the leads\" scenes are the best, the most creatively acted and directed.\n\nAfter a while, Newell yanks you into the almost~triangle between the three and one begins to attempt to choose sides. This proves to be impossible, as none of the characters are particularly sympathetic.\n\nIE: this ain't a Hollywood movie. Each character has flaws which are well~defined, there's no happy ending and (are you listening, Jim Cameron?)... no sequel.\n\nRichardson is simply astonishing in her premiere. Each note she plays, screaming or smoldering, is just right (hence Miranda's Rights).\n\nEverett's superb as the sociopathically obsessed lover.\n\nAnd Holm is, well, brilliant. Color him unrequited with a vengeance.\n\n9 of 10 Niro~Stars",
