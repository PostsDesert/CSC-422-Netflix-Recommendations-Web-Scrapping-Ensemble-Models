        "reviewBody": "This film is atypical love storey of two strangers and makes hou sympathise for two protagonists. The end is surprising and disturbing, these are only positives. But film is very slow, you keep wondering why the British sgnt is not working, how he gets all the time of his life to spend with his lover only. You wonder why those French resistance soldiers are shown as caricatures /cartoons rather than hard boiled, tough soldiers resisting Germans. You wonder why they can't kill that lady when only one british srgnt is guarding her. In all, mot a very enjoyable experience and no interesting moments in film except the end.",
