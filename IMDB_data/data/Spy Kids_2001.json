        "reviewBody": "This was a silly kids' adventure story but still fun the younger ones and for adults, thanks to colorful scenes, great special effects, decent humor and a nice family tone to it. The kids are alright, except the girl is a little bossy, and the villains aren't too nasty. This also looks very good on DVD.\n\nIncluded in the color and characters are \"the thumb people\" who were especially fun to watch.\n\nThe only problem I found with it is the last 30 minutes in which it got too silly and emphasized (typical Hollywood) how the kids can do the job better than the adults, which a ludicrous film clich√©. However, overall \"family unity\" gets a big boost in this here, even in the end, and that good message is probably a big reason this movie was such a success.",
