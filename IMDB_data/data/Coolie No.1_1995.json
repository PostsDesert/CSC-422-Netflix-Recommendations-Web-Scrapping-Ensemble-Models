Lost interest on that point. Just for Govinda and songs completed this one.\n\nNo one can match with Crazy Mohan dialogs in the original one. As I liked the Tamil version more, this one not stick in my mind.\n\nOne time watchable for the story that explores the comedy in each and every scene.\n\nI would suggest to watch the original one than this one."
