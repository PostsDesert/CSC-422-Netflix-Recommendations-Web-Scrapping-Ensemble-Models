        "reviewBody": "This is a concert that features one of folk rock's most profound and important figures. Joni Mitchell is an amazing singer and artist who draws on experiences ranging from her travels across the country to the time she spent in the Canadian wilderness. This concert is a testimony towards Joni's talent. A must see my any Mitchell fan. The music played in the performance spans over four decades. Joni Mitchell performs in an intimate setting and plays with a jazzy light feel found in albums like Hejira. Gram Nash is also present at this concert Joni's paintings are shown off too. A great great performance. Although the concert is more recent, Joni has not lost any skill and her voice has remained unique.",
