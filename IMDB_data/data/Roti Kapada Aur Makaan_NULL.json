        "reviewBody": "If compared with other Indian commercial films, Roti Kapada Aur Makaan does not have much flow.\n\nI'm not sure about the status and the financial conditions of the Indian singers at the present time. But this film indicates that, during the 70's, even the best singers would get nowhere with their talents.\n\n In this film, Manuj Kumar is a singer with a legendry voice (Mukesh), yet he has neither fame nor money.\n\nIf talented singers did make a good living out their arts in India during the 70's, then this is perhaps the film's big flaw.\n\nBut overall, Roti Kapda Aur Makaan is probably one of Bollywood's few films that actually makes sense.\n\nThe direction, acting and story line are superb. The songs are related to the story, and are always inspiring to listen to.\n\nMost Bollywood's films are hardly watch able, but it will be a pleasure to watch this one more than twice."
