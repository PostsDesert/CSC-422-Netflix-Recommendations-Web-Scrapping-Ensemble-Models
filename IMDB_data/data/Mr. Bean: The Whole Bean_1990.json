There's not much dialogue in this film but it's enjoyable to watch Bean's facial expressions and the situations he ends up in.\n\nA lot of funny scenes take place in his car (how he passed a driving test is beyond me). In one episode he brushes his teeth and gets dressed-whilst he is driving.\n\nAnother funny thing is that Mr Bean doesn't seem to have much family or friends-except for his teddy bear. Bean is fiercely protective of his teddy bear and it makes me laugh watching scenes with him in.\n\nI could go into detail about other funny scenes in the series but all I'll say is go out and buy the videos. They really are amusing."
