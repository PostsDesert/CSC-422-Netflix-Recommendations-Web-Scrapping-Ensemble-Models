If you've seen this rarity, let me know in some way, okay? Anyway, \"The Hideout\" is one movie that has understandably been forgotten. Kids - the main audience this movie was made for - may not mind the movie's often atrocious acting as well as the often lack of solid production values that their parents will notice. But kids will soon want to watch something else if you sit them down in front of this movie. For one thing, there's not much in the way of action, a big reason being that there is almost no (onscreen) violence of any kind to be found. But the biggest problem is that the movie is unbelievably boring. Though it's only about ninety minutes long, the movie is so relentlessly padded that its story could easily be told in half of that running time. Leave this in whatever thrift store you may find a copy of!"
