        "reviewBody": "the movie was amazing and I've been a fan of it since I was 2. Extremely well written and the storyline was able to show all aspects of the family and Jackson career without making anyway out to be the bad guy. The story shows the Jackson boys from the very start of their career. It shows the in and outs of their careers as well as their business and father-son relationship with Joe. Trust me, it's more than you ever thought you knew about the family. From the excitement and what it was like to be in the public eye, to it's effects on the young men's personal lives. This is truly a beautifully written, well- respected depiction of the Jackson 5's American Dream.",
