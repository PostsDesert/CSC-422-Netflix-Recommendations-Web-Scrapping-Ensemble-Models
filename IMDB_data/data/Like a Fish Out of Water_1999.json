It's light, funny, goofy, tasteful, and suitable for the whole family. At the time of writing, it's available in the USA from Amazon Prime Video. More reviews are available there.\n\nA Jewish widower from Argentina and his 11 year old daughter emigrate to Israel. He's pumping gas while looking for an acting job. Visiting a park with his daughter, he's instantly charmed by a lady doing a power walk, but she's standoffish, and also more religiously observant than he is. He enrolls in Hebrew class, and coincidentally, she's the teacher. She reluctantly agrees to tutor his Hebrew pronunciation for an acting audition, even though it's for a soap opera, a genre she hates. Complicating the situation are his scheming daughter, his ambiguous family relationships, a 'religious' skullcap that won't stay on his head, her matchmaking mother, her dad's furtive love of soap operas, and an obnoxious soldier who just won't give up trying to date her. How could an easy going guy and religious lady navigate these perilous waters?",
