        "reviewBody": "As in every comedy, there are things that are very funny and things that are annoying or stupid. You just hope that the \"good\" outweighs the \"bad.\" I think that's the case here, even though I traded in the tape. However, I did watch it a couple of times, so there are enough laughs to make this worth seeing. There are enough odd characters, too. That's no surprise when you see the supporting cast: Stanley Tucci, Larry Miller, Fiona Shaw and Tom Arnold. All of them put added spark to the film. Tucci, as \"Meurte,\" is most obvious as he continually tries to mug the leading couple, played by Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid. Miller plays a weird cop with a lisp and a very weird accent. I guess you could call this movie \"quirky.\"\n\nTurner and Quaid are so smug as modern-day Nick and Nora Charles, you want to root for \"Muerte\" to succeed. Frankly, I never found Turner, except perhaps in \"Body Heat,\" to be that alluring. However, I think she is an underrated comedienne. \n\nAs a whole, this comedy is a little rough in spots, hence the PG-13 rating which often means more profanity than R-rated films. This is not for the kiddies, but adults will laugh.",
