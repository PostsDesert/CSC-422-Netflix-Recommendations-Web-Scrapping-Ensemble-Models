        "reviewBody": "A lot of LBT's are childish nonsense, even good ones such as LBT 2 and LBT 3. However, this one actually deals with a few adult issues, which is extraordinarily strange for a LBT. Of course, it deals with child issues as well, in case you didn't realise. This film also has Michael York as a new \"flier\" called Pterano.\n\nThis film also has pleasant songs, good humour and a gripping adventure so it should be good for any LBT fan - or most other people as well! Yet another thing about this film that sets it apart is that it has different animation from any other LBT film, before and after.\n\nThe plot goes like this: Littlefoot wakes up in the middle of the night after some wanderers have come to the valley and sees an amazing light fall onto a mountain nearby. No-one really believes Littlefoot when he tells many dinosaurs about it, but he is determined to go out and find it. Meanwhile, Petrie's uncle has suddenly appeared from crashing onto a tree branch...\n\nSo enjoy this different, good quality sequel, \"Land Before Time: The Stone Of Cold Fire\"! :-)",
