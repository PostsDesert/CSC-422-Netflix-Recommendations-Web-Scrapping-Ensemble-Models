        "reviewBody": "I believe that every fan of The White Stripes and music in general will appreciate this documentary. It offers an in-depth look of the band on their tour of Canada, capturing great live performances as well as interesting interviews.\n\nThis film is perfectly shot, the combination of black and white and color footage was great, the tempo is perfect and it is emotionally charged as well. If you are a true fan of the band you will already know most of the things talked about in interviews, but if you are not, I am sure you will still be interested to hear how Jack and Meg approach their music, what inspires it, how they work on stage because it seems quite different from the approach of many other musicians. Jack White is definitely one of the most original and inventive musicians of his generation and listening to him being interviewed is always a treat.\n\nI might sound a bit overexcited but this truly is a beautiful documentary about two interesting, grounded, real and beautiful people. Unfortunately I never had a chance to see The White Stripes play live so seeing this meant even more. All you music lovers out there will enjoy this for sure.",
