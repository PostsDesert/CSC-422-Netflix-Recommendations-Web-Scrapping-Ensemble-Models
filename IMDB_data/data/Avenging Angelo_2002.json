        "reviewBody": "I was pleasantly surprised when I eyed this Sly film! He is so good with comedy! He has a sarcastic wit about him & he can do things with those big brown puppy eyes that just make ya melt!! He's also in GREAT shape but I'm sorry, his hairpiece in this is just too noticeable. (Sorry, Sly! We still love ya tho!)\n\nStory Line: Frankie (Sly) is bodyguard for Mr. Alegheri (the late great Anthony Quinn). He gets \"hit\" in a restaurant when Frankie leaves him unattended for a minute or two. All his life, he's been 'on the job' for Quinn, watching his daughter who doesn't even know she's his daughter (Stowe, with the HUGE brown eyes!!) Anyway, it's time for her to find out & to have Frankie watching her closer than ever now & they soon fall in love. Like he says, \"I couldn't keep the distance anymore!\") He almost loses her to another handsome Italian (the young guy who played opposite Diane Lane in Under the Tuscan Sun) but that relationship went \"dead\"! (Pun intended!) \n\nI don't know why this film was given an R rating. Granted, there were 2 times the \"f\" word was used but I've heard that in PG-13's!! Perhaps it would have gotten seen by more people if it were rated PG-13. I know I would have seen it sooner! This is clearly a woman's movie, a love story for Sly FINALLY!! (Unless you count The Specialist?) Too bad he didn't get them when he was younger. Ooooooooh - to heat up the screen!! YO!!"
