        "reviewBody": "I generally hate these teen sex comedies and I approached \"Van Wilder\" with hesitation, but I actually found it to be quite entertaining and humorous (if you're in the right mood, I suppose).\n\nRyan Reynolds (doing a great Chevy Chase impersonation) is a guy in his late 20s who has been at college for eight years and still doesn't have a graduation in sight. His father, a rich politician (played by Tim Matheson), finally decides to cut off his son's money and as a result, Van has to think of a way to come up with enough cash to stay in school.\n\nPretty soon Van becomes a party planner and uses his knowledge on partying to throw great ones for nerds. He makes money off of it and his business soon becomes quite lucrative.\n\nIf you like National Lampoon humor, you may like this. If you don't, you probably won't. I gave up on National Lampoon a long time ago but this is one of their better efforts in recent years. Don't get me wrong, it's not a great movie; but I found Reynolds (who seems to pick up a lot of flak) to be quite funny and Matheson and other ex-Lampoon star cameos were amusing.\n\nRecommended for those who can enjoy stupid humor. If you liked \"Dumb and Dumber,\" you'll probably enjoy this.",
