        "reviewBody": "I fell in love with the show right away I guess being a girl. I was working at the time when the series finale aired. I felt sorry for the entire show's cast and crew who most likely expected to return for another season. But the CBS executives decided to cancel the show. I along with other wrote letters trying to save the show. I always looked forward to Saturdays on CBS. Shame on you CBS! Now onto business. There is only one Dr Quinn and Sully. I always Sully was a cutie. And William Shockly who played Hank the bartender. Robert E looked like a trusting person, Johnny Cash who guest starred looked like a gentle person. There have been three people playing Elizabeth Quinn (Dr Quinn's mother) the third one was the best. No offense to the series pilot or Jane Wyman. Certain episodes will stand out. The wedding of Mike and Sully. The birth of Katie. Even the episode where Grace and Robert E bought a house in town and in comes the KKK. That's how it was for black people. You can't forget when Ingrid died. Or Colleen's wedding to Andrew. You can see one episode on The Hallmark Channel and you will be hooked. Thanks to The Hallmark Channel for airing reruns of Dr Quinn Medicine Woman. Has anyone besides me noticed that the guy who played General Custer in the wedding episode was the very same guy who played the banker Preston Lodge III?"
