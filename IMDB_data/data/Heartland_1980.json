        "reviewBody": "How in the name of all that is good could anyone make a bad documentary if it's about musical geniuses like Bob Marley, Jacob Miller, and Peter Tosh and their music? Ask the creators of Heartland Reggae. Heartland Reggae is a potentially incredible documentary featuring amazing performances by Bob Marley, Inner Circle, Jody Mowatt, Peter Tosh and other stars of the reggae scene during the late 70s and early 80s. It was an era when the music was incredible and the political significance of it was immense. The problem with the film is that the editing, narrating, and other production aspects are horrible. A great story with great footage and great music falls flat. The actual performances are edited in a way that cuts out the best part and drags out too long on the bad parts. The scenes that are edited in are silly and make no sense. The narrator has a heavy and hard to understand accent that make his ranting absolutely useless and flat out annoying! If you like good music...check Heartland Reggae out. If you like good films...pass it."
