None really has much of a story to tell or much of anything interesting to say. Film fails to give real insight on life as an exotic dancer. Funniest moment (though probably not intentionally so) is when one of the ladies compares getting breast implants to the special effects in Star Wars.\n\nThough not an exploitative piece of film making, the DVD box bizarrely touted that \"2 of the 5 women interviewed have died.\""
