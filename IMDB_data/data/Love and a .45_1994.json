        "reviewBody": "Tarantino-esq action thriller which is worth a look and will not disappoint fans of Quentin's films particularly True Romance. It has (lots of ) violence, rapid gun fire, white trash characters and a large dollop of that comic book humour that has got Quent where he is today. It is easy to see that this film takes its inspiration from the aforementioned film, but it does stand on its own feet as the script and the action is good enough to entertain you throughout. Bellows and Zellwegger are good in the leads and the supporting Rory Cochrane is great fun as their psychotic madman 'friend' out to settle a few old scores. Peter Fonda is a standout as Zellweggers' dad. Highly recommended.",
