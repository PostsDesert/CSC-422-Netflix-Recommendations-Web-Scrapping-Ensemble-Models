        "reviewBody": "Wow. Just wow!\n\nThis 2003 is without a doubt one of the all-time better of the \"Godzilla\" movies in the franchise. I was so pleasantly surprised with this movie as I sat down to watch it for the first time in 2019, 16 years after it was released.\n\nThe storyline in the movie is fairly straightforward, just as they always are in these kaiju movies; Godzilla returns to duke it out with some other kaiju somewhere in Japan. Yeah, not much of any new creative thinking there. However, the Mechagodzilla aspect of the storyline was actually downright ridiculous, and it didn't really do much for the movie. Luckily the rest of the storyline was strong enough not to be weighed down by the stupidity of the Mechagodzilla aspect.\n\nBut still, it was so very enjoyable to watch the movie, not really because of the storyline, but because of the action and the special effects.\n\nThe acting in the movie, well, let's just say it is a \"Godzilla\" movie and leave it at that? You know what you are getting here if you have seen at least just one kaiju movie before.\n\nNow, the special effects in \"Gojira tai Mosura tai Mekagojira: T么ky么 S.O.S.\" (aka \"Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.\") were phenomenal and some of the best I have seen in a Godzilla movie predating the most recent \"Godzilla\" movies. I was so impressed with the way that Godzilla looked and moved in this 2003 movie, but even more so with Mothra. Wow, she was just phenomenal in this movie, and so much more life-like than in any other movie previously seen with Mothra.\n\nAs for the fight scenes. Again, I must say wow! Yeah, I have been bedazzled by the \"Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.\" movie, no doubt about it. The fight scenes throughout the movie were phenomenal and very, very satisfying to us whom enjoy watching these kaiju movies.\n\nIf you haven't already seen \"Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.\" and find yourself given the chance, I can strongly and warmly recommend that you do so, because this movie was really good.",
