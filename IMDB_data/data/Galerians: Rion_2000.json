        "reviewBody": "Galerians: Rion has got to be one of the best 3D anime movies I've ever seen, despite the rushed feel. The movie is pretty much straightforward, one scene after another. Because of that, the movie tends to feel short. The plot is wonderful, as it is practically based off of the game Galerians.\n\nBoth the English and Japanese soundtracks are great. You can watch both versions of the movie and still get sucked into the movie's intricate plot. However, watching the movie with the original Japanese background music seems to have more of the horror feel, as to watching the English dubbed seems to detract the viewer from the graphics and the plot.\n\nThe graphics of Galerians: Rion are pretty much fantastic. It's not as great as Square-Enix's works (ex. Final Fantasy), but at least Galerians has it's own style.\n\nAll-in-all, I give Galerians: Rion an 8/10 for the wonderful plot, eye-pleasing graphics, and the beautiful music.",
