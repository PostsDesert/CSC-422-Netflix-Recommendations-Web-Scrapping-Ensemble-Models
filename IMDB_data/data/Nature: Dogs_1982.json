Even though there are fewer programs per season (probably due to spiraling production costs), the reruns are so good you don't mind. 'Nature' is the main reason I've contributed to public television stations for nearly thirty years.\n\nAccording to the official 'Nature' website at pbs.org, \"The series has won more than 450 honors from the television industry, the international wildlife film community, parent groups, and environmental organizations - including 10 Emmy Awards, three Peabody Awards, and the first honor ever given to a program by the Sierra Club.\"",
