That is not a quibble, since a good part of the interest of this movie is based upon its serving as a fairly rare window into life in that period. Whereas, there are skads of movies set in the 30's, and a fair number set in the 20s (in addition to the silents of that era), as the plot summary and some user comments erroneously have the movie era.\n\nStanford White, America's greatest architect and one of New York's leading figures at the time, was murdered in 1906 -- which is of course the beginning date of this movie. It ends with war being declared as announced by a newspaper headline -- WWI of course. Which marked the end of the era."
