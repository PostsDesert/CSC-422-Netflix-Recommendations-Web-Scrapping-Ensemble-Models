        "reviewBody": "If you like LL Cool J, then this movie is for you. It was pretty good and had some funny moments. Most of which come from the smart mouth comments made by no-nonsense Eva. There are also some good gossip scenes at the beauty shop. The story is nothing original; you know exactly where it is going. Of course, the player falls for the girl whose heart he is supposed to break. They just made a mistake at the end by having a really cheesy, knight comes riding in on a white horse, type of moment. It was too hollywood and didn't really go with the rest of the film.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: There is no mystery with this movie. It is what it is. So, if you like mildly funny moments with a stereotypical romantic plot, then you may want to give this a try."
