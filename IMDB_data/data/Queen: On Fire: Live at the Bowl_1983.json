I've been operatically trained for 7yrs now and am about to go to school for vocal performance and I think Freddie's got a ton of talent! I also can't believe you're comparing Queen; one of the most contributing rock bands to the Spice Girls; talentless, daddy-did-not-love-me, girl powered, children! I, on the other hand believe is one of the greatest bands of all times... I have not got to hear all of this live album, but what I heard was entertaining! Maybe not their best performance, but still good!",
