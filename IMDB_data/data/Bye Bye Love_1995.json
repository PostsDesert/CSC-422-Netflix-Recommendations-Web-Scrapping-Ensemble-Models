        "reviewBody": "Recently divorced pals Matthew Modine, Randy Quaid and Paul Reiser tackle new relationships, their ex-wives and their disgruntled children in this strange little film that is never sure where it wants to go with the audience. The cast is very likeable. Rob Reiner does some excellent work as a radio talk show therapist who is despised by the key players. However comedy comes and goes and the drama feels forced on too many occasions. On a sad note, excellent character-actor Ed Flanders committed suicide shortly after completing this film. 2.5 out of 5 stars."
