Her family, of course, wants her to marry a nice Indian boy and carry on the family traditions, but she meets and falls instantly in love with Jay, a nice boy that is definitely NOT Indian. The songs (of which there are many) are delivered in the Bollywood style of breaking into song at any moment (even more so than in American Musicals). All songs are in Hindi, even though the main character states in the film that she cannot speak Hindi. The music is so obviously fantasy in the movie that it seems okay, though. This was a lot of fun, and an enjoyable story.",
