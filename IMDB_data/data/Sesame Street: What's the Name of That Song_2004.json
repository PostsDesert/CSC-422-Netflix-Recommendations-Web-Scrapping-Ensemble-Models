Hearing different songs, the furry supermonster decides to go on a mission to find the one song the world can sing together. Thankfully, he crash landed near Sesame Street residents Big Bird and Elmo, who agree to help him find that song by asking random people.\n\nMade to celebrate Sesame Street's 35th anniversary, this video is a celebration of Sesame Street's greatest songs. Most of them are taken from the show itself, like Between, sung by Wayne Brady, and even some golden Sesame oldies like Do De Rubber Duck and Get Along, while others are either new or are re-edited to add in special effects (like Doin' The Pidgeon and Eight Balls of Fur).",
