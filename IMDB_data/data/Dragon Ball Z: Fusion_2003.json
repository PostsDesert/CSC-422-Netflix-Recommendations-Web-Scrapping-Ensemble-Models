        "reviewBody": "\"Dragonball Z\" wasn't the first anime I got introduced to. But is the first series that made an impact on me. I never could have dreamed that a cartoon with (what seemed like) so many goofy characters could move me so much. The first thing that I noticed that was so different from other shows were the epic battles. It took several episodes for a battle to finish. When I saw the battle between Goku and Frieza on Cartoon Network I got hooked immediately. At that time there wasn't a show that was as exciting as \"Dragonball Z\". This was a show that had great action,a lot of comedy and even drama. \"Dragonball Z was full of surprises and you didn't know what to expect. OK,after a few seasons the story may got predictable but it still had the best action ever seen in a cartoon. But the most important thing as should be in every show were the characters. Even the most clumsy and useless characters managed to do something that made you care for them. I have re watched some episodes and they still are very effective and exciting. \"Dragonball Z\" is here to stay forever,a true classic!",
