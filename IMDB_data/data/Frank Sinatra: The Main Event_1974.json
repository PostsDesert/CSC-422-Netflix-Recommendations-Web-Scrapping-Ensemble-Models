        "reviewBody": "Frank Sinatra filled the most famous indoor sports arena in the world Madison Square Garden for this concert. A quick look around during audience shots you'll see many a celebrity. The event is introduced by a man more known for sports than entertainment Howard Cosell.\n\nThe current Madison Square Garden is either the fourth or fifth arena to use that name. A few months earlier the first entertainers to open the place were Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. Like them Frank Sinatra sold the place out.\n\nThe vocal highlight for me of all the songs he sang was Angel Eyes. He recorded it for Capitol records in the 50s and it's usually was included in his live concerts. He puts a lot into this version.\n\nI have to say that I was amused by the fact that Buddy Rich was in the audience. These two had a rough history going all the way back to the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra. Never though I'd see him at a Sinatra event.\n\nFrank's usual standard of vocal excellence is met.",
