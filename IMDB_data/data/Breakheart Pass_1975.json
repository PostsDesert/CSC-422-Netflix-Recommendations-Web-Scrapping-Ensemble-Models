        "reviewBody": "The movie is a little too long, the plot isn't the greatest, and it \"drags\" here and there, but all the actors are excellent - Richard Crenna and Ben Johnson in particular. Charles Bronson does what he does best - be Charles Bronson. It has good stunts, and plenty of action - what you expect from a Western. To me the main item of interest is that Yakima Canutt, the first great movie stuntman, and later a great stunt coordinator, was the 2nd unit director. It was his last movie. He died the next year - 1976. He started in silent movies, worked with John Wayne on many occasions, and staged the chariot race in the nine-Oscar winning \"Ben Hur.\" It's fitting that his last movie was a Western.",
