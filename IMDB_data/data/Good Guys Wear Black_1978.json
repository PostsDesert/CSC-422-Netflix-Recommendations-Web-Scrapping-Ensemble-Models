        "reviewBody": "Former soldier John T. Booker (Chuck Norris), who is now a teacher, takes a leave of absence when he learns his friends from Vietnam are mysteriously dying. Booker, who was part of an elite unit in the war called the Black Tigers, starts visiting his Army buddies to try to warn them that they are in danger. As more Black Tigers are killed, Booker connects the murder spree to a high-ranking Vietnamese official who is working with a U. S. politician (James Franciscus).\n\nOne of Chuck Norris' first films, and it's an efficiently made political conspiracy film, well directed, though a little talky and slow moving. Let's face it we watch Norris films for the roundhouses and the spin kicks, and he sure obliges, especially around mid-way. Watch out for that flying drop kick through the windshield. His acting is not too bad either for an amateur, however it's James Fransciscus who steals the scene as a slimy politician.\n\nOverall, a mildly diverting film from Norris, but the best is yet to come.",
