Was the talk of the Sundance shuttle bus...but not in a good way.\n\nToo many amateurish techniques. Voice over narration in an attempt to get a noir feeling but most of the time was actually for exposition because the story wasn't getting told on the screen.\n\nBad camera technique that would be okay in small doses (ie: a dream sequence) but was tiring and distracting from the opening credits onward. Kept waiting for the \"real\" movie to start.\n\nThe girl from Monday doesn't make an appearance for quite awhile in the movie and then gets left in an apartment to learn to use her body (or course she swam out of the ocean quite well).\n\nAnyway...I had to leave about the time the boy was getting \"raped\" in the school bathroom. Time is too precious at Sundance and I went to \"Rory O'Shea was Here\" and the contrast couldn't have been higher between the two.\n\nIs probably a waste of time to anyone but his fans.\n\nD.",
