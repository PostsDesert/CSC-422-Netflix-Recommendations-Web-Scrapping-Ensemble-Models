The image of the baby playing ball and trying to stand up will be forever burned into my psyche. The day after viewing, I found myself thinking of his awkward movements and his upsetting cries.\n\nNice little twist at the end- not on the level of some flicks today. but hey for '73, it definitely impressed me.\n\nRecommended for fans of early John Waters, 70's TV horror movies, etc. Would make a good double feature with \"Bad Boy Bubby.\" 8 out of 10, kids.",
