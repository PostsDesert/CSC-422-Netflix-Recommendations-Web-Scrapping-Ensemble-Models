I must say I was very disappointed after I had thought it was going to be something really enjoyable and interesting. It proves to have been done only for money and maybe to promote Bond's entrance in the 2000s. The only highlight of the progamme are interviews with Bond actors, although our friends don't say anything new, well maybe except Roger Moore who tells us some funny anecdotes and helps the documentary not be be totally boring. But I know I can always count on Roger.",
