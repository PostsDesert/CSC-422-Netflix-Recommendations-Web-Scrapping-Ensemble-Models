        "reviewBody": "This film has a hackneyed plot with only adequate acting. The historical inaccuracies with which it was filled, irritated me immensely. They show a radio broadcast being listened to (before radio stations, as such, existed) on a radio available only in the 1930's. First sequence showed crossing the Atlantic in 1895 on a sailing ship when these were obsolete. Referred to Greta Garbo in the '20's before she became a star in America. Showed travel in Wisconsin in 1914 in a stage coach! Young screen writers (or maybe authors) need to research history more thoroughly before putting their films on the air to be viewed by people who know more about these things than they do!"
