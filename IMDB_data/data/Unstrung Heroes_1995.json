Through the movie, you're not saying, 'Hey, why is Kramer being serious?' Instead, you say, 'Wow, Michael Richards is a good actor.' This was a rare opportunity to see him do a better-than-Kramer-by-not-being-Kramer performance. I would love to see him do more serious work like this. It's very tearful at the end. Parts are mildly funny, but this movie is pure drama and it's beautiful."
