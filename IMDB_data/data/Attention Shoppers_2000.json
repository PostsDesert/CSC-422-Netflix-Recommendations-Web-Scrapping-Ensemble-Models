        "reviewBody": "The plot for this movie would make a good 10 minute sketch on SNL. It doesn't stretch to the playing time of the movie. The writing is periodically clever and sometimes amusing, but never really funny.\n\nI think the goal was to make something like Office Space about peripheral actors on a non-sensational sitcom. But the execution isn't there. The movie tries to be serious at times but would have been better with a lighter subplot.\n\nThe movie takes the usual \"everything outside Hollywood is corny and hick\" attitude. K-mart, Houston -- you know, real rubes.\n\nThe only remotely developed characters are the main character (played by Enrique Suarez) and the Houston limo driver played by Michael Lerner. The latter is excellent in his role. Meanwhile, Martin Mull is very weak in a brief role as a flight attendant.\n\nIf someone forces you to watch the movie you should resist, but not so much that you might hurt yourself. It's not perfectly terrible, either."
