        "reviewBody": "The performances are excellent. I did not even recognize Olivia D'Abo.\n\nIt would be impossible to explain the plot of this film, and that is one of the reasons why I like it so much.\n\nThe film touches on the importance of family ties, without being sappy. It touches on the the importance of forgiveness, without being preachy.\n\nIt has plenty of \"quirky\" characters and situations, but not so much as to make them ridiculous. That is not to say that they are not absurd, and that is a good thing.\n\nIt is not a ghost story as some synopses might cause one to believe. (Albeit, I might not have watched it if it were not for my being given that idea from a Comcast blurb.) \n\nI recommend A Texas Funeral to anybody who likes films that have plots that are difficult to detect in which direction they are going to go, but are a joy to follow.",
