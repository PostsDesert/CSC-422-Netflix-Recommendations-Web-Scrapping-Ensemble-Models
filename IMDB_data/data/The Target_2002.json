You could say it is a bit my fault for expecting ... but on the other hand I really do not know what to make of this movie overall.\n\nThe action is decent I guess .. but considering the people in front of the screen, you sometimes might wonder if there are amateurs at work. It has a couple of moments - and Dennis Hopper almost channels Gary Busey ... but not at his craziest level ... still quite mad. And the resolution/ending? Again not many words for that I can convey what ... it is ... what it tries to do - I know it does not succeed on any real level.",
