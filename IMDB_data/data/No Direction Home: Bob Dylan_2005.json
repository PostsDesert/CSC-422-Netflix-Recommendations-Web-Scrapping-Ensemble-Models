CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL\n\n-----------The Only Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook!-----------------------\n\nNo Direction Home is, without a doubt, the very best music-themed Documentary I have ever seen in my life! For anyone who considers themselves someone with a special interest in pop culture, music, sociology or even contemporary history, this mesmerizing Martin Scorsese documentary not only is a \"Must see\", but I would say a \"Must have\"! (As in \"your collection\"!)\n\nHere we gain the most fascinating insight into many aspects of Dylan's early career, his creative process, his relationships with other artists and music industry insiders, (particularly with one time love interest, Joan Baez) and the general interaction of Bob Dylan, his music, his growing popularity and the overall effect of these on our culture in the 1960's!\n\nSome of what is covered I think I was previously aware of, some of it, I wasn't, and quite a bit of it had simply been forgotten, owing to the half a century that has passed! What surprised me most in DIRECTION HOME? Well, Joan Baez is interviewed extensively and has perhaps the most on-screen time other than Bob Dylan himself. In the 60's and 70's, I always admired Baez as a very talented, outspoken and highly principled young woman But, quite honestly, never considered her as being very attractive. She has to be, what?... Like mid-to late 50's when she was interviewed for this documentary.\n\nTo see her now, so mature, articulate, radiant, overflowing with self- confidenceWell, let's just say that all of this made it EXTREMELY HARD for me to overlook her on screen appearance! Well, I certainly hope this review did not contain too much information!\n\n9********* ........... ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!\n\nAny comments, questions or observations, in English o en Espa√±ol, are most welcome!....",
