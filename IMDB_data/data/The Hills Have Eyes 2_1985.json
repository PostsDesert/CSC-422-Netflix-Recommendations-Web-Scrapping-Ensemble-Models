        "reviewBody": "The Hills Have Eyes (2006) is a remake of the 1977 original and follows a family who get stranded on a government atomic wasteland, which they find is home to a murderous mutant family. I definitely prefer this to the original. It was a really good and terrifying film! I loved it!\n\nFirstly, The characters were very likable and the acting was great too, the performances got gradually better as the film progressed. I specifically liked Doug, he was an absolute sweetheart. My main criticism for the original is that I didn't care for the characters, but I was really rooting for them in this one.\n\nThis movie had good visual effects and was very brutal, it was a hell of a lot more disturbing than the original! The gore was very impressive and looked very realistic, which made it hard to watch at some points.\n\nThe film included a classic 2000s horror score which added to the experience of watching. Also the sound design was effective and really stood out in certain scenes.\n\nThe cinematography was great; the film was full of bleak colour palettes and very well it scenes. Alongside this, there were also some cool editing techniques and good cuts between shots.\n\nThe film started with a gripping intro, and some super creepy opening credits. It immediately had an ominous and eerie atmosphere, and throughout the film the tension just gets higher. I was hooked almost straight away! It really was a sad tale that made me deeply upset for the characters. The ending was great, and although the final shot was cheesy, I still liked it.",
