That being said, this is one of the best movie versions of this opera around. Domingo is everything expected in this role. His superb singing and masculine physique are a perfect match. As for Katia's Desdemona, she is a great singer and beautiful woman (for an opera singer, of course). Justino Diaz's Iago is as evil and vile as Shakespeare wrote of him. The music along with actually shooting in Europe make a wonderfully complete picture for this masterpiece. Even the opening sequence is visual, unlike the usual staged productions. Real combat, emotion and staging are quite effective.",
