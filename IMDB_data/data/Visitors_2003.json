        "reviewBody": "First of all, 'Visitors, The' is not a common thriller. Far from that, the movie tells us a story about the rendezvous of a young yacht-woman (Mitchell)in a solitaire voyage around the world in a little boat with her own problems, griefs, fear and misunderstandings of a whole life. In this process, her mind derived away in a dangerous way, in which she is confronted with hallucinations involving her deceased parents, a strange lover and even her only companion in the trip - a cat named 'Taco' - starts to 'talk' to her. Good premise, even an intelligent one, but the movie lacks an indispensable deepness that the story must claim. Because of that, the result is a bit too contrived, not passionate or challenging. In fact, after some time in front of the TV, you'll feel a certain disappointment because a good idea was just mistreated. Radha Mitchell is good but her competence and her beauty are not strong enough to make this one a remarkable movie.",
