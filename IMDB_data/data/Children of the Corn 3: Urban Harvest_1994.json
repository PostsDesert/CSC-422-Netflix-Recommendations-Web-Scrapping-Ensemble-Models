One takes to his new surroundings well and begins to make friends while his younger brother continues his loyalty to \"He who behinds behind the rows\"\n\nFor a start I was glad of the new setting, however it quickly became apparent that they really weren't going to utilize it.\n\nEli becomes yet another child preacher and alike those before him is obnoxious and plays his well really well.\n\nThe film itself plays out basically exactly as you'd expect. Religion, a few deaths and an \"Ultimate showdown\" at the end.\n\nNot good, not bad, just more of the same when by all rights it should have been really quite different.\n\nThe Good:\n\nFollows on quite well\n\nThe Bad:\n\nNothing exactly stands out\n\nSome ropey sfx at the end\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nCorn cross, corn bible, whole things getting a bit corny",
