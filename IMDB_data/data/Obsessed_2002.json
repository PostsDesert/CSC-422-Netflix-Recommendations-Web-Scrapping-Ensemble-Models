        "reviewBody": "Surprisingly, for a Lifetime movie, this was really watchable. Not great, necessarily but definitely watchable. The fetching Jenna Elfman plays a woman accused of harassing a handsome doctor. As the plot kicks in and the point of view switches from Jenna's seemingly normal medical writer to the doctor we learn that the young lady isn't all she seems to be. Handled in a really mature character-oriented fashion instead of the usually hysterical overly zealous admirer-from hell manner. And Jenna's really got acting chops!",
