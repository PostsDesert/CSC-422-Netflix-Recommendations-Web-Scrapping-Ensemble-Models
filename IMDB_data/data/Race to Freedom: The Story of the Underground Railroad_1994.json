        "reviewBody": "True, there is a number of clichés in this movie and yet the overall result is moving. Canadians are not particularly well aware of this relatively short part (about 11 years) of their history and this movie does not stray too far from the harsh reality it describes. Perhaps it is the saving grace of clichés: like stereotypes, they tend to have a good foundation in reality. I don't know for sure for the Canadian \"Birdwatcher\" but for the rest, it does jib well with what I know from reliable sources. So, if you want to present the \"Underground Railroad\" to someone not already familiar with it, it is a very good, enjoyable, introduction.\n\nOne caveat, the sound track does not seem correct with large volume variations adding to the difficulties in understanding strong accents. Also, the lack of closed-caption (or any subtitle) will not help you either. A better language support-sound track would have certainly improved its rating.",
