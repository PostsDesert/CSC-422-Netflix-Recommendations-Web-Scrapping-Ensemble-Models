        "reviewBody": "An extremely high percentage of the topics covered on \"The American Experience\" are ones that you seldom hear about otherwise. Marcus Garvey, Nellie Bly, Minik the Eskimo and the Greely Expedition are just a few topics covered in the shows that you'll rarely hear about otherwise. However, a few times, the show talks about events that have been covered a lot, but this isn't a problem because in most cases the show did a better job of it that you'd see on other documentaries and films. This is definitely the case with \"The Battle of the Bulge: World War II's Deadliest Battle\". There are several films about it (including \"Battleground\" and \"The Battle of the Bulge\") and MANY documentaries (the History Channel seems to talk about it every week), but none are as complete and compelling as this show--though I do applaud \"Battleground\" for giving a good account of the soldiers' personal experiences in this awful battle.\n\nAs you'd expect, the show is filled with lots of great interviews with various survivors, lots of stock footage and excellently written and delivered narration. It's top-notch all around and did a good job of conveying the sort of hellish fight that the battle entailed. Well worth seeing--and a great reminder of the sacrifices our vets have made.",
