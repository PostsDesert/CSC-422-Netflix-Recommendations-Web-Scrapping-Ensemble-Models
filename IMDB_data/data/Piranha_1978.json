Turns out it's not bad, and better than I expected.\n\nStarts very well - setting the scene, developing the plot and characters. There is a genuine feeling of intrigue and engagement. You keep thinking \"How are they going to stop this?\".\n\nFrom a point, however, it does degenerate into a B-grade creature feature, with action, body count and gore being the main drivers. It also feels like a bad ripoff of Jaws.\n\nHowever, for the most part it is reasonably enjoyable and worth the watch.",
