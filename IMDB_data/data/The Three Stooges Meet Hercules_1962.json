        "reviewBody": "The Three Stooges Meet Hercules (1962) was another theatrical film that the aging \"Three Stooges\" did for their new generation of fans. Having to tone down the physicality of their slapstick humor, the Stooges had to use a lot more verbal exchanges than they have did in the past. The three lovable geezers work in a pharmacy. Theie boss is a swell guy but he's also a spineless creep. A freak accident causes all of them to travel back to Ancient Greece and create all kinds of havoc. Several questions are raised (aren't there always). How did they wind up traveling backwards in time? Who will greet them in Ancient Greece. Where do they wind up at? How can they communicate to the natives if they speak ancient Greek? To find out the answers to these earth shaking questions then you'll have to watch THE THREE STOOGES MEET HERCULES!!!\n\nRecommended for die-hard geriatric Three Stooges fans.",
