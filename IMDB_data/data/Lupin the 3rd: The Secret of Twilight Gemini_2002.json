Dulune asks Lupin a favor in seeking out the treasure for him before he departs from this world.\n\nAfter all the years Lupin's had with Dulune, he couldn't refuse a request from an old friend when it involves treasure. So he heads towards Morocco only to be tracked by a group of Assassins and a tribe that want the treasure for themselves. And will kill off anyone who gets in the way. With the help of Lupin's friends and a group of rebels, this won't be as boring of an adventure as it turns out to be.\n\nI didn't get why some people hate this one so much at first. And I kept hearing it was the worst Lupin TV movie of all time. But I can tell it's because it focuses on Lupin a lot and very little screen time on his comrades than the previous ones. Besides that, I think it was very good. It had allot of funny parts, action, and had more nudity in any Lupin anime.\n\nThis is a fun and enjoyable movie to watch. You can't get anything wrong with Lupin the 3rd.\n\nThose who like Lupin the 3rd can check this one out. If you're not sure whether you'd like or not, just rent it and see.",
