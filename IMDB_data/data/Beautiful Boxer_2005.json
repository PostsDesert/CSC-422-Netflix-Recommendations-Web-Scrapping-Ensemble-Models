I thought a lot more people were understanding in the choice she made and showed that the Thai culture is very understanding. I felt sorry for her, however, when she fought the Japanese professional wrestler because it seemed like more of publicity stunt than a real fight which I think hurt her reputation with the people.\n\nOverall I thought it was a great film and really shows that you can follow through with anything you want to.",
