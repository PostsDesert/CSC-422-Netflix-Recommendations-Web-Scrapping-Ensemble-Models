        "reviewBody": "This is my favorite movie musical with no stage forebear.\n\nConsider what's in the mix: A cachet of songs, all tried-and-true from other movies. A cast that was at the top of its form, all the way from Kelly himself to the supporting leads played by Rita Moreno and Millard Mitchell. A script that is, at once, romantic and exciting and sharp and funny.\n\nStir together with a generous heaping of MGM color and a dash of a director with a stellar pedigree and the result is, well, something like \"Singin' in the Rain.\"\n\nThere's not a misstep in the movie's entire 103-minute running time. I love the pokes at early filmmaking (\"She never *did* figure out where that microphone was, boss!\") and the sheer energy of the musical numbers (\"Fit as a Fiddle,\" \"Good Mornin'\").\n\nNot only that, but there's not a more romantic scene in all of filmdom that can compare with Reynolds and Kelly dancing to \"You Were Meant for Me.\" Their side-by-side tap dancing says more about how they feel about each other than pages and pages of dialog.\n\nGreat stuff!\n\nIf you think this movie is just the sequence of Kelly splashing like a five-year-old in a puddle, you obviously haven't seen the entire film. Do so--now! You won't regret it!\n\nPS: In the \"rent-this-too\" category, if you've seen and love \"Singin' in the Rain,\" check out \"The Band Wagon.\" It skewers the world of theater in much the same way as this film roasts Hollywood!"
