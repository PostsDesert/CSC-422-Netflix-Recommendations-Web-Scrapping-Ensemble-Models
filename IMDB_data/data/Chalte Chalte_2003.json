There are brief tedious patches when Shahrukh Khan and Rani are not on screen but those are few and far between. The story is very everyday -boy meets girl, falls instantly in love and wooes successfully this girl who is bit out of his world. But the Shahrukh charm is such that one wonders how she could have contemplated even for a week the thought of marrying some other chap even if she knew him from childhood. Delightful wooing scenes, lovely songs, very charming and sexy marriage episodes followed by quarrels. These are so believable that the audience is left gasping at the audacity of the rows. Luckily a happy ending and one is left feeling good and satisfied. I shall be very disappointed if SRK does not win every award for this year's best acting. Cant wait to see other Shahrukh films due this year."
