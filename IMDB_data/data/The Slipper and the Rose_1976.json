The musical score is excellent and the scenery and setting capture the moment. There are lots of great performances, particularly Julian Orchard as the Prince's cousin, and the cast list is full of British actors of calibre (plus Richard Chamberlain of course who does a good job of disguising his American accent). This is a really good family movie and has a great twist to the traditional Cinderella story."
