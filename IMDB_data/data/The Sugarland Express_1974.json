She had been quite respectable in \"Butterflies Are Free\" in 1972, but she turned in a beautifully nuanced performance in this one.\n\nI would certainly argue with any notion that this film is \"underrated\". It's always been well regarded, even back in the days when Spielberg was known as the clever kid who made \"Jaws\". That doesn't mean it has ever been easy to see.\n\nNow, with the passage of time, \"Sugarland Express\" looks even better than it did in the 1970's. One still has no trouble at all getting caught up in the quixotic mission of these characters.",
