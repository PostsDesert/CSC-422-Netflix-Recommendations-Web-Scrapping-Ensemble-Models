It's basically a good old 'feelgood' movie.\n\nThe films saving grace is it has two amazing songs in it (Star and House) from writer Ray Loverock, who was in the band Northstar.\n\nFollowing the split of Northstar, he is now in one of the UKs hottest new bands called We Love You i've dug around and found out.\n\nIf you love his songs in the movie go check out this brilliant new band right now, their songs are absolutley amazing, this is the most exciting band i've heard in years.\n\nI'm keeping track of the band via their site for info on where you can buy their music when they have a release.\n\nPeter O'Toole makes the film with his charasmatic presence.\n\nGo check out the film, and the music of We Love You."
