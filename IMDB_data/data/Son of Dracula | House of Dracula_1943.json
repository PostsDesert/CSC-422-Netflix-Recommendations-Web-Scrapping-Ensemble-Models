        "reviewBody": "I thought Lon Chaney, Jr. was a terrible casting choice. He was hardly menacing with a tremendously dull character and with no sophistication. Dracula is supposed to be from Transylvania but he sounded like he was from the mid-western U.S. He even looked dull, not like a villain or even a leading man. The special effects were top notch for the time period and the sets were wonderfully moody and mysterious. The male costuming was good but the female costuming was excellent with flowing dresses. Actually, I am surprised that the censors allowed the very sensual dresses. The whole \"Alucard\" idea was slightly interesting but they should have stuck with the classic story. The cinematography for indoor scenes was flat but the outside scenes were the most attractive.\n\nThe movie was not scary but was moderately interesting.",
