This film is one of the best I've seen this year. It is a quiet, beautiful character study which doesn't rely upon or need glitz or flash. The depths of these characters could not be explored without the even, thoughtful performances of Sutherland and Sedgwick. I watched the DVD twice as a rental then looked high & low to find it for sale with no luck until I convinced my local video store to sell a rental copy to me. Don't miss an opportunity to see this film!",
