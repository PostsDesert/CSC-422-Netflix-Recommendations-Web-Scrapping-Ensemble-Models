He wishes to speak with the leaders of the earth, all of them, but that is impossible, So he escapes and makes his way to a boarding house, where he can learn about humans.\n\nIt's a great cast, including Patricia Neal and Sam Jaffe as the smartest man in the world Like all serious science fiction movies, it has an Important Message. Unlike many of them, it never disguises that this movie is about its message, about the need to learn to live together in peace. Robert Wise, that great generalist of a director, does his usual impeccable job. While seventy years later it may seem stentorian and naive, it is those two two qualities that make it still worth watching.",
