The movie is a mess and a huge disappointment. There are some other famous names relied to this movie, except from Pacino. Kim Basinger and Ryan O'Neal (the guy we now from \"Love Story\") are also starring this movie, as well as Téa Leoni.\n\nWhat the director was trying to say wasn't bad, the point he wanted to make was good, but the way he has done it wasn't good at all. I don't see why Al Pacino has chosen to play this role, but as a true Pacino fan, I think this was the worst movie I've ever seen him in.\n\nNot exactly worth watching.\n\n5/10",
