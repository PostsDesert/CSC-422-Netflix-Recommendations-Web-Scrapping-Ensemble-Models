It's just dark, or something. I'd probably blame it on the PD, though that's a guess.\n\nRegardless, the screenplay is decent, the acting is excellent, and the direction / editing is strong, non-boring, and lacking in most of the typical cliches that you would expect from this genre. This is not a classic, not something I want to watch more than once, but a totally engaging and entertaining action flick that didn't once insult my intelligence. \n\nI give it a solid seven stars."
