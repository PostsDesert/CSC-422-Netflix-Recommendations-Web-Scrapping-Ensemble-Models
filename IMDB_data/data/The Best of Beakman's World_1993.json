He falls for a girl at his school who is in a loving family where the dad is almost never home either.\n\nBoth children have emotional scars and just fall in love with one another. I don't want to give away the twists but it is well worth seeing since it helps understand mental health issues and scars are not only for adults.\n\nIt is an emotional drama well worth seeing but \n\nThere is some unclear stuff in the plot that is left pretty much to interpretation and is the reason I only give it an 8.",
