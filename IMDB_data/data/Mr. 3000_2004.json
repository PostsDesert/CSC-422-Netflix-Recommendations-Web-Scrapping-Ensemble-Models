        "reviewBody": "Enjoyed this film primarily because of the great acting of Bernie Mac,\"Guess Who\", and his girlfriend in the film, Angela Bassett,(Maureen \"Mo\" Simmons),\"Sunshine State\". Bernie plays the role of a super baseball player who winds up having to prove himself all over again in the eyes of the Hall of Fame Judges. There are plenty of laughs and some very warm and sexy scenes with \"Mo\" who plays a CNN News reporter who has interviews with Bernie and has a quick tongue in response to his remarks about being in love and wanting to tie the knot. If it were not for the above mentioned actors, this film would have fallen completely on its head. Thanks Bernie Mac !",
