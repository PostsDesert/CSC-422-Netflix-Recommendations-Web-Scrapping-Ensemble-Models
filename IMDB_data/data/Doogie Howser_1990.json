LAW, NYPD Blue and Hill Street Blues, Doogie Houser, MD was a wonderfully funny with a touch of life. As a 30 something adult when I first watched Doogie in late night reruns, I was hooked by its' humor and wit while watching this \"kid\" with a adult mind, yet the hormones and maturity of a teenager, grow into independence. Memorable episodes include his first day, the late night skinny dip (as mentioned by another viewer), the practical joke he played on other hospital staff only to have it ruthlessly reciprocated, and the apartment with his best friend Vinny. There is some risqu√© humor but it is nothing when compared to today's standards. I always enjoyed seeing the relationship he had with his dad(James Sikking) and mom(Belinda Montgomery). I had the entire series recorded but sacrificed them for NFL games. BIG mistake!! Doogie Houser, MD will long be cherished by this now 40 something dad and his now 20 something daughters. I look forward to seeing Doogies journal again."
