The Dolby Digital music which this DVD is set to makes this one of the most relaxing videos you could ever watch. As a previous poster said, this is not necessarily a movie, but more of a background video. I can't describe the images on this DVD and do them justice. You just simply have to get it and see for yourself. You'll have philosophical and religious experiences when you watch this. It's the best thing you could watch if you have had a long/hard day. Simply put this in your DVD player, kick back and you'll immediately realize that the problems you think are huge are insignificant; and you'll feel better about everything.",
