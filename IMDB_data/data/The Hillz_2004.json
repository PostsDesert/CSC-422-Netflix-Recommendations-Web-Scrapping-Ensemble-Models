To see her, I had to endure 91 minutes of the most juvenile dialog that I have ever experienced. 45 minutes was used to repeat \"fuck\" over and over. The rest of the time was lame 13-year-old comments about \"how big a pussy you are, man.\" The only remotely funny bit was the story of \"Monster Head.\" Paris, I am so over you now. This was it. I swear to all that is holy that I will never again subject myself to seeing any moving that you appear in - not even \"1 Night in Paris.\" Go play with the elephants or something. You are ancient history.\n\nCan you believe that someone had the nerve to compare this to Pulp Fiction and A Clockwork Orange? That is the ultimate in creative marketing. They should be shot!",
