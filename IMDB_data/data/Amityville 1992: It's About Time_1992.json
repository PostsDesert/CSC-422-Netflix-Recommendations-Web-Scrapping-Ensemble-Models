        "reviewBody": "It's certainly about time that this series had a hit, and with Amityville 1992: Its About Time, we have one!\n\nThis sixth entry ignores whatever The Amityville Curse was doing and continues the theme of the fourth film which involves cursed items from the infamous house being sold off to new owners. Here we have a possessed clock which has been purchased by the head of the family named Jacob . Once Jacob brings the clock into his house, we start to see the Amityville evil take over him and other members of his family.\n\nJacob gets bitten by a rabid neighbourhood dog which is when he starts to become possessed and physically dangerous to everyone around him.. After the clock kills a few people and possesses family members, it's up to Jacob's girlfriend Andrea to try and figure out what is happening and how the clock plays into how everything around her and the family is falling apart.\n\nThe acting is very well done by all. Stephen Macht and Shawn Weatherly are absolutely terrific as the dysfunctional couple. Macht has the job of playing the possessed abusive male lead and he certainly is terrifying! Shawn Weatherly as Andrea is a wonderful heroine which I rooted for to survive the entire time. Jonathan Penner provides comic relief in the later half as Andrea's side piece, trying to adapt to the craziness happening around him.\n\nThis film also gives us some really effective special effects, including a very realistic dog bite and a melting face to name a few stand out moments. It provides scares in a very fun way, some predictable stuff but entertaining nonetheless. The director likes to trick the audience numerous times in thinking that one horrific thing is happening when in fact it is not.\n\nAmityville 1992: It's About Time is for sure my favourite sequel of the series. It provides scares, pretty decent special effects, and a story that connects this film to the original two while also making viewers entertained throughout.The evil clock has the ability to move time forward and backwards at a rapid pace which I found really well done, and it starts to control time in the home. I definitely recommend this one to any horror fan. It's a fun sequel that doesn't disappoint on the fun and cheesiness meter.\n\n7/10",
