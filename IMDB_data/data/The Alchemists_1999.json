It also seems that they've cut dialogue and other information to save time, because there are a lot of odd and jump cuts. And how pathetic the characters sounded saying \"Sorry!\" whenever someone was pronounced dead. This is BOUND for Mystery Science Theater 3000... too bad it was cancelled.\n\nI'm sure the good votes this got, was from cast members, investors, or friends of cast members, and investors.",
