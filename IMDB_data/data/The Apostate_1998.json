        "reviewBody": "I recently saw this movie, and I enjoyed it and would encourage others to see it. In the movie, a priest/artist (Richard Grieco) goes to Puerto Rico after he's found out that his brother who's a gay prostitute was brutally murdered. The movie also stars Dennis Hopper who plays an athiest psycho killer, a role he's all to familiar with. The supporting cast is good not great, but they add to the film nicely. The music that underlays the film is haunting voices, breaths, and church music. This is a great mystery/thriller and it's definitely worth seeing.",
