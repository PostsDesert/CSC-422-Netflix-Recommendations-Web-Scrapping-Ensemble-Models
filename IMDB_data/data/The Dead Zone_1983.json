        "reviewBody": "If Hollywood could get back to maving good honest movies like this. You know the sort of movie. One that you can go to the cinema, pay your money and be entertained by a good story unspoiled by ugly CGI effect and mediocre TV actors who think they're A listers.\n\nI watched Dead Zone after trying to tackle Cronenberg's Cosmpopolis having already seen the movie back in the 90's. I think I wanted to just check if Cronenberg really did make The Dead Zone and it was as good as I thought it was after seeing the turkey Cosmopolis.\n\nMy curiosity was confirmed. The Dead Zone was a good old fashioned horror thriller, intellectually provoking, great cinematography, great acting from all especially Walken who rarely disappoints. Is it too much to ask that Hollywood goes back to doing what they were always able to do very well? Probably!\n\nThe story is about a man who attains psychic abilities after 5 years in a coma due to a car crash. From that point Walken finds himself in various scenarios where his new super powers are put to the test. Martin Sheen hams it up as the nasty presidential candidate. I found the movie, sad in places, at times exciting and also thought provoking. Not as much gore as we normally see from Cronenberg but this was a mainstream production, probably the only one of two he made in that bracket, the other being The Fly. \n\nThe Dead Zone had all the ingredients of a good movie and I guess that's why it stands the test of time. I wonder who will remember Cosmopolis?",
