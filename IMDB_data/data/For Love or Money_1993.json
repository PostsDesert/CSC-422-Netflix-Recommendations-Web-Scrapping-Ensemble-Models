He meets a guy who is keen to help but things get complicated when Doug discovers that his new found friend and financial helper is going out with the girl who he has been after for months (Anwar).\n\nThe outcome of this movie is no surprise and the love/hate relationship and chemistry between Fox and Anwar is very entertaining.\n\nOverall an enjoyable film for all ages.",
