Eventually I found myself looking to see when it was on again and watching it every time. This movie is a definite \"send-up\" to all those campy movies we either loved or hated, and this movie is definitely in the \"love-it or hate it\" category. Give yourself enough heads up to be up for anything and you too will add this to your \"must see's\" of cult classics. Most of the actors are unknown, some you may recognize from various TV shows. the story line is quirky at times but the cast works well together to pull this off.",
