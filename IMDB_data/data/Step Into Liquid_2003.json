Surf's up dude! Surfing enthusiast cum documentarian Dana Brown, son of filmmaker Bruce Brown who helmed the sport's quintessential flicks 'The Endless Summer' and 'The Endless Summer 2', picks up from his dad about the way of life for the thrill-seeking, daredevil and nature worshipping oceanographers of waycool as they embark on a globetrotting look at the awesome spectacle of catching a wave without it catching you! Jaw-dropping cinematography of 60 foot avalanches of ocean's crests glistening in glass clear blue water off Oahu, Ireland (!) and such exotic locales as Rapu Nui , Vietnam and Sheboygan, Wisconsin (!!!) Truly amazing for those uninitiated and for purists there is no substitute in realizing that it's a style of life and not a lifestyle. The real-life surfers show unbridled passion at what makes it all worth while Â– enjoying something you love; what's not to admire about that 'philosophy'."
