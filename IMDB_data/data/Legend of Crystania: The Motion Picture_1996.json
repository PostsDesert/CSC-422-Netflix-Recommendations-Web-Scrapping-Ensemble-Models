        "reviewBody": "For fans of Lodoss you may be a little disappointed as this film, although telling the story of Ashrams journey following the end of Lodoss, heroic knight, the story centres around a new set of characters and there is no real reference at all to the events of Lodoss. The animation is different to anything I have seen before and made a nice change to watch something a little different to most other anime, although a little lacking in detail its very distinctive with always a lot of colour in most scenes. Great story with great character designs and interesting plot twists to keep things moving. \n\nThe only fault for me was that the running time at 85 minutes is a little short and I think more time to develop a few of the characters and the land they were in would be good as with all fantasy there is usually a lot of history and legends before the story making the world feel a little more real. Whether your a fan of Lodoss or not you don't need to have seen it to enjoy this, if you enjoy fantasy with swords fighting and magic you'll like this.",
