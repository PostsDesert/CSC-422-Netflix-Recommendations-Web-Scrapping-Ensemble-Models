The only reason I put up with this, these three 'episodes' were effectively on their own and were referred to briefely in the series (well, 2 of them were).\n\nIt ends up that I was half right. after searching, I found out that it isn't three episodes strung together, but currently there are some 6 digimon 'movies' released in Japan, and three of them are in this single movie that we saw in the western world. It seems that the Japanese form of a movie is 30 minutes long (how this works is beyond me).\n\nOutside that, it was enjoyable. I had fun watching it, taping it and watching it again, and catching all the jokes they had. It's what makes the series enjoyable, and it sure saved the movie.",
