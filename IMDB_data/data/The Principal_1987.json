        "reviewBody": "The school teacher Rick Latimer (James Belushi) is drinking with friends in a bar when he sees his former wife dating her lawyer responsible for their divorce. Rick smashes up the car of the lawyer, is arrested and the school board sends him to the notorious Brandel High School as an alternative to be fired. Without any other option, Rick moves and finds a school dominated by gangs with students rejected from other schools. He joins the students and tells no more for that situation. The chief of the security Jake Phillips (Louis Gossett Jr.) believes Rick is crazy but soon he supports the principal attitudes. But the drug lord Victor Duncan (Michael Wright) is not happy with the new principal and promises to kill him.\n\n\"The Principal\" is that type of movie for fans of films like \"To Sir with Love\", \"Class of 1984\" and \"Dangerous Minds\", where a teacher faces difficulties in a problematic high-school with the students dominated by gangs. James Belushi performs one of his best roles as Rick Latimer, a school teacher that has destroyed all opportunities in life and now has no other option but stay at the notorious Brandel High School. Louis Gossett Jr. is also excellent as the chief of the security guards in the dangerous high-school. The plot might be unrealistic in the present violent days but in the 80Â´s it would be credible. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Um Diretor Contra Todos\" (\"A Principal against Everybody\")",
