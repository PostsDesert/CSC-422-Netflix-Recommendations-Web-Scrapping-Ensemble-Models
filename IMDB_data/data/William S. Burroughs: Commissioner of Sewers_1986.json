        "reviewBody": "This documentary on the famed experimental writer, directed by Klaus (DECODER) Maeck, is of value mostly to fans, although it may kindle some interest in the uninitiated. Nowhere near as in-depth as Howard Brookner's BURROUGHS: THE MOVIE, the film focuses on interviews with Burroughs and scenes of him giving public readings, with a concentration on THE WESTERN LANDS. For me, the most memorable bit was Burroughs talking about evolution and space travel. Could have been longer and have more extensive info (I assume Maeck was on a budget), but fans will not really complain."
