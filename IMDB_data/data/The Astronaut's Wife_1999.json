        "name": "Eerie and thrilling film about a pair of shuttle astronauts return Earth with unexpected consequences",
        "reviewBody": "It deals with a space shuttle in orbit and two astronauts leave their spacecraft to carry out a routine mission : to repair a damaged satellite when there's an explosion , later on they forced to go back Earth after NASA loses contact for two mysterious minutes . Astronauts Spencer Armacost (Johnny Depp) and Alex Streck (Nick Cassavetes) were outside the spacecraft when the surprising incident happened. But they aren't the same guys after they go back from a nearly fatal accident . Armacost seems to be unaffected ; however , his wife Jillian (Charlize Theron) , a Florida school teacher , feels weird activities and subtle changes in him . Over time , Armacost's unsettling mistress Jillian to be afraid of his strange behaviour . As his obsession knows no bounds and he becomes increasingly violent , putting Jillian's life in danger . As he begins to threaten her with possesive and violent acts . Egged on by a previous NASA employee (Joe Morton) , the fiercely strongwilled woman starts to believe that her husband is something else . Jillian also learns that she is pregnant , as time progresses she begins to feel like the lives inside of her are not of this world . Look at this \"man\" and Beware! There is nothing human about him except his desires! See The Thing Without A Face . How well do you know the one you love? Imagine the face of terror is the one you love . Witness the birth of pure evil.\n\nLong in atmosphere but short on momentum and plot , the meandering script is fleshed out by nuanced performances . Ravich's decent filmmaking fills the antiseptic interiors of the marriage's Manhattan designer apartment with a terrifying menace , but regrettably the slow-burn intrigue is extinguished when too much is revealed at just the wrong moment . The picture blends Sci-fi/horror themes , taking parts here and there of extraterrestrial invasion as ¨Species¨ adding terrifying moments , as Charlize Teron is also very much like her beleagured wife in ¨The devil's advocate¨since everyone seems to think Jillian's nuts , as well as things get very ¨Rosemary's Baby¨ style . Charlize Theron gives a passable acting as a disturbing woman who becomes pregnant with twins from a strange astronaut , holding doubts if carrying extraterrestrial parasites , she is by turns , sympathetically unhinged and vulnerable . While Johnny Depp is really creepy and disturbing as an astronaut with dark purports. As Johnny Depp is more credible in quirky characters in quirky films .Remaining support cast is pretty good , such as Nick Cassavetes , Donna Murphy , Clea Duvall , Samantha Eggar , Tom Noonan , Gary Grubbs , Blair Brown , among others .\n\nIt contains a moving and nail-biting musical score by George S. Clinton with plenty of thrilling and suspenseful moments . As well as colorful and adequate cinematography by recently deceased Allen Daviau . The motion picture was professionally made by Rand Ravich , though with no originality and it has some flaws and gaps . This is his only film but he has written/produced TV series as Crisis , Second chance , Time tunnel and Life . Rating : 5.5/10 . Passable and acceptable Science-Fiction/Horror movie",
