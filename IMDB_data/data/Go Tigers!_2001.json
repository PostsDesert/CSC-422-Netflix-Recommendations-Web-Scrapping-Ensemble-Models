I love how you all come on here to support your town, that's super. You have a multi-million dollar football complex. You have a live tiger as a mascot. You get $5+ a head for admission for games not to mention the profits from concessions. Yet you need to tax your citizens to keep the school out of debt? As one player commented \"They wont pass it because we had a losing record\" Holding back a CHILD so they can be bigger and stronger for a game is a shame and the parents of those CHILDREN should be publicly humiliated for their complete lack of respect for education. While it may seem harsh of me to be saying these things it's all too true in many small towns across America. I think that was the point this doc was trying get across and it did a wonderful job. PS--I love the shot of the big jock puking up a beer bong then asking for another beer.",
