Nothing but a bunch of mismatched stereotypes from a whole list of teenage angst films, all vomited together.\n\nThe only moment worth watching was this one \"kind of funny\" scene where Danica McKellar confronts the main kid. Mascara running down cheeks, etc. She totally pulled it off.\n\nBut seriously, she wasn't in the movie that much, and it wasn't worth watching the whole movie for. Stay AWAY...!\n\nI'm just tired of all the bad films out there. PLEASE entertain us!"
