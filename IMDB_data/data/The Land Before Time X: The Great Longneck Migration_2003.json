This was made in 2003, after 16 years (1988 - 2004) there is still more the land before time movies coming out, THE LAND BEFORE TIME = 1988 THE LAND BEFORE TIME 2: THE GREAT VALLEY ADVENTURE 1994 THE LAND BEFORE TIME 3: THE TIME OF THE GREAT GIVING = 1995 THE LAND BEFORE TIME 4: JOURNEY THROUGH THE MISTS = 1996 THE LAND BEFORE TIME 5: THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND = 1997 THE LAND BEFORE TIME 6: THE SECRET OF SAURUS ROCK = 1998 THE LAND BEFORE TIME 7: THE STONE OF COLD FIRE 2000 THE LAND BEFORE TIME 8: THE BIG FREEZE = 2001 THE LAND BEFORE TIME 9: JOURNEY TO BIG WATER = 2002 THE LAND BEFORE TIME 10: THE GREAT LONGNECK MIGRATION = 2003\n\nYet there is more the land before time movies to be released.\n\nTHE LAND BEFORE TIME 11 = 2004\n\nThe 11th title has been rumoured with a title called: INVADING THE TINYSAURUS. Also one of the cast has rumoured that THE LAND BEFORE TIME 12 is in the greenlit. I have enjoyed watching the 10th installment of the land before time. I am looking forward to see the 11th title when it does come out, hopefully in December as there has been no news just yet on the land before time 11. Hopefully there will be some news. I give THE LAND BEFORE TIME 10. 10 OUT OF 10.",
