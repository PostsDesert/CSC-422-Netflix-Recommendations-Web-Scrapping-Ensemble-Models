Treat Williams was especially good, but he always is. Too many reviewers compare this movie with others, saying it is weaker for one reason or another. Don't compare movies like this - that's not what a review is for. A movie should stand on its own merits. I honestly think these people are just trying to show how many similar movies they've seen because it makes them feel better informed and smarter than the average reviewer. Guess what? They're not!"
