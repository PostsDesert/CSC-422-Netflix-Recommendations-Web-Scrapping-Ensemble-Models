In the end, I felt that the director (if he can really call himself one) left far too many loose threads than should be allowed.\n\nThe premise of the movie didn't make much sense, either. The way it started off was pretty lame. Following 'Telal' from his 'escape,' if you can call it that, made no sense. Having Selena conveniently explain stuff didn't make it any easier to swallow, either. The superstitious mumbo jumbo didn't make the movie any more interesting, it just provided more of a convenient vehicle to drag it out.\n\nOverall, a really bad movie. I think it lowered my IQ several points! I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.\n\nMay Telal be a curse upon this horrid movie!",
