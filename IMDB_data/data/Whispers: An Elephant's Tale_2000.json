Kids don't care if the plot and theme have been overdone. They don't care if the voices and the animal movement done sync up perfectly, although I actually think they did a pretty good job with this movie. I am actually always impressed when anyone can pull off a movie like this with wild animals. In fact, although I've seen lots of movies with cats, dogs, cows, etc. I haven't seen many with what are essentially wild animals, even if they'r from a zoo. I don't know where or how they filmed this, but I thought they did a great job, and again, my kids love this movie. It's definitely oriented toward kids, it's not too scary and it's got just enough action in it. I totally disagree with the harsh reviews above, and I'm not an easy sell. It's perfect for young ones.",
