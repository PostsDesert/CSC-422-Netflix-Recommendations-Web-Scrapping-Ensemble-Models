        "reviewBody": "Enjoyed this TV series starring Charles Bronson as Paul Fein and in this particular series I enjoyed him even more. Bronson played his role to perfection and acted like a professional cop who had almost served 40 years of service. In this picture Paul Fein is investigating different aspects of a banker's death, as well as, Ben Fein, (Joe Penny) and the fact that their is corruption in the police department and even the Mayor of the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin where this film is suppose to take place. One of his daughter's is expecting a child and the father of the baby does not want to marry her, so she is going to raise the child as a single mom with all the family supporting her. There is plenty of action with bullets flying all over the place and car chases over a bridge that opens up. It was great seeing this picture with Charles Bronson at the age of 77 years making a great TV series as a final swan song, he sure was a great actor and I am glad he was able to keep acting which was the love of his life.",
