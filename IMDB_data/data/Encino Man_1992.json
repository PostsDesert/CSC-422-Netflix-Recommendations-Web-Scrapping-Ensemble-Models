This one, along with \"Bio-Dome\", is an okay movie, or maybe even good. Then it starts going downhill from \"Son-in-Law\" to \"Jury Duty\" and we try to forget everything else. Shore was sort of a one-note joke, and because he was not able to grow beyond that, he kind of faded away.\n\nThis film works well because Fraser captures the caveman thing really well, but even more so it is Sean Astin who saves the day. By playing the straight man, he keeps the Fraser-Shore antics grounded, and his role should not be understated.",
