The story was a little simple, i think the writers should have made it have more depth and intensity , although the ending was not one i expected totally. Diego Luna was TO DIE FOR. He was absolutely an amazing actor and dancer and i am so proud of them for learning to dance for this movie.\n\nThis movie left me so jelious of his British co-star and made me want to go to Cuba and also learn to dance. I got the soundtrack from the movie, its amazing. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good time. It neglects to finish properly, and leaves you wanting more, but seeing Diego Luna act made me want to watch all of his other movies."
