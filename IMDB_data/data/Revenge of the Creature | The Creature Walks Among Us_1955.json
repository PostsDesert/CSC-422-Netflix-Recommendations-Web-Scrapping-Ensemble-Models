        "reviewBody": "Well, I've seen worse, lots worse. In its favor, the movie still features one of the coolest (and best implemented) monster designs ever to emerge from the old B&W films of that era, and the underwater photography is still quite arresting - apparently the actor in the creature costume was capable of holding his breath underwater for incredible amounts of time, and so the creature looks entirely at home and natural in the water. \n\nAgainst it? A weak screen play where nothing interesting happens for almost 30 minutes in two different parts of the movie. Some of the worst movie dialog actors have ever been forced to utter (I can just imagine how John \"I worked with John Wayne once\" Agar must have died inside while trying to deliver some of his bon-mots.) A distinct lack of chemistry between Agar and Lori Nelson and a screen play that does nothing to give them anything to draw them together (except for the old \"you are so \"the only person around\" problem). \n\nWorse, the creature himself seems over-exposed here. Since the movie yanks him out of his creepy, isolated, backwater lagoon in the first 15 minutes, he loses the mystery and most of his menace from his original surroundings once he is moved to his bright, shiny Sea World. After that, he's just a good costume and a set of talons. \n\nThe guy who wrote \"Keep Watching The Skies\" remarked about \"Revenge Of the Creature\" that the only good things about this sequel are the elements they kept from the first one. I'd have to agree that this is about right - everything the film makers tried to add and expand on in the sequel just didn't really click. \n\nStill, as a little kid, this would have been great fun.",
