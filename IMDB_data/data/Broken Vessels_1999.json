The performances are riveting and the depiction of generational drug abuse is something of which to take notice.\n\nThose that think this dumps on the EMT profession, need to get real. What? You think that there are no abusers in this field of work? In fact, the one time I had to ride in a \"bus,\" the EMT was starting an IV and I said \"you guys haven't been cruising the park before coming here, have you?\" He started laughing and told me how much he loved this film.\n\nOf course, these guys could have been in any profession, but the superior irony would have been lost. This is one drug film I can recommend without hesitation, as it is chilling and stark. It in no way \"glamorizes\" drug use or the culture.",
