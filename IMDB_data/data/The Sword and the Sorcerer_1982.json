        "reviewBody": "I'm sorry that a sequel was never made of The Sword And The Sorcerer. It was fairly obvious that Lee Horsley got caught up with his Matt Houston series at the time. This one was a very well done fantasy adventure.\n\nLee Horsley plays Talon deprived of his rightful place as king by evil usurper Richard Lynch who employs the black arts of sorcery to conquer the kingdom run by Horsley's father. Talon who is a child at the time flees, but grows up to be an adventurer medieval soldier of fortune with one nasty triple sword that actually fires two of its blades like a spring, the better to take care of more than one adversary.\n\nIn the meantime brother and sister Simon MacCorkindale and Kathleen Beller are having Richard Lynch now threaten their domain. Of course it is the mysterious Horsley that comes to their aid.\n\nLynch of whom I can't think of playing any good guys in his career is as evil as they come. Soon after resurrecting a wizard to help him in his quest, he kills the same wizard played by Richard Moll. But the sorcerer is far from done with him.\n\nAnd there's George Maharis a mysterious nobleman with his own agenda involving the kingdom.\n\nHorsley cut quite the romantic medieval figure and Kathleen Beller is a beautiful doe eyed princess who knows exactly where men are vulnerable in protecting her virtue. Nice special effects also characterize The Sword And The Sorcerer. I wish Horsley had done more films with his Talon character.",
