Thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nThe agony and hilarity of parents as empty nesters and the lengths they go to to see their children!\n\nIt is a familiar complaint but so cleverly depicted the selfishness of children, the parents unwillingness to let go.\n\nThe family dynamic was excellent. The opening scene when the children left the home I was emotional but afterwards I literally laughed out loud.\n\nHaving children at this juncture in my life and feeling the same way I could relate.",
