I rented the movie several times before finally buying it.\n\nThe scenes at the Chinese restaurant have to rank up there with the all-time greatest in comedy (\"no fighting in restaurant -- cost you extra to fight in restaurant\").\n\nThe movie did start to slow after Rushon gets shot in the leg and goes to the hospital. But before that, gosh, it had to be the funniest movie I've seen in years! I give it 8 out of 10."
