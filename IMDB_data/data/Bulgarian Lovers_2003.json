        "reviewBody": "The movie is not only terribly boring, but it is a pain to watch: BANAL, BIASED, NO STORY, NO MEANING. It is a good idea for any director to first study the culture and mentality of a country before staining the name of a whole nation. The representation of Bulgaria is simplistic and one-sided. No doubt any Bulgarian would feel deeply offended by such distorted representation of his country. Second, the movie is more than explicit when it comes to male nudity. Nobody would mind to see a couple of passionate love scenes, but it is beyond the call of duty to have Dritan Beba (by the name of Kiril in the movie) walk around naked all or most of the time. Finally, the movie is simply dragging since there is really nothing happening. Even though the actors are believable in their personification of homosexuals, they are simply not convincing when it comes to human emotion. As a whole, the movie is a complete waste. I couldn't finish watching it and I guess nobody in his right mind would unless he's desperate to see gay porn.",
