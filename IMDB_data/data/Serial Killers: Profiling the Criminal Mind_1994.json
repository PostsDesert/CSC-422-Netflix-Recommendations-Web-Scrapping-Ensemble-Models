This documentery takes you through the lives of John Gacy, Charels Manson who is actually interviewed with his followers and Jeffery Dahmer. It is very facinating on the great lengh of details and how they got the footage and interviews is beyond me. This is just a great film to teach us about our country's darkside. I bought this film because I was doing a project for school and it gave me a fistful of information I did not know about. Plus it also features on the way the FBI profiles the criminal mind which is also very facinating. I encourage anyone who like biographys to see this wonderful piece of work.",
