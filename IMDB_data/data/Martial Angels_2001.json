        "reviewBody": "With such an amazingly wonderfully attractive cast, any six year-old kid could think up some silly plot and still allow for a fairly pleasurable viewing experience. So, the only explanation for MARTIAL ANGELS is that the writer intentionally wanted to create an unwatchable movie. Indeed, this is what we have here -- an unwatchable movie. It is really too bad because the first part of the movie has style, the music is fun, and the actresses are worthy of worship. The writing in MARTIAL ANGELS stinks rotten eggs. \n\n Any Hong Kong movie producers wanting better writing, hey, contact me. MARTIAL ANGLES is proof that you movie producers could do worse than me."
