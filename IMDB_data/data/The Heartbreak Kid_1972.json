        "reviewBody": "I looked for this movie after it was recommended in the documentary Pitch(also worth seeing). The Heartbreak Kid(stupid title) features some excellent acting and courtesy of Neil Simon a brilliant script. It's a pretty funny plot if you like black comedy. A guy 3 days into his honeymoon meets the girl of his dreams. The guy is played by Charles Grodin and the girl is played by Cybil Sheppard who looks absolutely stunning. The main comedy in the movie comes from Grodin's absurd lies or brutal honesty. The first half probably has the best humor but I thought the ending was interesting. Finally I became a big Eddie Albert fan after seeing this movie. He's great as Cybil Sheppard's Dad."
