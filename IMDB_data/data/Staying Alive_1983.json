Far too much time is spent on the actual show though, making you think that the whole movie may as well have been one big recording of a dance show.\n\nMusic is kind of cheesy, specially the music in the Broadway production.\n\nActing is so-so. Cynthia Rhodes gives probably the only convincing performance. John Travolta is his usual one-dimensional self and Finola Hughes is irritating.",
