        "reviewBody": "This little known cable movie was quite a surprise. The script is very well-written, involving flashbacks, tangents and multiple layers that work well to keep the narrative focused. The film features an unknown cast, but the real standout is Kristen Suitors as Bethany Hartfort, playing a believable teen prostitute being harassed by Snake's gang.\n\nThe story begins with a writer investigating a story of a winning lottery ticket, but the trail takes him to a coastal town in Texas. The story often refers to an obscure film from 1969 called \"Seaside Serenade\" and how it more or less has influenced all of the characters in the film.\n\nThe \"bad guys\" do get their comeuppance, and all of the storylines are resolved in a tight 90 minutes. The film ends on a somber note, with the narrator commenting on how obscure Seaside Serenade is (the movie within the movie) and if he would \"fare any better\" as he powers down his computer.\n\nA nice little move from the early 2000s.",
