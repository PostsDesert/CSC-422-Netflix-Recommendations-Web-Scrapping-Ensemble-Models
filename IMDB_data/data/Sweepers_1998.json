        "reviewBody": "Another cheesy B action vehicle from Dolph Lundgren during his prime in the 90s. Sweepers doesn't have a ton going for it, but as a schlocky bad action movie, it's perfect.\n\nThe premise is strange, and it works for an action movie. A minesweeper learns of dangerous new mines being planted, and tries to find the distributor. Dolph goes full Indiana Jones here, wearing the same kind of clothes, even the hat, and he also wears a leather jacket in one scene.\n\nDolph is the best actor here, elevating the proceedings with a certain level of class and charm that the movie really doesn't deserve. Bruce Payne was ok, but this is definitely not one of his best roles. Everyone else was meh.\n\nKeoni Waxman, a director most notable for his B and C-list action films, is responsible for 9 Steven Seagal DTV movies, and 2 Steve Austin ones. It's unfortunate, as he's a good action director, and he stages some nice set pieces.\n\nThe action is obviously the reason to watch. The opening battle scene was cool, if slightly laughable, the house shootout, bar fight, jeep/helicopter chase, house fight/shootout, mineshaft fight and shootout, and final battle aboard the train were all good. The movie's strength is in the last 15 minutes, and the train sequence was cool. The movie looks to have a pretty high budget, with lots of practical effects and tons of explosions. It's thoroughly satisfying.\n\nIt's another excellent piece of B entertainment overall, and it's one of Dolph's more underrated films for sure. I recommend it to action and Dolph fans. It's a bad film, but enjoyably bad.",
