Following a bigger box office return than any of the previous three films, there was obviously no choice but to bring Jason back in Part 5.\n\nThey did everything right here....Revived Jason from part 4, sent him back to Camp Crystal lake and laid in a ready supply of machetes! The end result wasn't actually either great cinema or great horror, but it hit the spot with those that mattered - The Voorhees followers, of which where remain millions worldwide.\n\nOne of the better sequels, but not the greatest."
