        "reviewBody": "Sacret Silence is shoot in an unique way as many of the characters talk directly to the viewer. It almost seems that as if nothing else is happening around them  and it is only you they want to share their troughs with. This method adds a documentary atmosphere to the movie, which I believe will be appreciated by everyone who likes the serious European cinema.\n\nSacret Silence is a movie about society and the way it can be blinded by its own perceptions or by people who want the others to see the world through their eyes and refuse to accept that there are other ways to think about an issue than their own.. That is why the priest is fighting with Camorra (the mafia )  it is just that sometimes in life there is more to loose than to win.\n\nTraditional Italian songs are used for the soundtrack of Sacret Silence; most of them are performed by the 13-year-old Nunzio. I come to appreciate this music as it is evident that he feels the music  just look at his facial expression while he is singing.\n\nThe movie focuses on a whole range of moral issues. The relationship between the priest and Nunzio is only one of them  at first I thought that I can understand the priest  his love for Nunzio, but at the same time his past is flashing through the eyes of the other boy who comes to visit him  and this past seems to be disturbing.Yet another issue is to be able to decide for yourself who is committing the biggest crime in this movie  it is the priest , or the mafia or may be as often happens these days the crime committer is the police itself ?",
