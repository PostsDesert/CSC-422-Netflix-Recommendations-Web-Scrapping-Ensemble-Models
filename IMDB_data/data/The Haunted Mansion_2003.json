When they discover that the place is haunted, Jim discovers an important lesson about the family he's neglected as they attempt to escape.\n\nOther than the \"Shrek\" films, Eddie Murphy's career took a rather downward turn after the 1980s. And although he may or may not have been right for this part (something seems a little off), it is not the terrible flop that people make it out to be.\n\nFans of the ride will be impressed with how they were able to take so many elements and turn them into a single narrative. If you want a faithful adaptation, this is much closer to the source than \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" (even if that is the better film).\n\nThere are a few scenes that might scare younger viewers (much like the ride), but overall this is pretty good family fun. Besides Murphy, we get some decent performances from Wallace Shawn and the wonderful Terence Stamp, who does the Karloff-as-old-butler routine quite nicely.",
