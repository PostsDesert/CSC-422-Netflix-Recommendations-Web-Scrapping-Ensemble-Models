        "reviewBody": "Well, this is one movie that in my opinion really sucked. It could have had all the potential of being great, but instead it turned out to be everything else but. The acting wasn't terrible, but the story was. At least the cutting and the way in which the story proceeded.\n\nA lot of side stories were never followed up, and I can think of a thousand other things that would have been much more relevant to the story that they could have included in this movie. I like, or rather love, a good movie about Vlad, Dracula or vampires, but in this case I was really disappointed. Vlad wasn't even scary.\n\nThis could have been a good movie, but the script totally f**ked it up. The love affair between Justin and that old-english dead babe was totally uncalled for and just felt unnecessary. A lot of things didn't make sense at all and... well, I don't know what I'm saying anymore.\n\nOh yeah, one more thing: how cool is it to have the main villain (and in this case it is goddamn DRACULA) strangling his victims??? Not cool at all. This definitely made Vlad seem weaker than he really should be.\n\nYeah yeah. The movie sucked. So be it.",
