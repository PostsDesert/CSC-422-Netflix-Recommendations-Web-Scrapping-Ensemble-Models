        "reviewBody": "I love Recess, for me it is one of the last \"good\" Disney shows. And generally I liked All Growed Down, it is not as good as the show or School's Out but it is better and closer in spirit to the show than Taking the Fifth Grade. What was it that I didn't like very much? I personally do think that the film could have been 10 minutes longer, it all seemed too brief and short to me. I am also not a fan of TJ's voice, I can kind of forgive Taking the Fifth Grade because he was meant to be older(but only by a year) but not so much here. It lacks spunk and seems too adolescent for a 9-year old schoolboy. But my biggest problem was with Gus, his story is very inconsistent with what we know about him in the show and to me he seemed very out of character as well. However, the animation is bright and colourful, in keeping in style to the show's actually, and the music still manages to be catchy. The writing is smart and funny, not only that but also manages to be true in spirit too, while the story apart from the thing with Gus is cute and charming. All the characters are recognisable and on the most part consistent with the show, Gus in fact I think is the one exception. Apart from TJ, the voices are very good, Principal Prickley, Miss Finster and Spinelli are spot-on. All in all, I found All Growed Down good on the whole, though lacking those extra things to make it great. 7/10 Bethany Cox",
