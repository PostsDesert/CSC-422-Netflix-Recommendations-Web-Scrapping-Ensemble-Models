        "reviewBody": "I loved this film\n\nWhen I was 17 I first saw the second half of this movie on TV, the next day I scoured my local video shops to buy the film so that I could watch the first half.\n\nI know that sounds a little sad but I really felt that at the time this film was spot on. Parents do seem to hate you, it is incredibly hard to talk to a girl that you want to ask out and school is the last place you ever want to be. This film had the emotions just about right.\n\nI now see its faults but I still feel that it is an excellent movie to its targeted age group, everyone who ever wanted to \"rise up in the cafeteria and stab them (teachers) with your plastic fork\".\n\nI could fill this review with quotes, the speech on why teen suicide is a bad idea is up there with the \"Am I funny?\" scene in goodfella's.\n\n Christian Slater is excellent, apparently it's his favourite movie and you can see that he enjoyed making it. He does dark-teen like no one else, this is Nicholson at 16! In my humble opinion this film is at the top of the teen-flick chart alongside Heathers.\n\nSamantha Mathis makes an intriguing leading lady, she really gets her character spot on. Miss Mathis also provides one of the best sexual tension scenes ever in this genre. (it's all in the music)\n\nA young Seth Green also makes an appearance that I am sure he would rather forget, his acting is fine it's how he looks thats the problem !!\n\nThis film is dark, funny and brutaly honest. If you are under 20 and still hate the world this will kill a couple of those boring 'too old to play to young to drink' hours.\n\nHighly recommended.",
