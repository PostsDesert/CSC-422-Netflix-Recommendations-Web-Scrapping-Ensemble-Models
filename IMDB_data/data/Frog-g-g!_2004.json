        "reviewBody": "This was one great cheesy monster flick. Sort of like an updated, lower budgeted, tongue-in-cheek version of Humanoids From The Deep. You have a horny giant mutant frog, you have naked lesbians, you have action, a love story, everything.\n\nOkay, it was real low budget, but the acting wasn't too bad. They probably could have done with a little more money for the frog costume, maybe a few more mutant frogs, but for what they had they did a really good job.\n\nAnd the directing and editing were pretty good. Often with low budget flicks I get distracted by too many static camera long shots and bad pacing, but this film didn't suffer from either of those.\n\nIf you liked Humandoids, if you groove on Troma, then you'll love this little fun movie.",
