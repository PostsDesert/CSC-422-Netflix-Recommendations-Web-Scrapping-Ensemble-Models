        "reviewBody": "I saw \"Milk Money\" when I was eleven; much of what happens in the movie is the sort of stuff that would make any eleven-year-old boy think \"Whoa...cool!\" Looking back on it, I still think that it was pretty funny, but was it the most mature movie? No, and it doesn't pretend to be. I read somewhere that this movie was sexist; I wouldn't know one way or the other. All that I interpreted was that the movie was a nice, horny excuse to have fun. Richard Benjamin has proved himself to be quite capable as a director, and this adds to that.\n\nI know, the prostitute-with-a-heart-of-gold context is a clich√©, but this is a comedy, so it passes. And believe you me, this V (Melanie Griffith) is definitely a V for vendetta! Also starring Ed Harris, Malcolm McDowell, Casey Siemaszko, and a very young Anne Heche. Really entertaining, especially the report on the female reproductive system.",
