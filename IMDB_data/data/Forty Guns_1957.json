This was one of Stanwyck's later pictures when she had a lower price range and she made some of her best pictures in this period. I know not too many people are going to agree with that but so what. Barry Sullivan never made it out of the \"B\" pictures and when he did he was just in a supporting role. Sullivan plays a Wyatt Earp type with his two brothers and he just wants to retire. The old west is dying out and Stanwyck would also like to get out. This movie sort of reminds you of Johnny Guitar with Joan Crawford but it would hard to say which one is better. If you are a fan of Stanwyck's or Fuller's would should see this movie.",
