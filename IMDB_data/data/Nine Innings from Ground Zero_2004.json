        "reviewBody": "For the people saying anything baseball oriented you should just shut you mouth. When it comes to this documentary you people should understand that this was about the affect baseball had on peoples lives that were constantly reminded of those tragic events on 9/11. Just because you people weren't in New York or around it when it happened doesn't mean you should dismiss this and try to undercut the affect it had on people. I lived in Connecticut, about 20 minutes out of the city and even I was affected. Talk to the millions of lives that were affected by this or try explaining to the little girl that lost her father and than the Yankees send her to hang out with the team and talk to Derek Jeter. Did you people just not feel connected or is it jealousy that allows you to appear to be such dumb asses. You people say that this was lame obviously didn't know (and still don't) that you witnessed the best World Series ever. I am a Yankees fan and I am saying that and they lost. You had Jeter's flip play - Jeter backhanding a ball in the stands - Tino's shot to tie with 1 out left- Jeter becoming Mr. November - Scott Brosius doing it again the next night off the same closer- and than the Diamondbacks beating the Yanks. It was magical and it gave people something to believe in. Maybe its just that you don't have memories of sports becoming something bigger than you ever thought it could be. Maybe your teams never gave you anything to believe in and move you to emotions you didn't think you could express as fans. I highly recommend this documentary and for those of you that hate on it I just simply feel bad for.\n\nGary aka Coach K",
