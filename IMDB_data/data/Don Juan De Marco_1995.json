It gives its audience respect by delivering a clever story with good actors and great lines. \n\nThe story is quite absurd and so is the duo in it - Marlon Brando and Johnny Depp. But this is just a good thing. Hollywood usually thinks its audience is filled with morons when making romantic comedies, but this is not so. There are still a few of us out here who enjoy the combination of intelligence, elegance and romance. This film delivers on all counts.\n\nLove is a simple enough ingredient for a film. This film knows how to use it and the result is wonderful.",
