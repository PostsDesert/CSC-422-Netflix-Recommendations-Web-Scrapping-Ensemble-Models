Here, he attacks Children and parents, cigars, angels, theme restaurants, advertising (ironically), religion, god, airport security and germs. With this, he brings a whole new type of stylish comedy that makes Richard Pryor look like Carrot Top. At 61, George comes back with his best, and wins. Best comedy special of the year. A++",
