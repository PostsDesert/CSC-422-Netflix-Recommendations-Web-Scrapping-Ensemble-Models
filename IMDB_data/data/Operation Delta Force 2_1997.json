        "reviewBody": "...IF you can get over the dire acting that's on display, for seemingly no apparent reason the producers have brought in another bunch of actors to play the delta force who are even worse than the original - The action on the ship seems pointless and the bad guys are pretty lousy - they couldn't shoot on target if they tried - they make the good old U.S.A seem better than they were. OK, that's the bad points, The film has a pretty good story concerning a group of nasty Russians (as usual) taking a cruise liner - for reasons if i told you might spoil the movie - so the Delta Squad go into action.\n\nNot bad..The action is virtually non-stop so if You - Like me love loads of gunfights and explosions then you will be reasonably satisfied\n\nI prefer the Original to this, due to a more tense story and it had better acting.\n\nTo date Followed by a further 3 SEQUELS!\n\nMy Rating 6/10"
