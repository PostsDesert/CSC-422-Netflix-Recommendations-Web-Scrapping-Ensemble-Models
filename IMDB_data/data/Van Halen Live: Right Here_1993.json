        "reviewBody": "Definitely the best Van Halen DVD. Video Hits was good (not enough David Lee Roth), Live Without A Net was bearable (sound wasn't great. kind of a softer side of Van Halen). Live Right Here, Right Now is the best. After two albums (OU812 and 5150) Van Halen finally returned to their metal sound. True, it would never be the same with Diamond Dave out of the picture. This has a lot of songs from For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge and some old hits like When It's Love and Jump. It's not the best concert footage I've ever seen or anything, but as far as Van Halen DVDs go it gets a ten. The truth is they haven't put out that much and I'm sure most of us are sitting at home hoping that some old footage featuring David Lee Roth will get thrown on a DVD. No offense Sammy. It's a pity metal's greatest group never put out a concert video with their best singer.",
