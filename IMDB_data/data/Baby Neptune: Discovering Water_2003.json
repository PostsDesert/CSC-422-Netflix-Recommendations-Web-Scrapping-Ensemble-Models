        "reviewBody": "I don't know what it is about water and babies but they can't seem to get enough of it. Well worry no more because this Baby Einstein DVD has enough water to keep even the loudest baby quite.\n\nAll of the Einstein DVDs follow themes and this one is a lovely title. You get to see a selection of real life images with great music. However be warned, for an adult this can get very very boring after a short while. \n\nI have 2 children (3 & 2 years old) and at some point they both have watched it although I think it is better for the younger one. The extras on the DVD were not that brilliant. It can be a bit hit a miss with these titles in regards to what else you get.\n\nHowever if you are looking for another one in the series to add to your collection you won't go too far wrong with this title.",
