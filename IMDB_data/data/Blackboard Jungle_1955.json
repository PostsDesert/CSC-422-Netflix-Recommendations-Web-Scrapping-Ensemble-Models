        "reviewBody": "I think this film is a perfect example of how children and teenagers never really change. Oh sure the music and fashion is dated and looks prehistoric, the kids use lingo from another time and dance to music from another time, but they still act like teens. They think they are the coolest kids of all time and no one will ever be cooler. Then a new batch of teens show up and a new batch and so and so on. And the unthinkable happens to everyone, they get older and then become the middle age farts who don't understand the new generation. When in reality the new generation isn't doing anything too different from any previous generation. I was a teenager in the '90s, guess what? The '90s are over and there are a new generation of teens now who think THEY are the coolest of all time. \n\n Teens are rebellious and act up. They think they are immortal and can never die. They always have, especially since the 1940s and 1950s of America. Even the Bible documents a group of youths making fun of Elisha's baldness 3,000 years ago, \"Go on up you bald head, Go on up you bald head\" Poor kids, God came down with two bears and smote them all for making fun of Elisha. Unfortunately, God won't likely solve every youth problem like that anymore. :) Ways have to be found the way Glen Ford does in this film, to reach out to the troubled youth. And adults must always remind themselves that this is not a \"new problem\" as they so often wish to believe."
