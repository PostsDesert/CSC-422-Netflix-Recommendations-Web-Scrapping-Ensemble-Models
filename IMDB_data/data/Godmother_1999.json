        "reviewBody": "Putting aside Bollywood's somewhat unusual narrative pace and plot structure, this is an excellent movie. Shabana Azmi is simply stunning in her portrayal of Rambhi, a simple farmer's wife who moves to the city with her husband and, when her husband is killed, becomes a veritable mafia Godmother, killing every opponent without so much as a blink and fighting the corrupt political system only to increase her own political power.\n\nAt the same time, it is a movie with a strong feminist twist, as it is the belittled widow who becomes the most ruthless and influential politician in the district; and in the end, when she realizes that she has made some serious mistakes, it is also a very progressive plea for tolerance and understanding -- \"what unites a community also tears it apart\".\n\nThere are a few plot holes here and there and you have to forgive this film a few Bollywood idiosynchrasies, but it's still an easy 9/10.",
