        "reviewBody": "Sunjay Dutt is no great actor, infact he is as wooden as they come. A limited actor, Sunjay is often cast as the heavy or underworld kingpin, his role in Khalnayak was billed as the ultimate villain and he managed to portray the title role brilliantly.\n\nSubash Ghai the self proclaimed 'showman' is no great director, his films are always hyped to death and full of hits and missfires, creating just as much commotion when his films flop as when they are hits. Khalnayak however proved to be a massive hit. I must say Ghai has delivered and how!\n\nThis is Bollywood masala at its best and it also has a message. Sunjay Dutt plays a renowned terrorist on the run, how he and others like him came to be terrorist's against their own country is told throughout the film in flashbacks. In an ironic twist of fate prior to the release of the movie, the films star Sunjay Dutt was arrested and jailed in real life for terrorism related charges this along with the controversy caused by one of the songs in the film made this one of the most anticipated movies ever made in India.\n\nThe film proved to be worth all it's pre release hype and publicity intentional or otherwise with a sensational performance from it's leading lady Madhuri Dixit, an excellent soundtrack and the ever reliable Jackie Shroff this was bound to be hit."
