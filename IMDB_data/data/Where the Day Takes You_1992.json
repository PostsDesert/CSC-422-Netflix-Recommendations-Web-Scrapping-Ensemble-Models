I admit that initially I only wanted to see it because of Balthazar Getty, but it has so many great stars! Everyone does a fabulous job. Great story and characters. I have nothing to base this on, but it seems really realistic. There is some humor and some really sad parts. The director and writer Marc Rocco gives them a lot to work with. I don't see how anyone could not like this movie. Dermot Mulroney, Balthazar Getty, Sean Astin and Lara Flynn Boyle give fantastic performances! I highly recommend this movie! It does make you appreciate what you have and makes you realize how some people, kids, can end up and what can happen to them. Awesome flick!"
