        "reviewBody": "Yeh, this film repeats the done-to-death nonsense of reincarnation, and is sort of a Karan Arjun makeover, but it's not as bad as people perceive it to be (not that anyone remembers or cares for it in the first place). The script is one hell of clich√©, with the same old timeless love stuff, but at the same time it is also a decent watch for lovers of Hindi films. First of all, technically it's quite rare - the camera work is really very good with fantastic cinematography, and the sound design is also not bad at all. The songs are also quite nice and while it's hard to relate to the concept, the film does manage to hold interest and is quite engaging as a thriller. Three of the film's three main leads do well in their parts, with Aditya Pancholi doing the Shahrukh Khan kind of man-obsessed-with-one-girl role. His aging transformation is also done well. Saif Ali Khan was at this point yet to come into his own, but Kajol was more than good as she almost always is. The film's first half is actually stronger than the second, while the second has more tension and suspense. It never really works as a film, and it's far from being memorable, but as a one-time watch, it can be given a try.",
