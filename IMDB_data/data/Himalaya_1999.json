Every shot could be framed and would make a great picture. That alone would be worth while to see it, but the plot is interesting and shows us the life and problems of a different culture. I was captivated from the beginning to the end and realized that even if I would go to Nepal I would never have a chance to get such an insight into the people and experience the land the same way. Go and see it."
