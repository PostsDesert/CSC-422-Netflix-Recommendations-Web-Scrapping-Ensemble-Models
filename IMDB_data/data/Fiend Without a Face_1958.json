        "reviewBody": "A fringe scientist involved with mind over matter experiments unwittingly unleashes a horde of horrible, invisible, brain-sucking\n\nwhatchamacallits in this 1958 thriller that isn't nearly as bad as it sounds. Although Canadian sci-fi films are usually an oxymoron, this one is at least entertaining, even though it makes use of the standard fifties cause celebre: atomic radiation. As a payoff for the audience, we finally get to see the \"fiends\" when the power from the conveniently nearby nuclear reactor is cranked up to reveal them as. . .brains. With brain stems. And antennae. And some surprisingly good stop-motion animation. Marshall Thompson, that staple of fifties B movies, does yeoman duty in this film by not only starring in it, but actually taking over the reins of director when the \"real\" director Arthur Crabtree showed up on Day 1 and refused to direct! It seems that Crabtree angrily told the producers \"I don't do monster movies\" and walked off the set, whereupon Thompson, to his credit, stepped up to the plate. Crabtree came back, a few days later, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nAll in all, \"Fiend without a Face\" may not be in the same league as, say, \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\", but it's not really all that bad, either. Make a big bowl of popcorn, or get some decent pizza, and enjoy."
