        "reviewBody": "I am one of those fussy people who watches selected films. Most films bore me because either they are a re-make (old Indian or American)or the story just does not grab me. I went to see this film after a very long time at the cinema and within the first five minutes, I told me husband what I thought the story would be and I was so shocked to find that the films story was not what I had predicted. I also hate films were the lovers have to die in the end (as they did in \"Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak), because I truly believe that true love can conquer all.\n\nYash Chopra has, as always, delivered an all-round entertainer. The songs were mesmerising; Madan Mohans' tunes were beautiful, Lata Mangeshkars voice was 'an out of this world' experience, Javed Akhtars' lyrics and Aditya Chopras' poem meant so much to those who understand them.\n\nPhotography was enchanting; such films make people like me who love India, love it even more.\n\nThe acting was par excellence, Shahrukh Khan did not disappoint at all, Preity Zinta was the essence of beauty and innocence and Rani was good as well.\n\nI would just like to say thank you to Mr Chopra for a wonderful experience."
