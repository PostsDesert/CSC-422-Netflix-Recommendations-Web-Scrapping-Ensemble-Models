And I really can't blame them, as most of the fabricated film material really looks like almost hundred years old, almost destroyed film.\n\nAnd there are some very convincing famous film people, like Sam Neil, telling their knowledge of this McKenzie.\n\nEven the tone of the film isn't actually very funny, even thought there are some things in it that are so absurd, that they make you laugh.\n\nOver all well made mockumentary.",
