He now has his own cable T.V. show and even if it doesn't last a reasonable season, it will still be entertaining. \n\nHere in this concert, he goes through all his basic routines where he jokes on marriage, sex, common mistakes, common sense and gives his view on things such as Steve Irwin and Viagra, which are some of the best skits out of the entire show. \n\nThis skit doesn't contain excessive foul language and is suitable for the whole family.\n\nRated PG-13 for mild sexual suggestions and brief crude humor ( there isn't anything that the parents will find trouble explaining to teens, it's just a suitable concert for everyone ).",
