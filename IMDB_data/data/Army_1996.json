        "reviewBody": "Overall this was a very good movie. Shah Rukh Khan's scenes were clearly the highlight as his interaction with Sridevi was brilliant and funny. Although I thought he was very good in the film the film focused too much on him (i mean 3 songs with the guy who's only there for 15 minutes?!) It should have concentrated on fleshing out the 'Army' more and the three love stories were basically pointless. I feel Mohnish Behl and Sudesh Berry's characters were more identifiable than the other three and so i was unhappy with the climax. The first song especially and the 'Army' song are clearly the only two songs worth remembering. But watched as a whole the movie leaves you feeling good.",
