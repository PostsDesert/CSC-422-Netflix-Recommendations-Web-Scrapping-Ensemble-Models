        "reviewBody": "This 2004 installment to the Scooby-Doo franchise is a very mediocre and generic movie experience, even for a Scooby-Doo adventure.\n\nYou know what you are getting yourself into here, for better or worse, as all Scooby-Doo animated movies are essentially the same, just presented differently visually. So there is familiarity in what you get here at least, but that is also where it ends.\n\nWhy? Well, because \"Scooby-Doo and the Loch Ness Monster\" doesn't break the formula and give you something beyond what you would expect from an animated Scooby-Doo movie. And that was ultimately why the movie failed to climb out of the gutter of mediocrity.\n\nThe voice acting was good, as it usually is in these animated movies, and you have Frank Welker, Mindy Cohn and Grey Griffin, but Matthew Lillard was missing from the equation and it was audibly clear that he was not there. The movie also boasts the talents of John DiMaggio and Sheena Easton.\n\nAs for the art and animation, well it was good, as it usually always is in these animated movies in the Scooby-Doo universe. Again, playing on familiarity, and hand on heart, then it is great to sit down now into my 40s and look at something that looks exactly the same as when I was a kid. Now, I can just enjoy it with my own son.\n\n\"Scooby-Doo and the Loch Ness Monster\" is not a bad animated movie, not at all. It just suffers terribly from being way too mediocre and generic. But hey, it is a Scooby-Doo adventure nonetheless.",
