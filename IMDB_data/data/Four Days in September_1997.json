        "reviewBody": "This is a truly passionate film about young men and women who fight for ideals that they believe in.\n\n A Brazillian rebel group has kidnapped the American ambassador for Brazil, and demands that fifteen jailed political prisoners be let free. This leads to some tense sequences with Fernando, the most intelligent and cowardly of the kidnappers, and the ambassador (played brilliantly by Alan Arkin).\n\n This could have become a routine thriller. It isn't due to it's intelligence and passion. A very worthwhile movie.\n\n** Even if you're turned off by the idea of subtitles, don't worry. There is a lot of English."
