The clone wants to lead a normal life by taking over his family.\n\nI don't know why so many reviews are down on Baldwin. I thought that he and the whole cast did a good job, including the four child actors.\n\nThe movie's a little slow but still good if you take two nights to watch it. It's much better than Servants of Twilight (from Koontz's novel Twilight) and many other of his movies.\n\nIntensity was really good as was the more recent Odd Thomas.",
