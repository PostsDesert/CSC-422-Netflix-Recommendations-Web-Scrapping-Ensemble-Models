The book was somewhat better, but I thought the movie was very intelligent, disturbing and outrageous. The cast does well, especially Deborah Kara Unger, who gives the best performance in the movie. As usual, Cronenberg creates another world, and either you want to go there or not, but this time it ended up being fascinating, for me at least."
