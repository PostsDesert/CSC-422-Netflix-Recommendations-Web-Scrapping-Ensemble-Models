        "reviewBody": "This has all the wonderful qualities of true fantasy. It is a story that becomes timeless of an artificial creature who is unfinished by his creator. Edward would have been like a human if his maker had not passed away. He ends up with sharp scissors instead of hands. Because he is quite docile and mute, he is taken in by a family and loved. But his strange being causes others to reject and vilify him. Whenever anything happens concerning his hands, it is immediately assumed that he had evil intent. Johnny Depp plays Edward with a true sensitivity that resounds in the film. He becomes a love interest for one character. This part of humanity is beyond his thought processes. Others want to be rid of him although one wonders what sort of threat he offers. Everything eventually comes to a head when the world seems to turn against him and he returns to the place of his \"birth.\" This is an outstanding, original film.",
