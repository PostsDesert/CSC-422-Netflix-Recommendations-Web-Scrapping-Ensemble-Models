In no time at all, the local hillbilly population is under attack by these slime-covered wigglers. Indeed, the tiny cattle from Willie's Worm Farm have become enraged, and the humans had better watch out! These worms bite! They also squeal like rusty hinges!\n\nBEWARE: If you think that worms are icky, then you are in for some major ick!\n\nStupendous characters abound, including the world's least heroic hero, Mick (Dan Scardino), the wretched Sheriff Reston (Peter Maclean), Roger (A.W. Dow), the man that halfwits point at saying, \"Hey! Look at the halfwit!\", and the unforgettable, pot-puffing Alma (Fran Higgins) and her enormous shoes!\n\nSQUIRM is Director Jeff Lieberman's creeping, crawling contribution to the \"when nature attacks\" movie sub-sub-genre. As such, it's a bait bucket full of hilarious fun! Roger's unspeakable transformation, and the dreaded \"worm tidal waves\" are especially rib-tickling!\n\nEXTRA POINTS GO TO: Jean Sullivan as the ethereal, seemingly LSD-powered Naomi \"Ma\" Sanders!\n\nEntertaining, ridiculous, and just plain weird!..."
