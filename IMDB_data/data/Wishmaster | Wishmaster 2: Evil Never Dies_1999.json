        "reviewBody": "I first saw this in the late 90s on cable tv. Revisited it on a dvd which I own. Director Jack Sholder (Alone in the Dark n The Hidden) failed to revive this series. In this film, the demon is once again set free accidentally but the conclusion of the first part made sense while the conclusion of this part is jus a convenient way to end a lousy sequel. The only new twist is that the demon has to collect 1000 souls before granting the three wishes to the awaker n for this he lands himself in a prison where it's an easy way for fellas to ask for wishes. In fact, the demon visits a casino to cash in on the remaining souls. The kills r nothing compared to the first part, except for the lock up scene where an inmate has to pass thru a metal barricade. Ther is a sex n shower scene minus the nudity. The gothic girl suddenly becomes chaste even after sleeping with a priest. Maybe fornication with a priest is ok when u want to be pure n clean.",
