        "reviewBody": "\"The Brak Show \" is good .Probably not in the same level than \"Aqua Teen Hunger \" or \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast \", but definitely it have many brilliant moments .Basically it follows the life of Zorak and Brak that have normal lives and go to the school ,living in a neighborhood on the style of the 50 'sitcoms . The humor and the animation of this show it's very much as \"Aqua Teen Hunger \" (and in one episode you could see Meatwad) with bizarre situations and strange characters .But it is good ,it have funny parts . Some of the songs are great ,others not very much but I like this show . The funniest character is the father of Brak . (that is a human ,nobody knows why )",
