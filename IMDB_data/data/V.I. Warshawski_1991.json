        "reviewBody": "\"V.I. Warshawski\" (Kathleen Turner) is a private detective who is hired by a former hockey player named \"Bernard 'Boom Boom' Grafalk\" (Stephen Meadows) to investigate some deals involving his two brothers. When her client is murdered she not only inherits the murder case but temporarily gets Bernard's 13 year-old daughter \"Kat\" (Angela Goethals) as well. Throw in a shady mob figure by the name of \"Smeissen\" (Wayne Knight), a fatherly cop \"Lt. Mallory\" (Charles Durning) and a two-timing newspaper journalist named \"Murray\" (Jay O. Sanders) and what develops is a good action movie with plenty of humor along the way. Now, while this movie certainly has some faults what I liked best about it was the performance of Kathleen Turner who I thought did quite well in spite of some weak dialogue and a couple of rather obvious and predictable scenes. She also had some great legs. In any case, I enjoyed the movie and I rate it as slightly above average.",
