        "reviewBody": "This movie starts off with great promise, especially for those with an interest in the performing arts. It is ambitious in scope, tying together three generations of several families centered around the devastating and tragic events of WWII. However, it proves overly ambitious, as the various stories end up trite and superficial, and didn't stand the test of time. I liked this movie when I first saw it in the theaters, and especially appreciated the great dancer Jorge Donn performing Maurice Bejart's Bolero in its entirety. I would say that is still the highlight of this movie (being a former dancer) but I have to say the other dance scenes reminded me of the bad 80's leg-warmer infested choreography of John Travolta's \"Stayin' Alive\". And what's up with the down and out Edith character who's washing windows at a dance studio one day, and ends up being a professional dancer the next, albeit not a very good one. Couldn't Jorge Donn tell the writers that a dancer needs more training than watching other dancers while washing windows??!! Also, the ending made you feel like you just watched an expensive commercial for Red Cross and UNICEF.",
