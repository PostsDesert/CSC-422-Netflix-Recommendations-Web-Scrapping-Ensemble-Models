        "reviewBody": "My sister knows of my love of vampire movies and novels. She asked me to watch \"The Sisterhood\". Come to find out later, she did it as a joke. I knew I had just lost over an hour of my life for nothing. I've never seen a more mind numbing movie in my life. What were they thinking? The actors were completely atrocious. They sounded more like they were reading cue cards(and badly) than talking from memory. Most of the movie was girl-on-girl action and touching themselves when no one else was around. Tasteless. Cheap, extremely cheap, special effects. Lame script. No plot(was it even really about vampires?) Crappy location. Were these people hired because they agreed to take their clothes off? I can't help but recall a quote when I watched this. \"It just goes to show you, you don't have to have brains to make it in showbiz\". And this film proved that theory. If I could have given this movie lower than a 0, I would've. I can't even tell you exactly what it was about. By watching this, I could physically feel my IQ points drop. Fortunately, I picked up a classic novel and begin to reload my brain back to full capacity. So, if you value your intelligence, don't even touch the case that the movie comes in. If you do watch it and feel yourself becoming dumber, don't say I didn't warn you. Pick up a Shakespeare novel or watch \"The Gummi Bears\". At least you'll learn something.",
