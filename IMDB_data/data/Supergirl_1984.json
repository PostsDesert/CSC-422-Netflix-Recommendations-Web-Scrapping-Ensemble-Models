        "reviewBody": "I guess I was 7 or 8 when my parents took me to the cinema for the first time. They picked Supergirl as something fun and unthreatening. I have been hooked on film ever since! Supergirl is a hugely under-rated movie, and while I can take on board some of the negative comments you read here, I also think they're a bit harsh. Come on people (you know who you are), it's a fantasy film! If it played the same as Superman (another great), there would be no point in making it in the first place. Sure the magic angle is slightly odd, but what the hell, it's a fun film which doesn't take itself too seriously, but doesn't go in for over the top slapstick either (take heed Richard Lester!!). And of course the effects are a little dated, it is 20 years old after all (though many still look great). Jerry Goldsmith's score it beautiful and lyrical, as it should be, becoming triumphantly heroic when it needs to (The main theme is tremendous, even with the eighties electronic whooshes and eagle squarks). Helen Slater is gorgeous in the lead role, and considering this was her first major role, she does a commendable job. Then there's Miss Dunaway: first rate as always-you can almost see the scenery going down her throat, but that's part of the charm of the character. All the actors come off well, and if you ignore some bits and pieces (there's still some huge plot holes even in the Directors Cut!) you should have a great time. It would be interesting to see a remake that perhaps didn't stray so far from the source mythology (was the omegahedron in the comics?), but on the other hand, the eighties was a different time, and perhaps today's climate (whether the world could use a super-hero or not) is not right to relaunch the poor girl to Earth. One of my all time favourites, and I'm glad to see so many other fans on the IMDB. Let's lobby Anchor Bay for an official Region 2 version. My TV can't broadcast NTSC signals, so have to watch it in black & white, or in jerky (but colour) vision on a slow laptop. Peace. Out."
