        "reviewBody": "Priest Father Michael (Tom Berenger) has a father who's the head of one of the families in the Mafia. Michael protects Angela (Daphne Zuniga) who his father wants dead...and starts to fall in love with her despite being a priest. Now he's torn between love for his family, love for Angela or love for the church.\n\nThe story has been done before and there's plenty wrong with it. For starters Berenger is totally miscast as the priest. In the right roles Berenger can be good--but not here. He's also far too muscular for any priest I've ever seen. Zuniga (with an atrocious faked accent) is no more than OK. The story also has more plot holes than I cared to count. Still it does (somewhat) work.\n\nWithin the first 5 minutes you have female nudity AND full frontal male nudity (unusual in any Hollywood movie). Zuniga has about two nude scenes and Berenger shows off his muscular chest. It is well directed and has a nice music score. There's also a wonderful supporting performance by Anne Twomey as Michael's sister Zena. Also there's a GREAT ending. These do make the movie worth sitting through. Also this DID play in theatres despite what Leonard Maltin says in his video guide. I saw it in a tiny little theatre back in 1988 (it played a week and that was it). I distinctly remember the quiet audience actually laughing and applauded when the main villain got what was coming to them. This is no classic--heck it's not even a good movie--but it's not an utter disaster either. An OK time waster.",
