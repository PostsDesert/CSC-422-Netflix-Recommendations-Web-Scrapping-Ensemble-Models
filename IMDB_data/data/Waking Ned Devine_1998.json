This is more than just a feel good movie, it is a feast of emotions, dreams and the joy of life. The late Ian Bannon is outstanding as Jackie O'Shea, the leader of a fantasy which he manages to hopefully turn into reality. His friend Ned is in fact the bearer of very positive remarks about a chicken dinner that Jackie has cooked and delivered, and in his praise, Ned takes Jackie into the light. With the help of his lifelong best friend, Michael O'Sullivan, played wonderfully by David Kelly, the adventure from fantasy and a strong desire for hope become a classic story worth adding to anyone's movie collection."
