        "reviewBody": "Martin Scorsese has compiled a fascinating personal documentary in \"Mio viaggio in Italia.\" What makes this so compelling is the compassion with which Scorsese renders his selections. \n\nHe admits to having discovered these films, from his childhood to adulthood, not through reading about them (as in a film textbook) but actually experiencing them in the theater. His passion for these works and their directors exudes with great enthusiasm, which becomes infectious.\n\n The films are not superficially presented, but rather in substantial enough portions as to allow one to glean their essence--at the same time, without ruining seeing the entire work. \n\nHis interpretive commentaries reveal one who has been deeply affected by these productions, and who has given great thought to their meaning and significance. \n\nFor the film buff, this is a most engrossing journey; for the young person new to Italian cinema, this is a valuable introduction to an artistic treasure chest."
