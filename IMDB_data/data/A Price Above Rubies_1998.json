This role was devoid of being \"cutesy\" at all. She was gutsy, believable and did a very good Brooklyn accent. I had never heard of this movie for one reason or another, and I'm glad I caught it on cable. A very, very good movie. One other comment: I am a Protestant, and I know very little about the Jewish faith. This movie peaked my curiosity for more knowledge about Hasidic followers of Judaism. I Googled and read about the beginning of the Hasidic beliefs. Once again, the cinema has enlightened me about a subject I previously had no knowledge of.",
