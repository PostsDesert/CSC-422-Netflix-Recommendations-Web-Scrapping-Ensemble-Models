        "reviewBody": "The Trial of the Incredible Hulk was the second in a trilogy of made-for-television films continuing the agonizing journey of scientist David Banner and his quest to cure him of the inner monster called the Hulk. The Trial of the Incredible Hulk stands as the best of the bunch, and remains a fairly well-written and superbly acted telepic.\n\nBanner is arrested and charged for a crime he doesn't commit while travelling through a city. His court-appointed attorney is the blind Matt Murdock, who strives to free Banner, who feels he must be locked up. Murdock is also fighting against the corruption of Wilson Fisk, the city's resident crime lord, in the guise of the oddly black-suited Daredevil. We find that like Banner, Murdock had an accident with radioactive materials, but while taking his sight, the atomic trauma left Matt with enhanced senses of smell, hearing, taste, touch, and radar-like sensory perception.\n\nThe late, great Bill Bixby is in top form as the strained David Banner, and his brutish counterpart, the Hulk, is again portrayed intensely by the legendary Lou Ferrigno. Rex Smith, veteran of a variety of television shows and soap operas, is excellent as Matt Murdock, and his athletic alter ego, Daredevil. Smith delivers most of the best lines in this film, and might have been a good lead in a spin-off Daredevil series. Character actor John Rhys-Davies is Wilson Fisk, the cool and calculated crime boss, known by the moniker, the Kingpin, in the comics.\n\nThe film's effects and action sequences are standard television fare -- done quickly and cheaply -- but still, it is a very promising and uplifting film, right down to its exciting climax and positive ending.\n\nRecommended."
