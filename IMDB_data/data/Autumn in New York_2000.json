It's actually what you could call a typical Gere movie! But Charlotte is sick and we don't know if she'll live much longer. \n\nAbout the acting. Richard Gere is Richard Gere in this movie. I don't know about other reviewers, but it seems to me that he always delivers the same kind of performance. Beautiful Winona is good but not excellent in this one. After seeing her superb performance in «Girl, Interrupted», I was a little bit disappointed.\n\n6 out of 10.",
