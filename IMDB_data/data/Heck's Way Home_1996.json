The storyline of all the impossible unfolding events are drawing in how they transpire to move you and left me in awe at the end of the movie. I never wanted it to end. I felt as though I were there a witness. If I'm not mistaken if a gimmick or not but I believe we're told this is true story somewhere in the movie which either way, incredible. That is all.",
