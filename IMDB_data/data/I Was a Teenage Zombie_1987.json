        "reviewBody": "My review was written in June 1987 after watching the movie in 16mm at a Times Square screening room.\n\nThe best thing about \"I Was a Teenage Zombie\", unfortunately, is its title, harking back to the Heman Cohen hits of the 1950s that launched the acting careers of Michael Landon and Gary Conway. New pic is a low-budgeter that is amateurish in every department and a very long shot to curry favor in midnight bookings.\n\nThin plot has a drug pusher named Mussolini (hambone Steve McCoy) selling toxic maijuana to high school students, causing one of them (George Seminara) to go through special makeup convolutions that are a hint of the poorly executed, grossout makeup effects to come. Mussolini ends up dead and dumped in the river, but comes back to life (face painted green) as a zombie caused by a leak into the river from a nearby nuclear power plant.\n\nWhen the hero (Michael Ruben) is killed, his pals dump him into the river to create a good guy zombie to do battle with Mussolini. Pic climaxes with extreme gore at the high school dance.\n\nBesides the phony, done better many times before makeup effects., pic suffers from idiotic dialog, amateur acting and direction worthy of a home movie. A nonstop score of rock songs functions as droning muzak in the background."
