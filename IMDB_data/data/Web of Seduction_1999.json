Traci Smith is the prettiest of the other two female actors in the film a unhappy wife not getting much attention from her husband that's always hanging out with his clients. She's not very happy of the way things are going so she turns to her neighbor that's going through the same ordeal.At first she seem all right with the idea but she realizes this has certainly gone too far. Near the end she couldn't take much of this anymore and decides she might as well come clean with this before it really starts to drive her up the wall so she calls 911 and that's where you can tell it in her eyes that she was about to admit something."
