        "reviewBody": "This movie can only be understood or appreciated for those familiar with James Joyce's work. The movie is extremely similar to Joyce's lyrical structure. The chapters of his books usually begin abruptly without any explanation. This might explain why the movie seems choppy. The director was obviously trying to mirror Joyce's style. I did not like the movie at first, but after i had read one of his books, I came to understand the movie. However, for cinematic purposes and for the well-being of audiences, the director should have at least explained how Nora affected James more convincingly. I had to look up in the internet on their conflict.\n\nOverall, the movie was good. They could have deleted some the overwhelmingly repetitious scenes (if you have watched it, you will know what i mean). In turn, they should have replaced it with more scenes that discussed the conflicts."
