The original is a heartbreaking movie to watch. \"Part 2\" has its fair share of serious moments but the first movie has a lot more. \"Part 2\" ends up being more fun. The cast is very good with an excellent Bo Svenson leading the way. The movie opens up with a notarized statement swearing that \"Part 2\" is true. That's good enough for me. Long Live Sheriff Bufford Pusser. Honorable mention: one of the greatest moments of nudity in movie history (Angel Tompkins).",
