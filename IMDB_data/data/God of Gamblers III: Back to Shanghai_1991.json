In this movie you can see that he tries to make a parody of a certain movie without disgracing the original. Also he tries to show some good martial arts. God of gamblers III is a lot of fun and has some great action and even some romance. Also it adds a lot of fantasy elements, which gives this parody (of God of Gamblers with Chow Yan Fat) an original twist. You have to get used to Chinese humor and in particular Stephen Chow humor. But if you have seen the original version(s) he makes fun off then you will enjoy this movie! A must see for Stephen Chow fans!",
