        "reviewBody": "This film looks as if it had potential but seems to miss the mark. The story of an American scientist (Paul Newman) who is supposedly defecting to East Germany is engaging and is now dated. Newman's performance is capable. Julie Andrews who plays Newman's wife is mediocre at best - there just isnt much of a character to develop here. As far as a Hitchcock signature on the movie - the death of the policeman, \"Grommek\" is the highlight of the movie. The films turns into a harrowing escape adventure from East Germany. Finally, the things that disappointed me are the vastly cheap rear-projection that was used in making this film. And finally, the decision to scrap Bernard Herrmann's score and replace it was another composer could have made the film more exciting."
