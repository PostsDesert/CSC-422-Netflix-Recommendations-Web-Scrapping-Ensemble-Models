        "reviewBody": "I saw this series at one of the Toronto anime clubs and found it pretty cool. It takes place in the Japan of the 1960s when the economy was booming and the future looked so bright. Unknown to the world's general population Earth has been invaded by aliens who can take human form. To combat this menace is an international secret agency called A.E.G.I.S. (Alien Exterminating Global Intercept System). One of their hidden bases is under Tategami High School. Their special agents have the \"Gate\" power, the ability to open a doorway to another dimension to gain a super ability. One of them is high school girl Ruriko who has the the unfortunate nickname of Rurippe which means runny-nose. The story generally has a monster-of-the-week and we usually see something that was very new in the 1960s like the bullet train in each episode. Ruri is the star of the show but we pick up new team members as the series progresses. The series is good because the writers take the time to explore the background of the various individuals involved. There is even one episode where we learn the sad story about one of the Invaders.\n\nNice character designs. Interesting concept. If you like super-spies and super-gadgets it is definitely worth checking out.",
