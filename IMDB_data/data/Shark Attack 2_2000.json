As direct to video movies go - it ain't that bad - some neat underwater photography and shark attack sequences - The acting is pretty lame but this is not exactly \"Oscar\" material !Some of the actual shark effects are pretty hilarious - they almost look inflatable and at one point the shark looks like a small \"wind up\" toy you would play with in the bath ! Overall - not bad for a night in with your mates and a few beers !!"
