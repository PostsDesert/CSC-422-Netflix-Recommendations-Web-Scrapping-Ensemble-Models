Hillary Duff is a great actor, she is beautiful and fits in with every character she has played. I recommend this film to young girls. But only rent it so you don't waste money on a film you will probably never watch again. I enjoyed this film. I think it has great actors. Not much of a love story... unfortunately... but has a bit of one. I admit i really love romantic films. But this one hasn't got much to it. Great to see what happens in the end, and a great moral to the story. They all live happily ever after... of course!",
