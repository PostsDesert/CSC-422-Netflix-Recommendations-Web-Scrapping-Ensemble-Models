        "reviewBody": "This was a movie I have been curious about for a while before watching it. I had seen previews for it on cable. My guess this was a straight-to-video release, because during 1995, I didn't see any trailers for this movie. In fact, I knew nothing about this movie until I saw trailers for it on cable. Anyway, I'm gonna get straight to the point now. LL Cool J plays this club DJ in this movie, who was a former drug addict, who is forced to work for an undercover cop to get info on a drug pusher. He gets involved with the pusher's girlfriend along the way, because she wants revenge on the pusher because of what he did to her sister. But during the course of the movie, there are some plot twists going along, you never know who was playing who. Some of the most unexpected happens. I thought this movie was good. I can't believe I don't see comments made about this movie. I wouldn't say it's the best low budget movie I've ever seen, but it's rather enjoyable. Watch this movie.",
