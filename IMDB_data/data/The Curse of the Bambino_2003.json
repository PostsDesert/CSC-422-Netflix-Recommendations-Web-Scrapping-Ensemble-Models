As a life-long Yankee fan, it gave me all the incentive I need to look forward to another season where the BoSox don't measure up.\n\n The best part of this film to me, tho, was the segment on the '86 World Series (the Buckner debacle) Watching 4-5 guys repeating Vin Scully's commentary word for word as the ball rolled haplessly thru Buckner's legs almost made me feel sorry for them. Also great was the shot of Carl Yazstremski sinking to his knees as Bucky Dent's ball sailed over the Green Monster.\n\nKeep hoping, Boston!!!",
