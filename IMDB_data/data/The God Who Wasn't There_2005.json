        "reviewBody": "My absolute favorite film of the year. The God Who Wasn't There brings to light some jaw-dropping information on the real origins of Christianity in an engaging and thoroughly entertaining way. A must see for everyone who has suspected that their Sunday school teacher might not have given them the whole story. Also has fascinating and thought-provoking interviews with some of the top scholars investigating the question of the historical Jesus and whether he really ever existed at all. I was particularly struck by the insights on modern Christianity and some of its more troubling aspects. The director, Brian Flemming, takes on all these topics but never loses his humor or warmth. I'm also looking forward to the DVD release, because the special features will be including more commentary tracks and interviews with figures such as world-famous biologist Richard Dawkins and groundbreaking Biblical scholar Earl Doherty. An amazing , excellent film!",
