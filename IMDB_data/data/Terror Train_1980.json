There's a surprising lack of gore, but the killer's multiple disguises are downright eerie. A late in the game twist does genuinely surprise as well. Actors such as Ben Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Hart Bochner elevate the threadbare material throughout and the finale ends up being more intense than it probably should be as the masked madman terrorizes Curtis throughout the train.",
