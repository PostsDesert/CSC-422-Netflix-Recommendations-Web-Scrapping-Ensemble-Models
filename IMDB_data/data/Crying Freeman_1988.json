It embodies love and hate, cruelty and kindness, loyalty and duty, and sacrifice vs self service. Plus it is chock full of gratuitous sex and violence. It also features your normal cast of crazy characters that are as ridiculous as they are essential, playing off the stoic and unbeatable lead. If you're a fan of the old classics (Akira, Ninja Scroll, Vampire Hunter D, Wicked City) you will love this series.",
