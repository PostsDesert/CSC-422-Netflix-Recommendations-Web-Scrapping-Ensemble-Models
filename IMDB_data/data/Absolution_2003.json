The film makes the production for \"The Blair Witch\" project look expert in comparison. Not only is the film quality poor, but the audio is awful. I had to turn the volume up and down. Then you have the cheesy acting, where the kids on Sesame Street do a better job. \n\nI don't mean to step on toes here, as the plot was creative, if not definitely unique. I just couldn't get past feeling like I was watching someone's home videos and endure the whole thing, much less enjoy it. 1/10",
