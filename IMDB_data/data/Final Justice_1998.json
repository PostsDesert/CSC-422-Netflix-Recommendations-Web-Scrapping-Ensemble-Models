        "reviewBody": "The most interesting detail in this matter-of-justice drama, is Annette O'Toole's motivation for kidnapping and humiliating the lawyer who got her brother's murderer acquitted. When questioned about it in court she admits she didn't know. She obviously acted on impulse and did not know what she was doing. But she did it and couldn't do otherwise under the circumstances, being forced by her own female nature to do something, anything, about the intolerable case of having her brother murdered a second time in court by premeditated character assassination. She admits as much as that her main concern and motivation was about their mother.\n\nAnnette O'Toole's performance is outstanding and will go down in cinema. History, like similar performances in some Sidney Lumet films (\"Twelve Angry Men\") and a few more. Her lawyer is also terrific, they make a fantastic pair, and the film is worth watching a number of times, as it is not even without a great portion of humour: Michael McKean in all his humiliation is actually laughable in his grotesque treatment of the law.",
