        "reviewBody": "In ones opinion this is the best of the Gerry Anderson productions. The various plot lines go into many different aspects of the personal lives of the characters, marriage break-ups, blackmail, interracial and sexual tensions (very new on TV in 1970), the loneliness of command and the mundane arguing of budgetry cuts. The acting is as good as anything seen today particularly Ed Bishop, Michael Billington and George Sewell. Excellent direction, marvellous sets and special effects on limited TV budgets. The programme stands the test of time and one thinks that young people of today would find it just as exciting as people did in 1970."
