I located an on-line copy after the usual frustrations of working through links to Youtube that led to short clips, paid subscription copies and so on.\n\nWith several jumps in the plot, I did wonder if the version I saw had been hacked around, but it was the 108 minutes stated here on IMDb. Christopher Jones was unconvincing and uninspiring as Leiser, his fight with Avery a prolonged interpolation and his scrabbling around to get under the wire in the dark protracted. And how lucky he was to come across an attractive girl and child (what happened to him?) in the middle of nowhere - and to bump into her again in a cafe.\n\nThe best things were the wide, open European spaces and Anthony Hopkins' acting",
