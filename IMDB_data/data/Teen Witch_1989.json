The highlight of the movie is the rap-off scene between Kiki and her crush who's \"too funky\" for her to talk to. \"Top That\" had me rolling! The cheesy lighthouse scene was equally as bad, as is the opening scene in Louise's dream on the roof! I even downloaded \"Most Popular Girl\" for memories, when the movie stopped being played on the Disney Channel. The acting is subpar, and so is the plot, but its so unintentionally funny that it rocks! This is a fun movie to watch and make fun of, but not to take seriously, or you'll only be disappointed! A good movie to watch with friends who want to reminisce about the 80s."
