First of all, there were about twenty people in the audience (which was about the average for the entire festival) and second, I don't think I've been that bored in a theater seat before in my entire life. Along with that, I saw lights in shots, sound effects missing, the words not matching the lips, basically a continuing disaster from the get-go. Now, I heard that the director made this in 16 days. Okay, so what? You made a horrible movie. Take your time on the next one, and maybe you won't have people getting up and walking out forty minutes into it."
