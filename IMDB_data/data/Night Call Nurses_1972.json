        "reviewBody": "Classic 70's low budget with very witty writing. Armitage is a genius. Very much ahead of its time in terms of the dialog concerning politics, pharmaceuticals and personal psychology. A cult classic in that sense. The character Barbara is gorgeous and the opening sequence was ripped off and used in Constantine, the latest Keanu Reeves quasi occult film. If you can get past the 70's cheese, there is a very clever and rewarding piece of writing underneath, if you don't think much or cant read between lines you'll concur with the other review. The film moves all over the place and one of the main story lines seams to get resolved in a flash. There is a classic use of voice overs to cut around a lame blonde beauty performance, but it works and is a good lesson in salvage editing for the student. The strength is in the writing of this film, seems there may have been some fluff added by the others involved and if you get the DVD, the original trailers will have you rolling on the floor.",
