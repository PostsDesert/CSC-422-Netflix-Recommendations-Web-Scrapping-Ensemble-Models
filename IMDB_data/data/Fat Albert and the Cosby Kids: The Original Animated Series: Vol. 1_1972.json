Bill Cosby does the voices for himself, his brother Russell, Fat Albert, Dumb Donald, Rudy, and Mushmouth. My dad watched it with me and told me it was a TV series when he was younger. Later, I rented the Fat Albert Halloween Special. I liked that, too. Look for this series on video. I recommend it to all Bill Cosby fans."
