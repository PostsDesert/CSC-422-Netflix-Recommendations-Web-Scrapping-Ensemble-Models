Pete shows that he can do it with, a thick American Accent. Besides that, you really gets convinced by Kiefer 's performance. (in fact, everytime you see him on screen) The only thing that disturbes me, during the movie, is the fact that Sutherland's carachter fades a bit, or maybe the reason why i notice that, is because of his picture was the lead, at the cover of the movie. Anyway...i only payed 10 Danish Croners, which is very cheap, is about 1.5 bucks, so it was cheap for an average movie. I also enjoyed the sound, and direction during the movie, i bought surround-sound a few years back, so it gets the movie a whole new level, when you watch it like that.\n\nKief Up The Good Work!!",
