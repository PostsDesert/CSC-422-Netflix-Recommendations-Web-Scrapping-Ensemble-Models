        "reviewBody": "This is the fifth Dragon Ball Z movie to be released during the series' Japanese TV run. When Cooler finds out that his brother Frieza was defeated by a Saiyan, he and his three henchmen go to Earth to seek revenge and destroy the planet as Piccolo, Gohan, and Krillin attempt to help an injured Goku get his strength back and defend the Earth. This movie was an improvement over the lasr DBZ movie as the plot centered around a villain closely related to a major villain in the DBZ TV series. This DBZ movie attempts to try some new things, such as putting more of a focus on Piccolo, Krillin, and Gohan in the battles and spicing the battle sequences with samurai-film-like elements. As DBZ fans will enjoy the battles and the villain, this DBZ movie's plot suffers from being a bit shallow as it only focuses on the villain's plan to destroy Earth. Also, DBZ fans may be a bit disappointed by the movie's short running time of 47 minutes.\n\nGRADE: 2.5 out of 5"
