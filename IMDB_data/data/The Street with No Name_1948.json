        "name": "Richard Widmark & Mark Sevens in a Suspenseful Semi-Documentary",
        "reviewBody": "\"The Street with No Name\" is an effective and very suspenseful noir with semi-documentary techniques that are reminiscent of those by Henry Hathaway. Directed by William Keighley, an able action director (\"G-Men\", \"Each Dawn I Die\"), it stars Richard Widmark as the creepily murderous mob boss Stiles and Mark Stevens as the innocent looking FBI agent in peril. The film often feels like a painfully dated propaganda for the FBI and its ingenious ways of infiltrating a crime ring after a murder of two innocent people. But the realistic location shooting and the presence of Widmark & Stevens make it watchable."
