        "reviewBody": "Sometime in 1997,I recall listening to an edition of \"Fresh Air with Terry Gross\" where they did a tribute to the late NBC executive Brandon TArtikoff(who is generally credited with fostering NBC's resurgence in the ratings through most of the 1980s),who had passed away shortly before. They played an interview bit where Mr.TArikoff was asked about \"Highway to Heaven\" and his reaction to being pitched this series by NBC standby and TV icon Michael Landon. He told Landon something to the effect that he wasn't really sure how well a show like this could be successful in a period dominated by Stephen Cannell/Glen LArson/Aaron Spelling shows,saying something to the effect of \"This show could be broadcast in black and white and there would be no real change to it\". To which Landon replied something to the tune of \"Look,there aren't really ANY shows like it on television now,and what will it hurt to give this one a try?\". Tartikoff was convinced,ran the show and it preceded to have an effective,five season run before quiet cancellation.\n\nI was fairly skeptical of these shows as a kid and didn't really warm up to them until I was in college(!). I suppose I felt like it was probably a little too heavy-handed in its moralizing and,to be quite frank,anything that DIDN'T promise sex and/or violence when I was in junior high really didn't seem to interest me. It wasn't until I was a little older(And maybe a little bored),watching rerun t.v. at my college dorm that I stumbled across the show and gave it a chance. I must say that,as schmaltzy as it was(And that heavy music track didn't ease the tension!),it was at heart a sweet,heartfelt show that taught simple lessons about morality and faith. \n\nCrafted almost like an anthology series(I hope I'm using the right term here),the cast was merely LAndon as human-turned-Angel Jonathan Smith,traveling with retired-cop and faux grouch Mark Gordon(Victor French),going from city to city,town to town,on missions determined by the almighty,in order to help Smith get to heaven for good(turns out,he's a probationary angel it seems). EAch episode feature different principal players who interact with JOnathan and Mark,and the lessons they learn.\n\nI would have to say I recommend this one. Whether it's TVLand or DVD(if it's there already,and I kinda think it is)where you see this,you should get the same effect,and a good one at that."
