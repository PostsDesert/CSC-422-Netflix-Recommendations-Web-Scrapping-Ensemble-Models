The animation is good, but the story is a bit hard to understand,either by the lack of production of it or the english dub. Also the movie does a lot of fan service, showing an unnecessary and gratuitous amount of breasts, still its not as much as other anime films. Gowcaiser is an amusing movie, but it can be compared to others like Akira and Galaxy Express 999.",
