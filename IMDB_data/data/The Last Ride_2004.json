        "reviewBody": "Dennis Hopper makes this movie worth the viewing, and the pretty cars and Nadine Velazquez certainly help as well. The similarity with Carmack's character and any number of recent \"speed\" films is obvious. He drives a modified Mitsubishi and thinks he's all that. But Hopper's character (1969 Pontiac GTO Judge) throws a wrench into that formula, and is one we haven't really seen in this kind of modern car flick. Hopper brings the legitimacy of a little known 1970's \"Bonnie and Clyde\" type art house flick mixing it up with the new & flashy \"tuner\" style.\n\nKinda like Two Lane Blacktop meets 2 Fast 2 Furious.",
