        "reviewBody": "Having just turned 42 and suffering from a midlife crisis, a musical composer by the name of \"George Webber\" (Dudley Moore) leaves his colleague's house and on the way home happens to see a beautiful bride in the back seat of a limousine being driven to a church for her wedding. Although he is currently in a committed relationship to a musician by the name of \"Samantha Taylor\" (Julie Andrews) he becomes determined to find out as much about this gorgeous woman as possible. What he doesn't take into account, however, is the difficulties this new obsession of his will bring upon everybody associated with him along the way. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that when this picture initially came out most people were intrigued by the sensational film debut of Bo Derek (as the bride \"Jennifer Hanley\") who became an international sex symbol overnight. However, there is much more to this movie than that as both Dudley Moore and Julie Andrews were nominated for Golden Globe Awards for their performances while Henry Mancini was likewise nominated for an Academy Award for his musical score. I especially liked the piano solo in the Mexican bar and the song by Julie Andrews at the very end which were both quite beautiful. In any case, while the film might not rate a perfect \"10\" it certainly had its moments and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",
