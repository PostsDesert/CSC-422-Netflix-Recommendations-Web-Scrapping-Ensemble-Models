Seriously...I did not know one single woman in the theater that day! We all loved the movie right off...\n\nMy sister bought it and we watched it with captioning, and boy had we missed a lot of lines at the theater and funny ones at that! You see with the English accents and all their slang-- you just can't understand a lot of what they are saying...\n\nWatch this movie with and without the captioning! It's like watching a movie with English being your second language, and I B.S. you not!\n\nThe English working class has a different way of expressing themselves--its so charming and hilarious...\n\nI think Robert Carlysle is brilliant \"Gaz\". I cannot think of anyone who could have done it better. \n\nThis movie cannot be beat! I bought it and recommend it to everyone!! Definitely a ten out of ten."
