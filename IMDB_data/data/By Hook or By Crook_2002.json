She is gay and commented on the fact that there really weren't any films that dealt with gay females on a platonic level. This movie was heartwarming, cute, and funny. I love the part about \"can you make us look like carpenters?\" It shows the fabulous wit that went into the movies making. These women (who made the movie) set a powerful scene in motion. The people in it are so real, and the feelings are heartfelt. See this movie"
