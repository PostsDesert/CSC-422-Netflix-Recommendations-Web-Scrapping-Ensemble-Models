        "reviewBody": "\"Maverick\" is based on the popular television series of the same name. The film is pretty faithful to the series as Mel Gibson stars as the big-time gambler. James Garner (the original Maverick) has a great part as a lawman who is tracking Gibson. Jodie Foster is superb as usual. The supporting cast includes Graham Greene, James Coburn, and a short cameo by Danny Glover. The direction and screenplay are both inspired and very impressive.\n\nNot perfect, but very close. 4.5 out of 5 stars."
