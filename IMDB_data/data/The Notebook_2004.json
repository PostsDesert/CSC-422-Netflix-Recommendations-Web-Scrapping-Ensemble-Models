        "reviewBody": "I went into this movie with the misconception of thinking this was just another typical romantic movie, but I was very impressed by this film and the themes portrayed in this movie were handled in a great way.\n\nThis movie will have you feeling happy and joyful and the scenery is just brilliant. You will feel like you are part of the characters, and you will care about them throughout the whole movie.\n\nThe movie gallops in speed as we are absorbed into the great plot and brilliant acting of all the cast involved. Ryan Gosling is brilliant as the shy and quiet Noah, and Rachael McAdams is superbly beautiful as the star of the movie, Allie.\n\nAs I said earlier in my review, I did go into the movie not expecting much and that was because I thought it was a typical \"boy loves girl\" movie which are sometimes just too predictable. Don't get me wrong, they are some good Romantic movies that pull it off very well, but there are simply too many in that particular genre.\n\nThe best thing about this movie was the depth of the plot and the actors playing their characters so well. The supporting cast were good, and James Marsden deserves a mention for managing to pull of a hard role as the \"rich man\" well. Another plus point about this movie was the great script, and you did not see too many \"cliches\" which is always a good sign in a Romance movie.\n\nIt does not matter whether you love romantic movies or hate them, this is NOT just a romantic movie it is so more than that. By the end of the movie you will feel a whole heap of emotions. You will be talking about this movie for a long time.\n\nThe only bad part about this movie is the length, which I think could be shortened a bit but on the whole this was a superb movie which is well worth a watch.\n\nGo and Watch this! Amazing movie which will have you brimming with joy.\n\n9 1/2 out of 10",
