The acting, lead by Peter Cushing, can't be any better; Simon Ward, Maxine Audley, and Freddie Jones deserve special comment in this regard. (There is little point in praising Cushing as Frankenstein; he plays it with such depth and understanding that the role is his and always will be! I can't use any superlatives here that haven't already been used for Cushing's Baron.) And for once, a Frankenstein movie really gets to the key point Mary Shelley is making - by leaving the monster out entirely! Terence Fisher's direction doesn't miss a cue; with the conventionalization of the monster gone, Fisher can take the movie in new, unexpected directions, and does so with the steady hand of a master director. An unqualified success for all involved!",
