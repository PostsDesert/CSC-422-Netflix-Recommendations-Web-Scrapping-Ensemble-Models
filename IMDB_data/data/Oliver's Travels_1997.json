(A equally skilled director helps as well.) Imagine two young American actors in these roles, and you will see what I mean.\n\nThis series - which appeared in the US as a PBS Mystery presentation - which in other hands could have been a mess, is one of the most enjoyable things I've seen on television in a long time. I hope it will be shown again.",
