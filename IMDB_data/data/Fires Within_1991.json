It was originally titled Little Havana, but Robert Redford was going to release Havana, so Alan Ladd (Jr.) had our title changed-at first, to Distant Shores, which was its name all through the rest of production. It was much later I learned it was changed again to Fires Within. I've never seen the film all the way through, but I think I'll check it out now after reading these comments. FWIW, I had the time of my life on this show. Never had so much fun on any other job before or after. Everyone was wonderful, even AD Mark Edgerton, who yelled at me more than anyone ever had, and gave me a beautiful Hoffritz Swiss Army knife at the end of my time on the show. Wonderful memories for me, sorry everyone seems disappointed in the film. It goes to show you, a bad film is every bit as much work and effort as a good one.",
