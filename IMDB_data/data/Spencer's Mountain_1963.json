        "reviewBody": "When I joined the IMDB community, I was asked about my favorite movie. I was at a loss for about five minutes, trying to think of movies that I could truly consider my favorite. This movie finally won over the others I considered when I realized that a favorite is something personal and beyond reproach - you may hate this movie, but I saw at the perfect time of my life and now it means much more to me than it probably could otherwise.\n\nHenry Fonda turns in an excellent performance, which is testimony to his work ethic - he vocally denounced the script as \"corny\" enough to throw back Hollywood film-making 20 years. The children are troopers of the same era as other classic family movies, ala Disney's \"Swiss Family Robinson.\" I imagine the casting companies used were the same.\n\nThis movie accomplishes what it sets out to do - make you care about the Spencer family, their desire for respect and honor, and the sacrifices they make to do what they think is right. There are many moments in this movie where you could be moved to tears.\n\nAn emotional movie with, dare I say it, a lot of heart. It is my favorite movie.",
