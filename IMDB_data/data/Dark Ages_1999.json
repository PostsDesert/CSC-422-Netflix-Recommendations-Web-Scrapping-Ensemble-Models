        "reviewBody": "Given that Rob Grant wrote \"Red Dwarf\" one of the best comedies ever from the BBC that went into series after series \"Dark Ages\" is a pretty poor offering.\n\nSent in 999AD around a motley crew of Saxons it is all largely unfunny - the elements are OK, but a terrible script with unfunny characters drive this into the ground.\n\nThere are only so many jokes about 1999 and current events that can be translated to the Dark Ages. It is hard to say why this fails - partly because Phil Jupiter and Alastair McGowan are both just not good enough actors to carry this? It is all overacted, constantly. I came across this on DVD and gave it a shot - have to be honest and say it is not great. At all. In the least. Nada."
