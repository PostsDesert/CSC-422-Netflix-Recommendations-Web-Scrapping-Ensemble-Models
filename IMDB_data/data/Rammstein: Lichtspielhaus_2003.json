        "reviewBody": "Utterly essential for any Rammstein fan.This DVD comes packed with over 3 hours worth of Rammstein footage,including every video from \"Du riecht so Gut\" to \"Feuer Frei!\" .\"Making of\" documentaries on the videos,interview footage ,over an hours worth of live performances which are highlights from seven major concerts spanning Rammstein's career,TV trailers,advertisements (including hilarious American TV ads).All this comes in a beautifully presented jewel case.The DVD menu screen is a joy to navigate.The band members put themselves across very intelligently and are very well spoken.Rammstein are a band who know what their are doing,their critics would do well to watch this DVD,and see how they feel afterwards.The only downside with this release is that it ends!!! (eventually!!)",
