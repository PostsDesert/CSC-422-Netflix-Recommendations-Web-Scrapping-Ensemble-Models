        "reviewBody": "Not quite near the quality of other Jerry Wald productions, but The Long Hot Summer does have its moments.\n\nThe story comes to life thanks to the real chemistry of Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, who blend passion and artistic talents. But they are terribly overshadowed by a costar who can't stop chewing the scenery.\n\nYes, the whole sumptuous affair tends to get bogged down by Orson Welles' kitschy performance as Will Varner, the southern patriarch who presides over the town and its inhabitants. Welles seems to be punching his scenes up so much that a few of the younger performers, like Tony Franciosa and Richard Anderson, seem to have a hard time keeping their composure. Welles is able to get away with the camp he exudes in a sinister film noir like The Stranger or Touch of Evil, but here it seems somewhat miscast and out of place.\n\nOn a TCM 'Essentials' broadcast, Alec Baldwin slammed Welles' hammy acting. Baldwin made the comment that on the call sheets Welles was listed fourth or fifth, and clearly desperate to be regarded as the star, he pulled out all the stops in a supporting role. It's a dreadful characterization, matched only by the dreadful hair, make-up and endless Porky Pig sweat running down his face.\n\nI need a cool drink of water every time I watch Welles in this film. On second thought, make that a nice tall glass of lemonade on the veranda, honey chile."
