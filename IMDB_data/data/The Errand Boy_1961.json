        "reviewBody": "Jerry Lewis directs, co-writes and stars in The Errand Boy. Film finds the hapless Lewis hired as an errand boy behind the scenes at Paramutual Pictures. There's a method in the madness, had honcho Tom Paramutual (Brian Donlevy sadly under used) wants him to spy behind the scenes to see why the studio is loosing so much money. Chaos inevitably follows.\n\nForget the plot, there actually isn't one to hang your hat on, film consists mostly of Lewis skits strung together as he takes us around the workings of the back lot of Paramount. There's a caustic edge to the piece, with Lewis and co-writer Bill Richmond gleefully saying that where film making is concerned, all that glitters is not gold. Some of the visual gags work, others not so, with a couple running far too long to actually work. But as always with Lewis, his best moments detract from the bad to leave the film entertaining for his fans, even if it struggles to stretch the premise over 90 minutes. 6/10",
