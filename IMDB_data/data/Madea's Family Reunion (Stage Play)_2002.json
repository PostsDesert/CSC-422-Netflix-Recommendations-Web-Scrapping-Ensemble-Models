We would have people who receive the love of God and understand what life is all about. There would be less gangs and more healthy relationships.\n\nNot only were the actors in this play brilliant, the singers blew me away and the music was exciting and moving\n\nThank you Mr. Perry for inviting God, Jesus and the Holy Ghost to participate in your play and share love, hope and understanding with the world. God Bless you",
