Her mother brought her to the United States when she was 5. Sparks fly as she and Elvis get together at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas for Come On, Everybody. Elvis is on the stage. Ann is dancing below. She wears a pink top and black tights. She shakes her boobs and hips. Elvis pulls her up on stage. This is sexy. Too bad they only made one movie together. There is a wedding at the end, so they would have been a married couple in the sequel. ZZ Top revived the title track with a growl.",
