        "reviewBody": "This series was underrated and under appreciated in it's time. It's was getting into a good stride toward the end but unfortunately wasn't renewed for the full 7 seasons many other shows in the franchise got.\n\nI found the show to be a compelling prequel to the original Star Trek. It was interesting to see humans as the newcomer to deep space; they were more than often met with aliens with far superior technology, a lot of them not so friendly. They had to be resourceful to achieve their goals and defeat stronger enemies. It was a refreshing change from the previous shows where the Federation was virtually the dominant faction with the most advanced technology and huge fleet.\n\nEnterprise was about humans being the underdogs and still besting their foes. It was fun to watch!",
