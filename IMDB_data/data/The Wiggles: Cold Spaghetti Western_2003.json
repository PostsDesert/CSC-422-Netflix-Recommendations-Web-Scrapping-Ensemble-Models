        "reviewBody": "My son absolutely loves this video. It's a bit different from the other Wiggles video's out there. The whole video is set as if it were in Texas or New Mexico with everything being cowboy related. All the usual characters are in the movie, with Dorothy, Henry, Waggs, Captain Feathersword.. there's even some new friends in this one. \n\nThe songs are fun, but a few are a little repetitive. One of them is in another language and is a little long compared to the other shorter songs.\n\nIf your child is a Wiggles fan, they will surely get a kick out of seeing them in a totally different style. It's lots of fun and nice to see the guys doing something a little different.",
