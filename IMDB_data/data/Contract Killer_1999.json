The beginning of the movie sets the mood for the rest of the movie: confusing. That's basically the only word I can use to describe it. I'm not going to write any spoilers, so I'll keep it simple. This action/conspiracy (or whatever you want to call it) movie is a combination of scenes having little to do with each other. Justin Rhodes adds some implausible romance to the movie to make it more enjoyable, but fails miserably. Maybe it'd be more pragmatic if it was between lovers, but I was thrown off by the lunacy of a captor-captive relationship. This, coupled with other blatant impossibilities, produced a movie that was unbearable. I really hope you choose something else for your one and a half hour movie time slot. Try Stand By Me, although it's in a different genre.",
