        "reviewBody": "The 2001 remake of Lewis Milestone's \"Ocean's Eleven\" is a good adventure, with action, comedy and thriller in an updated screenplay. When this sequel was released, I was impressed with the number of stars and locations mostly in Europe, and certainly a huge budget. Unfortunately, this movie does not have the most relevant component: a decent screenplay. The beginning is confused and most of the situations and dialogs are not funny, being indeed ridiculous; when the execution of the heist is disclosed in the end, it is ludicrous; and the absurd plot itself is totally unbelievable and does not work. The direction is also very bad, with horrible and weird movements of camera. Steven Soderbergh began his career with exceptional works, but his last films are very deceptive (\"Full Frontal\"(2002); \"Solaris\"(2002)). My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Doze Homens e Outro Segredo\" (\"Twelve Men and Other Secret\")",
