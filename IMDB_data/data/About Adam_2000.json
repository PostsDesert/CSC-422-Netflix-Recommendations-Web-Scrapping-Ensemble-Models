        "reviewBody": "This film promised a bit more than it delivered. I never laughed out loud and didn't find it particularly witty. The character, Adam, is intriguing, but in the end, he remains a cipher, lacking any depth or even comedic exploration of character. Perhaps I'm picky, but I also prefer movies that employ actors from the character's country. For instance, hearing Kate Hudson's unsuccessful accent attempts threw me right out of the movie several times. The real jewel of this film is the all-too-brief performance of Charlotte Bradley. That she portrayed nuances in character in this otherwise fluff of a film is remarkable.",
