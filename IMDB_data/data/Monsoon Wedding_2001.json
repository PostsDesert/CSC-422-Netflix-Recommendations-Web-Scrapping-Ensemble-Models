When I came out of the theater I was happy, this film filled me with music, colors, a positive attitude towards life. It shows that it is possible to make a good film without special effects or sex scenes or blood dripping everywhere. If you have a story to tell, then you may have a good film, and Mira Nair has made it. The film is crowded with characters, the members of a family gathering together for the marriage of a young woman in New Delhi: we trace their stories, retrieve facts and feelings about their lives, get to know them, even when drama is behind the corner and the past seems to mix with the present. The family is not without flaws, yet the marriage is eventually celebrated as monsoon rain pours down to wash away their faults. Wet bride lucky bride, we say in Italy."
