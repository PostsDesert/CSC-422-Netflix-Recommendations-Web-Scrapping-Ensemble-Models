Company Man turned out be more of an Austin Powers or Top Secret, instead.\n\n Perhaps it was not a cinematic masterpiece. It was fun to watch, though, and gave me several really good belly laughs -- such as the \"real\" secret behind Gorbichev's alleged birthmark!\n\n The plot is silly & \"quirky,\" as some have noted, but it had a nice feel to it. Overall, I would call it a good little film."
