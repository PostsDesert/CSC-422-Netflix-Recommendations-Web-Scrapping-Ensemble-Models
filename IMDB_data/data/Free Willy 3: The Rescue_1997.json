I don't think this film will feature prominently on his CV. Basically the script keeps to a format and the format has become so stale everyone performs in a by-the-numbers fashion. I get the feeling this movie was made for profit rather than love of the characters. It focuses on a simplistic \"message\" rather than the more complex problem of looking at \"issues\".",
