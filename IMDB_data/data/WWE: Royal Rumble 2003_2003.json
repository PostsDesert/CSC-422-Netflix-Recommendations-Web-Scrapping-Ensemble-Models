But brought up some surprise eliminations a few years of predictable storylines and pretty much a on elevating one superstar, this wasn't the case this year instead the WWE produce some strong Storylines within the rumble itself always think it's a shame to have a main event at royal rumble when the rumble itself should be the main events. The main event itself Kevin Owens versus Roman Reigns had no reason not to take place at the next pay per view. It did nothing to elevate the rumble. I think one match at the start of the night and a second in between the men's and the women's rumble. Would be much better structure to the rumble nights .",
