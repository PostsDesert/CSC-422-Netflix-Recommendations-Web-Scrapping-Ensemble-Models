        "reviewBody": "This alternative classic from expert Bert I Gordon will not make anyone to forget . Dealing with mad dollmaker Dr Franz (John Hoyt) shrinks eight people , including our heroes (John Agar , June Kenny) . Along the way they battle lethal threats . Terror Comes In Small Packages! Doll dwarfs versus the crushing giant beats! .. Almost beyond the imagination . Can they escape the mad scientist ? The Dog ? The Rat ? . A strange adventure into the unknown !\n\nGripping fantastic tale about some good people exposed a ray suffering a mysterious shrinkage carried out by an insane dollmaker , as he shrinks them to the size of Barbie and Ken . Thrilling and suspenseful film made in similar style and folllowing the wake of Jack Arnold's The Incredible Shrinking Man. It contains fine and charming special effects highlight and good Art Direction. American International -from James H Nicholson , Samuel Z. Arkoff- classic of the 50s with numerous enjoyable scenes including astonishing appearances of giant animals chasing the diminutive people . Intelligent and brooding screenplay by George Worthing Yates and story by director Bert I. Gordon himself . Bert I Gordon pays tribute himself in the scenes in which protagonists see an earlier Bert I. Gordon film, The amazing Colossal Man (1957). Here shows up Susan Gordon, Director Bert I. Gordon's daughter, she was a last-minute substitute for another actress due to sickness , she died in 2011 , while her father Bert is still living at one hundred years of age .\n\nThe motion picture was decently written , produced and directed by prolific Bert I Gordon and he made the special effects effects too, in his usual primitive and traditional style . Bert is considered to be a rival to Ed Wood Jr in the schlock hall of fame .Bert realized various Sci-Fi , Fantasy and monsters movies , such as: ¨Food of the gods¨ in which H. G Wells's story is trashed in this ordinary movie . \" Cyclops , Viillage of the Giants, Magic Sword , Picture Mammy Dead , Big Bet , and Witching, the Necromancy\" . This is nice enough even to be deemed a camp movie. Rating : 6.5/10. Acceptable and passable .",
