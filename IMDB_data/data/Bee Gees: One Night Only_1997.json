It's just an amazing piece of musical footage and the vocals are well,legendary! I'm thirteen and i still like going back to those times. I mean really..you can't find high voices like that anymore when it comes to modern music. The songs are great and there are also special appearances of celebrities at the concert,people like Celine Dion as well as Olivia Newton-John from the musical \"Grease\".\n\nSo if you like BeeGees,you should definitely get this or it would be a \"tradgedy\" not to do so.",
