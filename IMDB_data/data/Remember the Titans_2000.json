        "reviewBody": "\"Remember The Titans\" is one of the two best films to have a chance to win an oscar for best picture.\n\nDenzel Washington leads a cast that is young, fresh, talented and determined to make this movie a success. \"Remember The Titans\" is laced with strong performances from Will Patton, Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris, Donald Faison and Greg Alan Williams.\n\nBased on a true story \"Remember The Titans\" follows the 1971 T.C. Williams High School Titans football team and their struggles with integration. Washington is Herman Boone, who has run up against racism after he has been brought in to coach the Titans. Patton is Bill Yoast, the man Boone replaced as head coach. \n\nWashington and Patton are just two pieces of the puzzle, which makes \"Remember The Titans\" a real gem. However, the strength and real beauty of \"Remember The Titans\" does not come from Washington or Patton, but the Titan football players because they are the ones who give the strongest performances in the film.\n\nI must say that the best performance of the whole movie other than Washington and Patton is the young actress who portrayed Bill Yoast's daughter, Hayden Panitierre. In \"Remember The Titans\" this young actress single handidly made it worth watching this film. Her talent shines through and her presence on screen is as fresh as the daily air; furthermore, every time she is on screen she sparkles. It is so pleasurable to see talent like this being discovered.\n\nI hesitated to see \"Remember The Titans\" because I didn't want to see another football film, but it is more than just another football film.\n\n \"Remember The Titans\" is a special film that has special performances and is well worth every dollar you spend to rent this film."
