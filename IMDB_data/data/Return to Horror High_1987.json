As an avid fan of cult films, that is exactly what this film is. Early appearances by George Clooney and later appearances by \"Dr. Ben Casey\" Vince Edwards, \"Marcia Brady\" Maureen McCormick, \"Mo Green\" himself, Alex Rocco, and that kid from \"Alice\", Philip McKeon, all star in this film about a killer who returns to the high school where he killed years ago to terrorize a movie crew. The finale is a hell of a surprise."
