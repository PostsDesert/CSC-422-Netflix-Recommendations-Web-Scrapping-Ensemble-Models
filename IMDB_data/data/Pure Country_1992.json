I first bought it in VHS and then on DVD (go for DVD, the sound is great).\n\nThis is a simple story of a famous country singer who goes underground because while he has everything, he really has nothing. He gets drunk and ends up on the shrinking ranch of a beautiful cowgirl. He stays anonymous and gets back in touch with the world. Meanwhile the s**t hits the fan with his touring show. The plot has to do some twisting to work all this out but the basic appeal of the film, a good man getting back in touch with what's real, has universal appeal.\n\nYou may find yourself wanting to watch this movie about once a year. I know I do. Highly recommended.",
