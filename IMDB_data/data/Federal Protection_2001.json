One thing about the movie is that it left me wondering what in the world did girls see in the husband?\n\n Pretty much everything involving the mafiosos was enjoyable, especially the park scene. I might rent the movie again just for them. If you are looking for something to kill some time while enjoying a brew, this is a good choice."
