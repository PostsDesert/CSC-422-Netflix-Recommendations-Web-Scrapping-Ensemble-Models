We feel included, and in this performance we experience a form of audience participation that I've never seen before in a stage presentation by a famous singer. Through her music Jewel shares from her explorations as to who she is, and by extension we each get to know something heart-felt about our selves. She knows we are each a part of something much more comprehensive than \"self\", and that one's sense of and contribution to community matters. In this video we see Jewel shine, and enjoy her amazing music as she touches our souls. Bravo!",
