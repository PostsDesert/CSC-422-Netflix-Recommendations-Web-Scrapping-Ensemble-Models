        "reviewBody": "I have not seen someone this funny (especially a young adult) in a very long time. I tuned in less than a month ago to see what Jennette McCurdy was up to and Ariana Grande's character totally shocked me. I had no idea what she was doing. At first I thought she was mentally-challenged then I read her say that she was playing dumb. She would stare into space and hesitate and wave her arms in the air and talk with an inflection that reminded me so much of Emo Phillips, the comedian (I could never understand him and I could not tolerate his inflection) or even Pee-Wee Herman to an extent. Ariana is so unique for her age and she's quick and an extremely good actor and comic. She is going to be huge at whatever she puts her mind to. (She is a better actor than any of the \"Friends\" actors were during their first two seasons.) I would give this series a \"10\" but I think the writing and themes can be poor. Producer Dan Schneider has a pretty warped sense of humor. Some of the stories and lines give bad examples to kids, imo: Sam and Cat are very materialistic, Sam's character basically hates people (eg. that part shocked me), and some of the other older characters seem very shallow. Plus, these characters do not need to be making butt jokes. (It's totally inappropriate for young kids.) But some of the stories, lines and sight gags are extremely funny! The acting and laughs sold me after the 3rd episode that I watched. This series had \"success\" written all over it due to Jennette and Ariana. (I would have replaced the writers if the series went on to a second season. I'm an adult male and I'll watch some of these adolescent shows for a change of pace just to see what they're up to. Lord knows Hollywood has been striking out with adult TV sitcoms and reality shows.) I can't believe that they couldn't bring Jennette and Ariana back together for more Sam and Cat!",
