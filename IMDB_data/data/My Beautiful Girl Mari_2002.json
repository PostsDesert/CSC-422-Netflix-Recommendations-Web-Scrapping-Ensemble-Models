        "reviewBody": "Perhaps due to the fact that I couldn't access the English subtitles with the original Korean voice actors, I found the voice work engorging and mild. Also, I was surprised that a film that deals with the theme of growing up and moving on (a subject that usually gains instant sympathy from myself), didn't particular move me. I compare this film to Miyizaki's masterpiece \"My Neighbor Tortoro\" where fantastical characters accompany the overall theme of common childhood hardships. In \"My Beautiful Girl Mari\", the fantasy may or may not exist, but I found it not really relevant to the progression of the story. In fact, the story did have more depth and interest then the images and occurrences that took place in the metaphysical universe in which the protagonists meet Mari, an odd-looking floating female in white. Maybe because of the nature of the film's two protagonists, I couldn't really connect with them connecting emotionally to the nature of the fantasy. Certain aspects in the film's emotion do succeed however, such as the important friendship between the the boys. It makes the film's ending more touching and meaningful. The soft, soothing music also complements the story's tone and animation framework.\n\n\"Mari\" is interesting due to it's unique artistic style. The animation is not the common type used, and it makes for a more interesting visual appeal. I saw a lot of potential however in the story and deeper meaning of the film, and found it quite lacking.",
