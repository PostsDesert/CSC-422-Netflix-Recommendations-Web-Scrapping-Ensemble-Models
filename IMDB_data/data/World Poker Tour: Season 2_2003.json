        "reviewBody": "This was really fascinating when it first appeared. It's a year-round series of tournament play of Texas Hold'em. There is a series of payouts and the winner gets a WPT Bracelet. This is like watching how the magicians construct their tricks. The game really exploded when tiny cameras were first used to see the players' hold cards. One sees the players do their bluffing and execute their strategies. There is real tension and real personalities. It was eye-opening and lots of fun. It rode the popularity of the game from movies such as Rounders and earlier poker shows. However, the novelty does wear off as everybody learns how to play the game. With internet poker exploding, the tournaments start to be won by any number of random newbies. The familiar players are no longer the favorites and they're often handicap by their appearances on previous shows. With no new big characters, the shows become less and less compelling.",
