        "reviewBody": "This movie to me was bit boring. Not because it doesn't have lot of action, but something about it was awkward, forced and slow paced. Maybe for people who're familiar with the plot and the culture this movie hits the mark, but for someone who has no preconceived notion or expectation, it's who cares from start to finish. These guy's problems and issues are so remote, and their machismo so utterly stupid, that I felt like saying, if you want to insist on being so stupid, be my guest.\n\nIf this is the classic way they made movies, I'm glad that it's not made this way anymore. Each scene was so boring. There wasn't anything to pull you in to the story.\n\nWhat happened in the end happened but again it was who cares. If they're that bull headed, it would have happened sooner or later. Yeah, these guys had no brains whatsoever. And they were supposed to be a leader in their respective society.\n\nI'm a fan of Andy Lau, but this movie didn't show his character at all. Everybody did a real wooden acting that added to the yawn. No, this is not a film noir, they didn't flesh out the characters and the story, and the flat mood went from start to finish.\n\nNot recommended unless you're familiar with how this story goes, and watching it as a follow up to where the TV series left off, or just watching it for Leslie Chung (and Andy Lau).",
