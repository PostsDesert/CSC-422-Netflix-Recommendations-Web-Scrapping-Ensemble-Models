It was a huge hit when it came out and it was acclaimed by critics as well.\n\nAfter seeing it, I wondered if this movie would be a success if it came out today. The characters act in weird and sometimes nonsensical ways. Rishi Kapoor's character's actions really have no justification. I did like Shashi Kapoor's character, though.\n\nOverall, this makes me wonder if we see a lot of older movies through rose tinted glasses.",
