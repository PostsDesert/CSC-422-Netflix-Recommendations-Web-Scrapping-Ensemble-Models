As horrible as it is, it was wonderful to see them learn through their many mistakes. Additionally, the writer was incredibly annoying...someone needs to inform her that her job was writing the script, not directing the movie. Anyway, this series was wonderful and a great behind-the-scenes look at making a movie. Unfortunately, The Battle of Shaker Heights wasn't the greatest movie and failed at the box office, most likely directly contributing to the show not being renewed. Still, I highly recommend this season!"
