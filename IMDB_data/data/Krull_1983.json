        "reviewBody": "I grew up in the 80s with my grandparents renting this on VHS over and over again. It's one of thouse movies that took me back then by storm. It has a bit of Star Wars and a bit of Sword in the stone/King Arthur mixed in to this perfect fantasy like adventure movie. From start to finish there is a pretty fast pace through everything. And no part felt boring for a child in the 80s in this movie. Great effects for it's time that might look outdated by todays CGI standards, but that shouldent take away much if your looking for a Classic Sci-fi fantasy movie from the 80s. And this one actually has the most amazing weapon used in any movie out there period. I think all actors did great in this movie and some of them became big or known stars later on in their carrer. And Ken Marshall should have been one of them in my opinion. Krull has a very special vibe to it, that is hard to describe in words. So give it a go if you havent, and enjoy the adventure in this Classic tale of good vs exil.",
