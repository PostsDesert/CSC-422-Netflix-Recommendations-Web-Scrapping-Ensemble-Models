Three DVDs teaching about the Jews as a people, from ancient times to the present. Beginning with the origin of civilization in Mesopotamia, the viewer is led through biblical and medieval times. This stream of information opens out in the present situation of Jewish life. \n\nTo help understand Jewish history and to get rid of any prejudice against Jews, which is an important part of education, \"Heritage\" can and should be recommended."
