        "reviewBody": "I really liked this movie. It narrates the story of the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955.\n\nWith regard to the casting choices, the story and the performances, it is stellar indeed, and deserving of a much higher rating. This movie's Achilles heel is the hubris of its director, Clark Johnson. Overdone, movie treatments, and stylized effects used to 'enhance' the story only served to take away from, an already engaging film of resistance, resourcefulness and focus on the successes of a galvanized Civil Rights movement. I watch it for brilliant performances of Jeffrey Wright and Carmen Ejogo, who went on to play Coretta King in Selma, with David Ouelowo (even more brilliant as MLK). I watch it for the choice to add Bayard Rustin, in the narrative.\n\nThis movie was wonderfully acted by all, even the small parts were done brilliantly, some of that was due to the director, and editor. The writing is beautiful and human and rich with meaning. All of this serves to make the mis-steps more jarring.\n\nSo, while this movie remains watchable and even enjoyable, it does so despite its director than because of him. PS stop the movie before Dr. King rides the bus to the future and greets young people to 'rap' with. That part was truly cringeworthy. (shudder)",
