It was well acted, shot and wrote and the mix of innocence and anger were well represented.\n\nThis film was one that i had eagerly anticipated watching and i was not disappointed by it. At times it was painful to watch but was compelling all the same as it really drew the audience in. Cillian Murphy was excellent as the mentally challenged Pig as even in his madness you are drawn to him and his obvious similarity to a confused child. Elaine Cassidy was equally well cast as the introverted Runt.\n\nI would recommend this film although admittedly it will not be to everyones tastes.",
