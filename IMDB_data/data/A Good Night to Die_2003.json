        "reviewBody": "A Good Night to Die is a down and dirty New York film. It is about a likable hit man named Ronnie, his not so bright protege, August, and an eventful day in their lives.\n\nMichael Rappaport gives the most powerful performance of his career as the dim witted and intense student of the hit man arts. Gary Stretch plays the main character who goes to extreme lengths to protect his protege whom he feels responsible for bringing into their world. I've never heard of Mr. Stretch but I'm sure we all will very soon. He seems to jump off the screen and sit in your lap.\n\nA entirely unrecognizable Ralph Macchio plays a psychotic killer with his partner (you never really know their exact relationship, but whatever it is, it's really weird) played by Ally Sheedy (always a bonus to see Ralph Macchio and Ally Sheedy play a murderous, psychotic duo)\n\nDeborah Harry and Seymour Casell play rival mob bosses but this is more than your standard \"the mob is after me\" kind of movie.\n\nThe movie is filmed mainly in the streets of New York City. You can practically smell the city. One particular rooftop assassination scene really stands out. There was something very disturbing and wrong about how the person was done in.\n\nI highly recommend this movie.",
