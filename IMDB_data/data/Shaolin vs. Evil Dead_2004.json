Luckily, the unintentional comedy works wonders, such as the hilarious dubbing, a scene in which Gordon Liu asks a boy to urinate on the floor because he needs to use \"virgin's pee\", a scene in which he instructs his soldiers by using a rhyme that sounds like a high-school cheerleaders chant and a small child chasing after another boy calling him 'mummy' and covered in what is seemingly spunk. ***",
