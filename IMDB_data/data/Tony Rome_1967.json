The character portrayed by Sinatra, and the dialogue in general, presents a good example of what the typical American Male thought of as \"cool\" in the early 60's.\n\nTrue, it's not what we find entertaining today, but that's not why I like to watch old movies. I watch old films because they have an extraordinary ability to take you to a time when the world, and people in general, had a very different view of things and also what was fashionable at that time.",
