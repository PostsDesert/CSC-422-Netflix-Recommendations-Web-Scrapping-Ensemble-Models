        "reviewBody": "If you are a fan of Mr Lynch like me this is essential viewing. It includes interviews with Lynch's friends, family and associates like Jack Fisk, Barry Gifford, Mel Brooks among others, and examines his life as an artist in films, paintings and photography. It was mainly filmed during the making of Lost Highway and most of the features are set around that film, but there is also some other scenes like the reunion of Eraserhead, where Lynch along with some of the cast and crew return to the Stables location where it was filmed and reminisce over the trials of the making of the film. Also featured is Lynch's trip to Prague along with the composer on most of his films, Angelo Badalamenti, and his love of the sound and music which is so important in his films. His paintings and photography are shown, too, and his fascination with ants and animals in his art. There is a rare look at his early short films, Six Men Getting Sick, The Alphabet and The Grandmother, and his former wife Peggy's views on them. This is a fascinating and interesting behind the scenes look at this distinctive filmmaker, artist and photographer's work.",
