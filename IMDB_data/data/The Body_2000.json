        "reviewBody": "I have some contradictory feelings about this one. I like how brutalist it is. By that i mean how it always puts the film making process in front of the film itself. That by itself it nothing new but i think that Utsushimi does it particularly well. I also like the lead actress. Really charismatic. But the film in itself is kind of rough. There are a lot of long dragging (to me) uninteresting scenes, such as the dance rehearsal one. Even the Araki scene is kind of meh and i'm' a huge Araki fan. The thing is that all we actually see him do is photograph nude models. And yes that is mostly what he is know for. BUT, the scene does not make it look interesting in any way. The photos he took that day probably look really cool, but the scene does not. And i know it is no impossible to film a photographer working and make it interesting because i've seen Arakimentari and it is pretty nice. Anyway other than that the film has some other real cool moments that i'm not mentioning. The problem with it, for me, is that the good only barely exceed the bad. And while what i do love about it i REALLY LOVE, what i dislike about it i really dislike. Overrall it is a decent film. Definetly an interesting and unique one. It's just gonna take a while longer than usual for me to revisit it.",
