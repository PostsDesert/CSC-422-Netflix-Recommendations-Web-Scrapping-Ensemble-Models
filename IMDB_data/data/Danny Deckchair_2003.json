Its a light, full-hearted film meant to make you feel good about life and love and all that stuff. What I loved about it was that it was all that stuff and not such a big production! The initial premise was so outrageous that it was unbelievable but the rest, well it could be measured with a yard stick.....maybe a yard pole. If you didn't enjoy it......well maybe your cynicism has become more than a hobby.",
