The sequel to Short Circuit is an improvement on the first film, if only for the inclusion of the then beautiful Cynthia Gibb as Sandy Banatoni (whom I had a HUGE crush on when I first saw the film at the age of around 8). But there are hundreds more memorable moments from the film which came flooding back to me as I watched, much to the annoyance of my housemates.\n\nGreat film, maybe not in a 'Pulp Fiction/Donnie Darko' sort of way, but great in a 'Bill & Ted/Flight of the Navigator' way, that it's a testament of my youth and will be shown to my kids when I eventually have some!\n\np.s. anyone notice a small similarity between Cynthia Gibb in this film and young Potter star Emma Watson? Weird...",
