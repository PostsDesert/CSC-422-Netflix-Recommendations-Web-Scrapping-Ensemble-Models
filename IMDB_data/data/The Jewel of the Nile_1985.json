Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas are taking it easy on their yacht, but soon become a bit bored with their now simple lives. Turner gets an invitation from a suspicious sheik in the Middle East who has a dastardly plan up his sleeves. Danny DeVito is also along for the ride once again as everyone is searching for the seemingly unobtainable jewel. Likeable performances are the main attraction, but the film is a large step behind \"Romancing the Stone\". 2.5 out of 5 stars."
