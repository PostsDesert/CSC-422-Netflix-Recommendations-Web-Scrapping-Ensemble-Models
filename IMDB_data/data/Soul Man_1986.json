        "reviewBody": "This is the type of movie that only could've been made in the 80's, 'cause if it were released in present day the NAACP and other African-American organizations would've fried this movie like an egg.\n\nIt's not terribly offensive, but there are moments where racism is condoned, though it doesn't blatantly show it. It tries to show us, in after-school special format, that it is proving some moral by showing us the raunchy stereotypes. Like reverse psychology. But it also tries to get laughs from those stereotypes. So it pretty much loses the point.\n\nI laughed a few times, and I wasn't bored. This is a pretty lame comedy with a plot as predictable as night and day, but it moves along in a slick '80's teen-bopper flick style. The premise is preposterous and the film gets more preposterous by the minute, but some laughs are drawn from that stupidity. However, there are no big laughs. And the whole film plays like a sitcom, trying way too hard, and failing more often than it should.",
