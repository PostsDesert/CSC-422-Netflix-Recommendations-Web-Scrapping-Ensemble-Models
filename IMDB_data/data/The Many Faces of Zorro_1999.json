I guess it would have been better if I've watched the drama first, as this one combined everything in such a small length. So, at times, the story got confusing and not easy to keep up with.\n\nThat said, the plot was kind of interesting. The main character, Ito, and his \"teacher\", the woman who was trying to hold on to her past, were two different people and still, almost similar. In the end, it was pointed out that it was a battle between the two of them, at least from the guy's point of view.\n\nIn addition, the performances were really good from everyone in the cast.\n\nSo, five out of ten.",
