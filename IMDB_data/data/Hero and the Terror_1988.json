Chuck Norris is at his prime in this movie, a performance he was only able to top in Delta Force One and Two. Billy Drago, as Doctor Highwater, leads a solid supporting cast in making this movie a huge success. Every time Chuck and Billy team up they create an explosion of action and emotion. I've watched this movie several times and every time I come away with something new I have learned about the characters or the plot itself. This movie has an awful high babe factor as well. Bottom line: Drago and Norris are an hit on screen!"
