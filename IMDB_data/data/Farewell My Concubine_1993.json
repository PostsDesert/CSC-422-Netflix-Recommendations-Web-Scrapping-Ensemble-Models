        "reviewBody": "While 'Ba wang bie ji' (aka 'Farewell My Concubine') has been labelled as a tragic epic what really makes it stand out is its depth and attention to detail at the same time while telling an engaging story. Like Akira Kurosawa's 'Ran' ''Ba wang bie ji' Kaige Chen's film is like a tragic poem on canvas. The vivid colours, the emotionally moving opera songs, the vivacious cinematography and luscious visuals all compare the film to a beautiful painting. Lillian Lee's superb screenplay (adapted from her own book) involves the viewer in Chinese history and the lives of Dieyi and Xiaolou. It beautifully introduces the viewer to the history of Chinese opera and also demonstrates the radical transformation that took place before the emergence of New China.\n\nLeslie Cheung gives a magnificent understated performance that is skillfully restrained. Even though his characters displays shades of darkness and malice, there is a humanity that draws immense sympathy from the viewer as one witnesses his life falling into pieces. Fengyi Zhang too does a great task as Xiaolou, who is in many ways Dieyi's polar opposite and his best friend (and love of his life). Gong Li is sublime and makes full use of her time and powerful expressions.\n\nI had been postponing watching the film because of its time length and I wanted to reserve 3 hours so that I can watch it in one go and devote my full attention to it. I was right to do so because this film deserves the viewer's full attention. It might be an overwhelming experience but one that is enlightening and worthy of the almost three hours (avoid the cut version)."
