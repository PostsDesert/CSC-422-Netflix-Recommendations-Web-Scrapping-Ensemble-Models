My wish if you can say that was not fulfilled, and instead every time something started happening another scene would pop up. I think that there is a unrated version of this movie out there, but I only found an \"R\" rated version. My vote of a \"9\" was because of Julie Strain's scenes and some of the other girls. The other reason that I gave it such a high score is because it is almost perfect, with the rest that had either been cut altogether or is in the unrated version would make it a \"10\". The movie was a very good look at another aspect of Julie, so rent but be forewarned I think it is still lacking enough erotic feel.",
