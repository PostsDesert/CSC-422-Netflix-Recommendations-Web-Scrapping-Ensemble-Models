One night, she is raped in an alley while going back home after hours and when she arrives at home, she is raped again by another criminal. However, she reacts and kills the assaulter with a flatiron. The disturbed Thana loses her sanity and uses the rapist pistol to kill men on the streets of New York. \n\n\"Angel of Vengeance\" is a cult-movie by Abel Ferrara with elements of \"Death Wish\" when a simple woman goes insane after being raped twice in one day and she uses the criminal's gun to kill every man that makes a pass on her. I have just watched this film for the fourth or fifth time on VHS and it has not aged. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Sedução e Vingança\" (\"Seduction and Revenge\")\n\nNote: On 12 May 2017, I saw this film again.",
