        "reviewBody": "Last year I remember watching Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman for the first time. I liked it very much but for some strange reason I seemed to enjoy it a whole lot more when I saw it the second time! RBGG is basically about Raju, (Shahrukh Khan) a young man who comes to Bombay in hopes of becoming an engineer. There he meets Renu, (Juhi Chawla) who helps him get a job and they fall in love with each other over time. Raju continues to climb the ladders of success until he is framed for the collision of a newly constructed bridge in the area. He is then taken to court where a case is filed against him. What will happen next? Watch RBGG to find out....\n\nThis film was surely a genuine treat to watch. I must say that SRK and Juhi make one of the sweetest on screen couples! I just love watching all of the films they have made together; their on-screen chemistry is just so amazing! Moving on to the music... RBGG's music was so wonderful! The best songs in the movie would have to be \"Loveria\" and \"I Love You.\" Not to mention the entire cast of the film made outstanding performances! An excellent and very-well made film, but not better than Yes Boss!\n\nOverall Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman deserves a 9/10!!!",
