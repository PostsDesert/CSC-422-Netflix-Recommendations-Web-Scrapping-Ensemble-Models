        "reviewBody": "Though 'Hercules (1997)' struggles to provide even one truly great song, the film is a colourful and enjoyable adaptation of Greek mythology. Its highlight is probably Hades, the easily enraged god of the underworld who's brilliantly voiced by a fast-talking and scene-chewing James Woods. The movie is mostly light-hearted entertainment; it has an underlying message, but it isn't as focused upon as in some of Disney's other fare. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. Sometimes, you just want your animated musicals to be fun. After a somewhat slow start, the movie picks up the pace and is engaging right until its finish. It also features a few well-achieved and, even, exciting set-pieces. It's a solid entry in the Disney archives. 7/10",
