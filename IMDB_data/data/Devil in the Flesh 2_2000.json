I didn't see the first movie with Rose McGowan (though I plan to) or the one that was made in the 80's. I guess they're all the same story, but it would be fun to compare. Not a bad movie at all. From the opening credits, you can tell it's not a blockbuster... some of the best movies are like that.",
