        "reviewBody": "I don't know whether the director wanted to make this movie a horror movie or a psychological horror movie. I guess this director couldn't make up his mind and the movie ended up full of promise but never delivers!\n\nAll the actors give very good performances. Eric Roberts is a very good actor who seems to get stuck doing mediocre movies. He plays a small part in this film but he gives a very good performance with what he's given with. Heck! Eric Roberts always gives a good performance whatever movie he's in! The rest of the actors are very attractive young men or women. There is quite a bit of suggested homoeroticism in this movie, but nothing too overt. \n\nA young man comes to Wall Street in his quest to become a stockbroker. He ends up working for this strange firm that has unique ideas of what it is to be a good employee to this company. I wish they would've shown more of the material rewards of being a stockbroker, it would make the audience understand why this young man wanted to be part of this strange company.\n\nThe ending of this film is unbelieveable! Not a good unbelieveable, but a bad unbelieveable! Okay, it's a good idea to arm oneself with a silver dagger to go up against werewolves, not just a silver pen! That's all I can tell you about the ending, you'll have to see it for yourself if you are curious enough to rent this two hour time waster.\n\nThe director should have shown some sort of werewolf special effects. I don't know why he didn't. Then if the director is not going to show any special effects, then he should've turn this film into a psychological horror film of a young man getting sucked into the evil lifestyle of this stockbroker firm.\n\nThis film just didn't work. This film showed wonderful shots of downtown Manhattan at night and Wall Street during the day and showed great actors, but the story sucked big time! This movie is an interesting failure.\n\nWatch it if you're interested in looking at hunky guys in suits or shirtless!\n\nI give this movie a D+!"
