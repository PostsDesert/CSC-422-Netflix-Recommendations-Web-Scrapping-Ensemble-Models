Robotech is a very detailed series in Japan it's called Macross. One day I would like to see the japanese version. I have all of them on DVD except volume 8 which is part of the Robotech Masters series(season 2). The charaters are so unique and different and the love story is so much better than those other cliches used in today's anime, video games and movies. If you love watching the series you should also try Robotech Battlecry, even though you are using a character that doesn't even exist in the series it's a good game for any Robotech fan. If you are new to anime, Robotech is the perfect anime to start with. Robotech was one of my first."
