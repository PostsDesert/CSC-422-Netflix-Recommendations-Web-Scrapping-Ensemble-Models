Whats happenening these days? \"Sabrina, The Teenage Witch\", \"Buffy?\" \"Charmed?\"...Jeez, give me a break!\n\nDarren McGavin absolutely made this his own - one of the most under-rated actors in history. His verbals with boss Vincenzo (Simon Oakland) were legendary. You KNEW Vincenzo loved him like a brother! Each week a new monster/creature of the night and each week, crucifix, silver bullet or just plain insult, Kolchak had the \"beast of the week\" under wraps before you could say \"Bela Lugosi\". You just KNEW it was safe to go outside again.\n\nOK, so it tended towards the \"campy\" sometimes? sheesh, this was 1974 for God's sakes! This show ruled and if you are unfortunate enough to be less than 40, then bad luck!"
