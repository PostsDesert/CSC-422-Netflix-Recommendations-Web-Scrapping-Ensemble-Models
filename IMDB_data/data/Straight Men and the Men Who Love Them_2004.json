Not all of the shorts listed on the jacket are featured on the DVD.\n\nThe menu is more difficult to navigate than most.\n\nThe shorts that are included are very dark. Particularly Truth or Dare (NOT Consequences as the jacket lists it) The quality of that is also very grainy.\n\nThe short In the Name of the Father is actually quite good but again the cinematic quality is off and the opening titles are actually difficult to read as they just projected onto to opening scene in the film.\n\nPopcorn & Coke & Uninhibited both feel like they were designed as interstitials to be shown during a real feature's opening trailers.\n\nMy Straight Boyfriend is listed on the jacket but not included in the DVD.\n\nOverall, NOT a very impressive performance.",
