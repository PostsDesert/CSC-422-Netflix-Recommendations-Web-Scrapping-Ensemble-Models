For those who know the series, the villains of the episodes shown here are Firearm, Flashpoint and Clockwise. Fortunately, I had never seen the series before, so it was all new to me. \"Sting of the Black Scorpion\" is the ultimate \"guilty pleasure\". It's guilty because the stories are strictly from Cornsville, the production values are bad (they even use stock footage for some explosions) and the special effects are straight out of Power Rangers (not that I have ever watched Power Rangers, either). And it's a pleasure because it's knowingly campy and never takes itself too seriously. Clockwise, in particular, has some funny lines: \"Tick Tock Tick Tock Tick...No More Talk!\". But mostly it's a pleasure because of Michelle Lintel in the title role. With her pouty lips and voluptuous figure, she fills out her fetishistic leather outfit WONDERFULLY, and although the actual fight scenes are fifth-rate (sometimes the kicks don't even connect), she sells them with pure attitude. She brings likability to officer Darcy Walker and conviction to the Black Scorpion. So, get in touch with your inner 15-year-old boy or your inner fetishist (or both), and you may love this show.
