        "reviewBody": "\"The Last of the Mohicans\" is set \"in the Year of Grace 1757\", in what was to become the eastern United States. At that time, the \"Indians\" (aka Native Americans), English, and French were forming different warring alliances; mainly, they were trying to kill each other off, and gain control of the land. The \"Indians\" depicted in the film are \"Mohican\" and \"Huron\" Native Americans. The title gives away the fate of the Mohicans, who are depicted as a dying tribe, with a couple of remaining Chiefs. The \"Indians\" may have been dying off due to the absence of women among their tribes, which may also explain their constant lust for \"white women\", as shown throughout the film.\n\nThe two main Indians are \"Bad Indian\" Wallace Berry (as Magua) and \"Good Indian\" Albert Roscoe (as Uncas). Dark-haired white woman Barbara Bedford (as Cora), who \"underplays\" to the point of comatose, is the main object they desire. Ms. Bedford and Good Indian Roscoe enjoy an \"interracial\" flirtation, which is also underplayed to the point of comatose. Mr. Berry is the most romantic member of the cast, employing a funny \"come hither\" look during one scene. A main storyline involves the task of rescuing Bedford and her Yellow-haired sister (Lillian Hall), and returning them to the safety of their British father.\n\nAlong the way, a Huron massacre is shown; this is one of the film's gruesome highlights. \"The Last of the Mohicans\" main strength is that it is stunningly presented, by Maurice Tourneur. Mr. Tourneur's choice of story material may be lacking, but he always knows how to make films look beautiful. Clarence Brown, on his way to a successful career of his own, assisted. \n\n***** The Last of the Mohicans (11/21/20) Maurice Tourneur, Clarence Brown ~ Barbara Bedford, Wallace Berry, Albert Roscoe",
