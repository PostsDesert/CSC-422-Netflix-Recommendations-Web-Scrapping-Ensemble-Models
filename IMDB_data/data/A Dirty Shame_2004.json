        "reviewBody": "Tracey Ullman does some priceless double-takes in this John Waters comedy, playing uptight wife and mother in a Baltimore suburb who gets a rap on the noggin and becomes a sex addict. A shabby-looking enterprise with scrappy editing, this would seem amateurish even for a first-time director, but Waters certainly doesn't seem to mind. As a filmmaker, he is gleefully puckish, with a heightened sense of the ridiculous, and as usual he gets his cast to ride right along on his coattails. Selma Blair is Ullman's daughter, who has \"mutilated her mammaries\"; Chris Isaak is Tracey's husband who also gets a knock on the head and dreams of musclemen posing; Johnny Knoxville is a sex guru/auto mechanic; Suzanne Shepherd is Ullman's mother, Big Ethel, who runs the Park and Pay. Relatively short film isn't compact (the final reel is just a lot of hamming and running around) but the first-half has some laugh-out-loud moments and the whole picture benefits from Ullman's work--she's a stitch. **1/2 from ****",
