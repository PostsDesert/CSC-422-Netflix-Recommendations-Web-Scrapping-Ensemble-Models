        "reviewBody": "I gave this movie a 1 out of 10 rating.\n\n Storyline: Mildly interesting, though predictable and not too original.\n\nActing: Awful? Horrible? Pathetic? Take your pick.\n\nCinematography: Decent for a shot-on-video movie, but low quality audio and bad lighting really drag it down.\n\nSpecial effects are non-existent, but not entirely cheesy due to clever use of camera positioning, etc.\n\nPacing: It's way too long (135 minutes)\n\n Pros: Good insight into the psyche of someone who is forced to kill in order to survive. Comic relief provided by \"The Reaper\" who dresses in a Grim Reaper caul, but with psychadelic socks that change every scene.\n\nCons: Bad acting, poor cinematography.\n\n As movies go, the only people who will find it interesting are the very VERY small group of people who are 1) really into vampires and 2) delve into the psychological aspects of reluctant killing. If this doesn't describe you, stay far far away from this film.",
