It´s a fast-paced crime story about the rise and fall of an Afro American godfather and everybody who loves such blaxploitations goodies like \"Dolemite\", \"Blacula\" or \"Foxy Brown\" should give it a look! Once more, main actor is the ultimate coolness and it´s no wonder why Quentin Tarantino digged him out for his funny \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" movie. Unfortunately, they don´t make stuff like this anymore! Movies like \"Dead Presidents\" or \"New Jack City\" are nothing else but failed attempts to exhume the blaxploitation genre! Better watch the originals again, they are da real deal!"
