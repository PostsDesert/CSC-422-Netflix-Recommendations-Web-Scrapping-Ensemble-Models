This is when the series starts to pick up steam. Watching the show, you can't help but laugh at Briscoe's remarks or feel the passion of McCoy. Both of these men want justice, and will do everything within limits to bring the wrongdoers to justice. What I really like about the show is the wonderful twists and turns that they throw to the audience, as well as the \"ripped from the headlines\" episodes. Even though you have 2 more in the \"Law And Order\" franchise, the original is STILL the best!",
