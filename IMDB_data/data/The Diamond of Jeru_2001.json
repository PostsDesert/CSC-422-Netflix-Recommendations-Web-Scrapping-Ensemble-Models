        "reviewBody": "Good update of 1950's style jungle films and serials, set in the 50's no less. Though the story is somewhat standard \"Jungle Jim\" type fare (a bickering couple in search of diamonds goes on a jungle trek, runs into headhunters, and must be rescued by hero and his trusty sidekick), it doesn't disappoint in the adventure department. The actors were very well cast and give lively performances all around and the production values were a great improvement over the studio B-grade pictures of the past. Billy Zane is perfect as the hero and a sequel would be quite welcome. Note: Paris Jefferson, mostly known to United States audiences as Athena in the XENA, WARRIOR PRINCESS series, plays the wife."
