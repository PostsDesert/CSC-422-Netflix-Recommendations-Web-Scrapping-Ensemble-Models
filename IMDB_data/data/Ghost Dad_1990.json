I have seen this movie several times and Bill Cosby is funny, A single dad trying to raise 3 children until he has his accident and becomes a ghost. The adventures that Cosby goes through in this movie while he is a ghost are interesting. It is a great film for children of all ages. So, see this movie if you haven't already and I think you will be very surprised at the adventures of Cosby and the other Characters in this film."
