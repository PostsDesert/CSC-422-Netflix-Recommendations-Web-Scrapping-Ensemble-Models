        "reviewBody": "This was one of the movies I was so sure was going to be stupid and annoying but it turned out to be such fine comedy I've already watched it three times in the past week or two. So many good lines. Tom writes a play called Goodnight Bassington - a comedy in about three acts with a tragic ending. George paints Lady Godiva on a bicycle, despite the fact that a bicycle seat IS a little hard on her historical background. Gilda says that she went to see the above-mentioned painting of Lady Godiva with a friend. \"She loved it. We haven't spoken since,\" Gilda tells George, who begins to pout. He does a fair amount of pouting throughout the film.\n\nEaglebauer also makes for some fine humour in some scenes near the end, but we never get to see the man. We only hear him bellowing out a joyous song about \"falling leaves and fading trees! Goodbye, summer, goodbye!\"\n\nBut besides all that this really wacky movie is a delight and I sure wish they'd re-release it because it's so good.\n\nSo. There's only one thing I have to say to you. Immorality may be fun, but it's not fun enough to replace one hundred per cent virtue and three square meals a day.",
