Not only for you, but for your entire circle of friends and family members, not to mention all of your representatives in Congress, too. A low budget documentary with its heart in the right place, Tying the Knot uses interviews with real people and sound bites aplenty to show how weak, hypocritical and just plain wrong the arguments against gay marriage are; and why the issue is one of dignity, humanity and respect, not politics or religion. A wonderful intro to the subject, Tying the Knot is moving, informative and may well inspire you to action!",
