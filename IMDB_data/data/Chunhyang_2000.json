        "reviewBody": "This is a lush and beautiful Korean fairy tale with \"Romeo and Juliet\" like qualities. As I understand it, it is traditionally told in \"Pansori\" style with a rhythmic singer/storyteller accompanied by a drummer. The film uses a pansori concert as the framework to tell the tale and interweaves the action with the singer's narration to good effect. The story is classic, star-crossed lovers separated by societies rules. A governor's son falls in love with a concubine's daughter and their love must endure long separation and an evil lord's lust. Classic story and an interesting story-telling method make for a truly entertaining film.",
