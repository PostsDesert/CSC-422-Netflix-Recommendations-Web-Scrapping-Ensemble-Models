(At least on this site) so let me add my 2 cents worth (pence worth?)\n\nI rented Metrosexuality from my local gay bookstore along with California based soap, West Hollywood Stories. What can I say? Once again the Brits blow us away when it comes to telling good stories in an engaging way.\n\nMetrosexuality is wonderful. It takes an even less traditional stance than `Queer as Folk' but presents gay folks (and their friends and families) in a positive light. The characters are presented within a gay subculture but within that milieu they are so real and understandable that I can identify with them all, even those that are very different from anyone that I know. As a gay man in his 40's I expect to be able to empathize with a 40 something gay man with a son and an ex-lover who's dating an ex-paratrooper but I was amazed by how quickly I felt myself in empathy with a straight man nearing middle age who's missing his wife.\n\nThe actors are uncommonly good looking and there's a wide variety to suit all tastes. The dialogue is so witty that this `Yank' longed for subtitles so that I wouldn't miss anything. The music integrated into the episodes was great and the different closing montages for every episode were a hoot. I only hope that this series goes on and on and that I can somehow find the next set of episodes in the good ole USA.\n\nUnlike Queer as Folk, I don't see this one making it `across the pond' as the sensibility is more British and less easily translated, particularly in its equal treatment of blacks. More's the pity."
