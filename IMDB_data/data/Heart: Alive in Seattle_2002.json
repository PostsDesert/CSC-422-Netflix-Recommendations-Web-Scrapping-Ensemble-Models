        "reviewBody": "I was born a few years before Heart released their first album. I loved so many of their songs, seen them in concert many times and even wrote a Commodore 64 video game called Heart where you go through a large maze finding pieces of the lyrics to Hearts songs. LOL!\n\nI never published the video game, I was just a kid tinkering and coming up with ideas. I loved programming and I loved Heart so I called myself Heart Soft. LOL!\n\nI'm sure you know about Heart! As for this DVD... I'm not a fan of live recordings but Heart does pretty good here. My favorite song off the whole album is Love Alive.\n\nA beautiful song, very well done even for a live song.\n\nThe only cd I didn't really like over all these decades and all these songs was Jupiters Darling. While all the other cd's have been played thousands of times over the years I just couldn't enjoy Jupiters Darling.\n\nAnyways, I have played this DVD about 30 times. It's a nice flash back to 2003. Nice to see my favorite band. I have lots of pictures of heart too from concerts over the years in the GTA.",
