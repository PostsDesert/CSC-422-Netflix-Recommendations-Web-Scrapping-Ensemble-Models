        "reviewBody": "I've seen many action movies where the ladies rough it up. Unfortunately the action is either too short or too predictable. Sometimes its even ridiculous. I remember watching this movie where the female villian was bashing up all the male cops who tried to arrest her. The female cop came up behind her, gave her a punch & she was out cold. That sucked!\n\nTherefore I was glad that She Shoots Straight was nothing like that. In fact the final fight scene between the 2 ladies makes this movie the best action movie ever! I am particularly impressed with Agnes Aurelio. This babe not only has a great muscular body but is able to fight well too."
