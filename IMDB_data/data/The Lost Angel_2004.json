I would want to be the poor guy who payed ticket Not even the sex scene (which appeared out of nowhere) was not worthy of special attention\n\nDoes anybody know Carol O'Connell? She's a great new york writer. I've any of her books is transformed into movies. See it, it can only be amazing. And please mail me if u know anything"
