I love movies that try hard, yet make you wonder, \"What the hell were they thinking?\" We've seen some great ones: Rad, Midnight Madness, Escape from New York, Gymkata, Breakin'...\n\nFrom the title, Hot Wax Zombies on Wheels, I thought I'd really found a film with promise. Oh how horribly wrong I was! This movie is too bad to even laugh at, let alone with. It's obvious that they weren't even trying. I'm still not sure whether they were trying for horror spoof or just soft porn. Either way, they failed miserably. Even if you could tolerate the bad acting, inane dialogue, and incomprehensible plot, you still won't be able to handle the cartoon sound effects, flying fish in every other scene, and excruciatingly slow pace. Yes, it's even worse than Frankenhooker.\n\nI've never written a review here before, but I felt compelled to do so in the hope that I can prevent others from wasting their time and money on this mess.",
