It's a novel idea but the scripts are just bad and the attempts to make it funny at times makes it even worse.\n\nThe series shows the O' Connell family once again trying to defeat the evil mummy priest Imhotep(that looks very different from the movies, HE'S PURPLE).\n\nThe fact that you cannot believe that a couple and the female's brother are up against an evil force three times in their lives is just stupid and giving us this plot in bad form makes it worse.\n\nThis makes both movies look as if they were here to show how bad cartoons can be. The movies were great fun, but this is strictly for children who can't count to ten yet. Terrible stuff."
