        "reviewBody": "In what is probably his best role to date, with apologies to his turns as Ike Turner in the classic \"What's Love Got to Do With It\", and Morpheus in the \"Matrix\" series, Laurence Fishburne plays undercover cop Russell Stevens, who poses as drug dealer John Hull to apprehend a notorious drug kingpin. This role is played in a way that only he could, with the zeal that makes him one of Hollywood's most sought after actors. From the moment that he tells the D.E.A. agent that \"the n****** the one that would even answer that question\" you know that this role was made for him. Also Jeff Goldblum is at his best as a not-so-honest defense attorney. And let's not forget Gregory Sierra as a sadistic crime lord and one of the best character actors of our time, Clarence Williams III as an honest cop. Add the soundtrack and \"Deep Cover\" is a bona fide 10 in the urban drama genre, a true masterpiece.",
