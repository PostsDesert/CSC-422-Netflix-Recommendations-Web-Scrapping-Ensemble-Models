The DVD version is sparse, has only 2.0 audio, and no sub-titling (though it was easy enough to hear). The theme song by Sasha Lazard, \"Angeli\" was so beautiful that I got up before the credits had finished and purchased it on iTunes. I first saw this via Netflix but loved it so much I picked it up on Amazon for $10, and it will be watched as one of those we go back to at least once a year. \n\nThe two leading ladies were absolute knockouts. I'd recommend this to anyone with a heart.",
