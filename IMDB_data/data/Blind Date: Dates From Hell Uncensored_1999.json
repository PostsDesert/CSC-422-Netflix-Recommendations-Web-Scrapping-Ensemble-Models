My only complaint is that the box says \"uncensored,\" and even warns about nudity. Well, there's no nudity of any kind...the only thing that would be censored are the swear words. So you're paying to rent an episode of Blind Date just because they left in the swear words. Big whoop, huh? I expected...well, I don't know, but something more wild. Couldn't I have just watched this on TV for free?"
