Although not the comedy style fan-service that most associate the term with these days, this one's pretty serious. I actually liked it pretty well, even though it doesn't do much to stand out from the pack. Something about these older fantasy anime OVAs/series that I tend to really like. At least there's a heap of action--the entire last third of the film is a big ol' fight--but the animation is cheap and the visuals bland. Even the Japanese acting is bad. But I still loved it.\n\nA low-minded, nudity-strewn, fantasy action fest. worth the time for fans of heckling bad action movies.",
