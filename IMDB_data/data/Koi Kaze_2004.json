        "reviewBody": "Every review says this anime deals with incest in a mature way, which granted it does, but none of them deal with the fact that the girl is 15 and the guy is 27. If they were both adults of a similar age, it would be one thing, but the fact that not only is it incest, it's statutory rape as well makes this anime a lot less respectable. When you write a synopsis about this anime people, but upfront about it. Don't leave out the fact of the age differences between the characters and that the female lead isn't even an adult. That throws it into the category of perverted male loli fantasy about his sister rather then a mature dealing with a complicated issue.",
