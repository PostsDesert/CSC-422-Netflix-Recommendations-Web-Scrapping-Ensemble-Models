His bodyguard Tony Lau (Mark Dacascos) betrayals him with the American drug dealer Coolio, introducing drugs in his territory. Two young Chinese detectives and an undercover Japanese Interpol agent chases the `bad guys'. `China Strike Force' is a good action movie, with well choreographed action scenes. I do not know who perform these scenes (stunts or actors themselves), but I found this film a good entertainment. It works perfectly on video. Norika Fujiwara is really a very beautiful woman. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): `FÃºria em Shanghai' (`Rage in Shanghai')",
