Mick Ronson's guitaring almost steals the show. \n\nInteresting behind-the-scenes footage adds a new, more personal, aspect to the live concert genre. Could have done with more of that though, as the behind-the-scenes stuff is fleeting, and sometimes seems token. Maybe some footage of practices and sound checks, or interviews with Bowie, would have been in order. \n\nNot perfect though. Production quality is quite raw and rough. Sound quality is variable. \n\nA must-see for all David Bowie fans.",
