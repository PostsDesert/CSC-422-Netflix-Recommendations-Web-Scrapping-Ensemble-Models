I know several people who saw this movie, own no TMBG albums, and are now big fans.\n\nThis film repeatedly made an audience of a few hundred laugh and inspired me to dig out some of my old tapes. The interviews are far more insightful than the usual rockumentary and leave you feeling like you'd like to hang out with those guys.\n\nSome material is taken from a This American Life piece on the band. If you don't get a chance to see the film, at least listen to the 15 minute interview on ThisAmericanLife.org."
