There was a great deal of hatred in the killers face and a real dark dark side, along with a tortured deep mental problem. Barbara Niven,(Donna Germaine),\"The Drone Virus\",'04, put her heart and soul into this role and showed what a great talent she has to offer Hollywood. Donna gets her complete mind, body and soul into getting a SOUL MATE for life and will do anything that will accomplish her goal. Human life is taken left and right through out the picture and everything is a perfect crime to go along with the Title of the film, \" A Perfect Neighbor\". Enjoy.",
