Much to his surprise, he is given the job of coach of Team USA Hockey for the Junior Goodwill Games in California. With most of the Ducks and a few new players in tow, he sets forth for LA.\n\nWhen you have a sequel, you have to make it bigger and better. This film is possibly bigger, because now the kids are playing in some sort of Olympic-like setting against a team from Iceland. So the pressure is much greater. But is it better? Not really. It's rather flat with no plot development, character development or surprises.\n\nFans of the first film might like this, especially because it will allow them to just relax for 90 minutes and not have to invest themselves. It's a good movie to play in the background. Also, Leah Lail is in it.",
