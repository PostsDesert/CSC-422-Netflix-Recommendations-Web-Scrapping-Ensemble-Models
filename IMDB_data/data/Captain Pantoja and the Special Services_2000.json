        "reviewBody": "Now, having served 23 years in the military, I have never had the opportunity to have an assignment of this nature. Those damn officers get all the good jobs! I watched this because of Angie Cepeda (Love in the Time of Cholera), but was impressed with the performance of Salvador del Solar, who played the fortunate Captain who got this assignment.\n\nWatching him work out of his element, and try to keep his wife (Mónica Sánchez) happy while he was working with such incredible beauty as Cepeda, was a real thrill, and Solar was magnificent.\n\nThe movie was very funny, as you would expect, especially from those who thought the whole idea sacrilegious. Maybe it was, but it solved the problem.\n\nA funny, romantic movie that never fails to amuse and entertain as we wonder if the Captain will falls into the Colombiana's (Cepeda) snares and lose his wife, whether the investigative reporter Sinchi (Aristóteles Picho) will expose the whole sordid mess, whether the Colombiana and Pechuga (Tatiana Astengo), who also loves the Captain will get into a fight, and how will his service record be after all this. Will he get a medal? Ah, the questions that must be answered.",
