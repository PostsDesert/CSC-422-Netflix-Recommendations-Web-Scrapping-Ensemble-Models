        "reviewBody": "With its harsh subject matter, it always surprises me (even just a little) that \"War Stories\" follows so soon after \"Out of Gas\". But it's a phenomenal character piece, this time centering on the Mal-Zoe-Wash triangle. And I like that, no matter what goes down here, it's really about them. What's great is that Alan Tudyk gets his time to really shine outside of his usual one-liner confines. Wash totally mans right up when the chips are down and proves his mettle among his more battle-worn peers. The torture scenes in this episode are rough, but also deeply rewarding in the end.\n\n8/10 Also, we already know this, but Zoe's an incontrovertible badass.",
