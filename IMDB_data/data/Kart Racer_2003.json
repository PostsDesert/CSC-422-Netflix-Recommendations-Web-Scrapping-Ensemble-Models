Also, kids that age do not race with MaxSr engines.\n\nThe indoor lapping in the shop was a bit nuts.\n\nThe racing sounds were overdubbed with car engines or something, because I drive a rotax kart and I have never heard it sound like that. These are two-cycle engines, and I rarely heard the noises I associate with these engines during any of the racing/driving footage.\n\nAlso, these karts--RotaxMax--do not make 105mph top speed.",
