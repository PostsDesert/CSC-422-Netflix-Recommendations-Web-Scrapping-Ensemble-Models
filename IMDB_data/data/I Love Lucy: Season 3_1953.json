        "reviewBody": "Due to the popularity of I Love Lucy this movie was planned. It consists of three episodes from the series first season. It opens with Desi welcoming the audience giving us an idea of what it might be like to be at a live broadcast. It then goes into the first episode. The remaining two are strung together with some new footage to try and create one cohesive story.\n\nHowever, this endeavor never saw a theatrical release. At the time Lucy and Desi were promoting their film, The Long, Long Trailer for MGM. This film was being promoted as their return to the big screen. MGM demanded that the I Love Lucy movie be shelved so as not to contradict this claim and as the Arnazes were under contract to MGM they had to comply. As the story goes the film was forgotten and then \"lost\" for many years.\n\nThis is definitely one of those rare nuggets for the true I Love Lucy fan who has seen it all.",
