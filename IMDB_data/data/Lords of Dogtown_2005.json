        "reviewBody": "When I first heard this film was being made, I was very excited because, despite being about 10 years too late, grew up inspired by the Z-Boys through the writings and photographs of C.R. Stecyk and Glen E. Friedman. Adams, Alva and Peralta are the three most important skateboarders ever. Heck... I have a Jay Adams tattoo portrait.\n\nThen I had second thoughts fearing the Hollywood-ization of their story. I thought the drama of their tough lives in Venice would likely be glamorized and exploited with much of the truth unbelievably stretched. But I wasn't their to witness it, so I asked someone who was part of the Dogtown skate scene and friends with those the film is about, and he said that is exactly what the movie.\n\nHe also told me that if you're familiar with the true story or have even just seen the documentary (Dogtown & the Z-Boys), then the movie will just come off corny. But if you go into not expecting an intelligent film and just a fun movie, you may get just that. So I saw it today think it would be just that, and it was.\n\nThe skate scenes were all right, but excited me by striking up thoughts of the truth of it all. The aggressiveness of Ledger's portrayal of Skip Enblom seemed cheesy and over the top. The kids who played Peralta and Alva weren't terrible, too, but Emile Hirsch did a good job as Jay Adams. And I'm confused at who this Chino guy is. I'm guessing it's supposed to be Zephyr shop owner Jeff Ho who wouldn't have anything to do with the film.\n\nIt was funny to see cameos by Alva, Adams, Peralta, Skip and Bob Biniak. Tony Hawk's cameo was uncalled for. But overall, the film was enjoyable, especially by all everyone else in the theater, considering I was the only one above the age of 17 it seemed. And it's great to see the legend of these guys be spread to new generations, especially with skateboarding as popular than ever. I think all new skaters should recognize their roots.\n\nI just hope people will make the effort to at least see the documentary and hopefully pick up Stecyk and Friedman's \"Dogtown - The Legend of the Z-Boys\" book and read all the original Skateboarder magazine stories and images. That can't be beat.",
