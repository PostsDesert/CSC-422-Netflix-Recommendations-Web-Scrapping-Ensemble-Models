Films like this are as close as we may ever come to traveling in time. Welles' inimitable self is revealed here as nowhere else as he travels about Europe, meeting, greeting and interviewing. A rich \"cast of characters,\" the real people encountered on the journey, make for a remarkable study. At times, not only is the influence of the recent war apparent, but also the ominous sense of life at the \"dawn of the nuclear age.\" It's a shame only that there aren't more episodes. Long live Orson Welles!"
