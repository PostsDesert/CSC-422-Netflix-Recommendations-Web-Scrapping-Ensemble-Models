On the second watch I couldn't finish the film.\n\nActors did their best with what they had but I really can't recommend watching this. It attempted to make you guess the storyline with some very weak relationship build ups, but all it did was let me down.\n\nIt has a cheap low budget feel to it and I really do think Netflix were relying on the big budget actors to make this film.\n\nIt's a shame because with the line up it should have been a really good evening film for couples, but I wouldn't watch this again if you paid me.",
