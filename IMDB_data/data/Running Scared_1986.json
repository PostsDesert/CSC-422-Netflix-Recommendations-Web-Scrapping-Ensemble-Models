Followed by \"Tango & Cash\", \"Last Boy Scout\", and \"Showdown In Little Tokyo\". \"Running Scared\" seems to be a forgotten 80's classic. Not many people mention it when discussing great buddy-cop films. But they should.\n\nThe chemistry between Crystal and Hines is magical. Both actors bring a lot to the table and their comic timing is perfect. They make a great duo and it's a shame a sequel never followed. This film is ripe for rediscovery. Some great actors pop up in supporting roles as well. If you dig any of the buddy-cop movies that followed it, watch this film. Good action, good laughs, great movie."
