His parents, the Donners, try to hide his glowing nose but during the Reindeer Games, his fake nose falls off. He is ridiculed and kicked out of the games. Meanwhile, an elf named Hermey would rather be a dentist than making toys. He runs away and meets Rudolph. They join up with prospector Yukon Cornelius who is looking for gold and silver. They escape the Abominable Snow Monster and discover the Island of Misfit Toys.\n\nThis is a classic with two of the best Christmas songs ever; \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" and \"A Holly Jolly Christmas\". The stop-motion animation has an old fashion charm. It also brings to the world the Island of Misfit Toys. The only minor complaint is that Santa needs to be more jolly. He's a little judgmental on Rudolph's nose early on. It's a small point in what is an imaginative icon.",
