        "reviewBody": "As a fan of Elton John's for many years, I found this to be great entertainment all round. Not only the music but the show as well. Over time Elton has been renowned for his extravagances on stage and he has certainly proven that in this DVD but it is not excessively overdone. The show is very well balanced from a guest artist point of view and he allows his guests to hold the stage to ensure he does not overshadow them whilst they are on. The musical content is brilliant and reproduces well on 5.1 surround sound. My only criticism would be Elton's own voice of his early songs have lost some of the high pitch as is the case in Tiny Dancer. Still it is a fantastic show and I would still pay to see him live. For mine 9 out of 10.",
