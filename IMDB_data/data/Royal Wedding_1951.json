Powell goes after royalty in the form of Peter Lawford and Astaire sets his eyes on Sarah Churchill. Which will win out in the end, their old dance routine or their new romantic interests? Pure Hollywood fluff here, but enjoyable for the time period nonetheless. One of the more under-rated musicals of the early-1950s. Astaire, getting up in years here, still shows amazing athleticism through the dance sequences. Not a bad time passer. 4 stars out of 5."
