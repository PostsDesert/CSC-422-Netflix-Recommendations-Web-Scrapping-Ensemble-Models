I usually watch the first few minutes of Letterman or Leno, but this is one talk show that I watch to the zany end.\n\nAll talk shows have some boring guests, but this will definitely not be tolerated on Dame Edna's show! At the touch of a button, Dame Edna removes any tiresome talker. He or she may fall through a trap door or be removed with an ejection seat. I hope Dave and Jay are listening!\n\nThe sets are lovely, except for the private elevator which has trapped several super stars. Dame Edna, as always, is beautifully dressed. My favorite gown is adorned with a large animated stuffed lizard which on command can stick out it's lovely forked tongue. Don't miss this wonderful experience!"
