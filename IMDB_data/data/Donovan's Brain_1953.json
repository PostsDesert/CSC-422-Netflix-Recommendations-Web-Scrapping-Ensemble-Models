With the deceased man's mob connections, life is soon troublesome for the brilliant doc.\n\nStarring Nancy Davis (the future Nancy Reagan) and written by Curt Siodmak, who had written many sci-fi and horror films (most notably \"The Wolf Man\")... this came from his original novel of the same name.\n\nAlthough not the original film version of this story (that would be \"The Lady and the Monster\" in 1944) it went on to influence a great many other films and television shows, from \"Star Trek\" to Stephen King's \"It\". (The \"Star Trek\" influence is on the episode \"Spock's Brain\", though it should be noted that a character in this film does say, \"I'm a doctor, not an electrician.\" Bones?)",
