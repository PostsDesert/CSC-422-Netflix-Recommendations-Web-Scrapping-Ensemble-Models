Back when this movie was made, it was when Chris Tucker was at his absolute best, before he became the serious artist he's tried to become today. This I want to be taken seriously disease seems to plague lots of comedians when they start to achieve some sort of box office success. Eddie Murphy. Is one that immediately comes to mind. So sit back and enjoy the days when a comedian at his prime does what he does best; entertain you and make you laugh.",
