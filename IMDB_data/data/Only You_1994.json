The story is developed nicely and gives us some lessons about love and life and things in between.\n\nThe actors, especially Marisa Tomei, do a great job in telling us this beautiful story. The finale is exceptional: I will always hope for this kind of support when I am at an Italian airport...\n\nWatch this movie when you are in a romantic mood and want to see a film which believes in true love. Or watch it to get into a romantic mood. And enjoy the various plot twists...",
