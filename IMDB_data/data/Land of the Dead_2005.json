A revolution is brewing in a plan to overthrow the city. but outside the walls the zombies are developing their intelligence.\n\nThe plot kind of sounds a bit lame, but it really does work well and this is a zombie flick that can be taken quite seriously. Romero has again created something great on a tight budget, and he has done well to make it look good, with some great make up effects. The cast are all pretty good, there are some good characters and the dialogue is effective.\n\nOverall Land of the Dead delivers all out zombie action that's great for fans of the genre, good work George.\n\n8/10",
