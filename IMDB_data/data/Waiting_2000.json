        "reviewBody": "This is not Oscar material by far, but it definitely has its charm if you like dark comedy mixed with satire. I have to admit, the first few minutes are totally dead and almost had me ready to turn off the set and send this back, but then after the first bit of humor emerged in the script, (and because there were no other movies in the house--LOL) I decided to give it a chance. All things being said, I'm glad I gave it the chance. I share the view of one previous reviewer, in that I liked this movie more than I thought I would. You'll notice immediately that the acting is not the greatest, which actually adds to the film's satire quotient by making it seem more like a slice of real life (kind of has that Michael Moore documentary feel to it). I honestly have to say that some of the situations were hysterically funny and had me rolling out of the chair. Schtick at its best. Also, the appearance of Ron Jeremy (...yes, THE Ron Jeremy of porn movie fame) in the film (and as the father of a precocious little boy, no doubt) adds greatly to the satire aspect as well. Check out the \"Outtakes\" portion of Bonus Selections. The outtake of Little Boy Lunch was the funniest! I think they should have used the alternate beginning as well. All in all, I was not disappointed. Thumbs up!",
