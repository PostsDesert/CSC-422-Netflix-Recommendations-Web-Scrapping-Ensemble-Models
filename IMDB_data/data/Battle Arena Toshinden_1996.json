        "reviewBody": "When this movie came on the Action Channel. I never got to see it. I have been waiting for it to come back, but it never did. It wasn't very long until I bought the movie on DVD. I learned that this movie was the very first DVD that Central Park Media aka(U.S. Manga Corps) first released. It was really cool when I watched the entire movie,it was just like the video game with all the cool characters. My favorite characters in the movie are: Eiji,Sofia,Ellis,Fo,and Duke. The movie also features the voices of: Hideo Seaver,Ted Lewis and Lisa Ortiz famous for Yu-Gi-Oh!, Chris Yates,Greg Wolfe, Carter Cathcart famous for Grappler Baki, Alfred Debutler, Billy Regan, Apollo Smile, Teri Muus, Emma Rayda, and Debbie Rabbai. I think this is the best anime to see. So in closing to this review. Add it to your collection if you don't have it. You will see what I mean.",
