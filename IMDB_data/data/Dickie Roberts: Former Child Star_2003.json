Spade is terrific, the 'child star' has beens are wonderful and likable in spoofing their own careers. You've got to respect that.\n\nMary McCormack is both beautiful and very funny in the 'straight role' of the movie. I'd love to see her do more comedy. Did I mention that she is very easy on the eyes? The dude who plays her husband and Dickie's 'father' is hilarious too. His name escapes me. Not many lines, but stole scenes. A confident Spade seemed to let him do that, the sign of a good comedic actor is that HE doesn't have to get all the good lines.\n\nThe kids are endearing. The 'stunts' (ie bike crashes) are phenomenal.\n\nLike Tommy Boy and Joe Dirt, he plays that goofy guy who's missing it on most cylinders, but you can't help rooting for.\n\nThat's a guy I want in any comedy I see. The underachieving underdog who figures it out in the end and makes good. Spade is terrific at playing that role - and in Dickie Roberts - he's at his best.",
