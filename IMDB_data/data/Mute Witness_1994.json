        "reviewBody": "This is a very good surprise,this horror low budget movie.The influences are definitely European,and Dario Argento's fans should relish with that:the cinematography and the direction recall such works as \"suspiria\" and \"l'ucello della piume de cristallo\" with a simpler script and less showing off.The mute heroine will make old cinema buffs think of Dorothy MCGuire's part in \"the spiral staircase\"(Robert Siodmak,1946),but this latter movie was hitchcockian to the core whereas this one ,I say it again,is more \"argentoesque\":the scene in which the baddie tries to force open the frightened girl flat was in the two mentioned movies.The comic relief (the people above who cannot sleep because of the \"noise\" ) might be an allusion to HG Clouzot's \"les diaboliques\".\n\nThis is an action-packed story,using the settings with intelligence and dexterity.And very honest,at that:Russians speak Russian and thus are credible.This adds to the suspense because there are actually three languages:Russian ,English,and the heroine's one who can only communicate by looks and gestures.To top it all,there's a superb cameo for sir Alec Guiness -the only star of the movie,at least in western Europe and America-,who appears billed as \"mystery guest star\" in the credits.All psychological suspense afficionados must see this overlooked gem."
