        "reviewBody": "After the utter bust that was New Beginning the franchise finds its feet again and brings Jason Voorhees back from the dead starting a new chapter in his iconic rise to stardom.\n\nTommy Jarvis returns this time played by Thom Mathews (Who I can't take seriously after Return Of The Living Dead 1 & 2). Sadly it in no way explains his actions at the end of the last film, you'd think that'd be the first thing they'd address.\n\nIn a weird opening sequence Jason is resurrected and you guessed it, goes on a killing spree. Returning to Camp Crystal Lake Tommy seeks to end Jason once and for all! A blend of the early movies and the messy last chapter this is certainly a return to form even if it is nothing special.\n\nWith a dodgy opening sequence and daft closing scene the film is badly flawed but gets by with it's vintage Jason style killing action.\n\nThe Good: \n\nSome interesting kills \n\nUndead Jason > Living Jason \n\nThe Bad:\n\nWeirdly comedic in places\n\nDoesn't explain what happened since the last film \n\nRidiculous opening\n\nNot that well made in places \n\nAll this recasting for the lead is very damaging \n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie: \n\nThe groundskeeper is a farthead",
