It's animation is beautiful, but low points in animation will stand out a lot. Its characters are good (except Artemis and Moon. Both are exceedingly annoying).\n\nThe great parts:\n\nTheme song is a banger\n\n(Most of) the animation is amazing\n\nThe overall plot is very good.\n\nPeople say that this show is for kids and they rated it poorly as it is a children's show. It has cringy jokes, but like said before, it's made for kids. If you didn't like the show for the jokes, then it's like hating a kids cartoon because it wasn't adult enough.",
