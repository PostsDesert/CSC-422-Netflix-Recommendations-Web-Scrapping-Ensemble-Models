This documentary is extremely well done, great music (of course) with fascinating insights about the life of Mozart. (At least for someone not too familiar with the details).\n\nAlas I missed the beginning - I tuned into the rebroadcast - and unfortunately the recording was garbled, and the screen went blank often.\n\nI so very much want to see this in its entirety I am praying it will be rebroadcast soon!",
