It would be one of the weaker efforts I have seen this year, and I suppose my main criticism would be the quality of the acting. Apart from the two female leads, a lot of the other acting was not as good as it should have been, and especially a number of the supporting cast were quite wooden at times. Dhani's grandma was quite hammy at times, as were some of Rishab's work colleagues, and even Rishab himself was not as well played as I have seen Salman Khan before, in \"Mujhse Shaadi Karogi\" for example. Some of his tearful bedside scenes were just a little hard to watch, not because of the pathos but because it wasn't believable. I did enjoy moments of the film, and the dance sequence in the nightclub was very hot, but on the whole I have seen better.",
