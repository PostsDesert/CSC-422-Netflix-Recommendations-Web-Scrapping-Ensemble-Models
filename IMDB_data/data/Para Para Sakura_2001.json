        "reviewBody": "The story goes like this: Aaron plays the role of a color-blind dance teacher who gradually sees and \"feels\" the color of the world after meeting and feeling in love with Cecilia, who, however, is engaged. The question is, would they be together in the end?\n\nCecilia, the \"It\" girl of HK films, is practically in every movie these days. At first I didn't like her but she grows on you. Not only is she beautiful, she seems like a very sweet girl. This movie has some great musical numbers and Aaron really gets to show off his dancing prowess. He can even do breakdancing, very well, I might add.\n\nAnother great thing about this movie is that it takes place in Shanghai and it really gets to show off the city. I went there 5 years ago and now it is completely different. Shanghai has really progressed and become a modern city.\n\nOverall, Para Para Sakura is an enjoyable movie.",
