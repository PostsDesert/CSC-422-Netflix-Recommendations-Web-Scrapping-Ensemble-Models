        "reviewBody": "As Jerry Lewis was winding down in his career as a box office star he did this film in Great Britain where he got to co-star with Terry-Thomas. Lewis plays a mercurial entrepreneur of sorts whose schemes seem to go awry all the time. For one thing unabashed con man Terry-Thomas is constantly bamboozling him. But when wife Jacqueline Pearce finally is ready to leave him once and for all, Lewis has need of his nemesis and the contacts he has to win her back.\n\nHe'll have to go some because after he turns their home into what he thinks is a grand idea, a combination discotheque and Chinese Restaurant in swinging London of the Sixties that settles his hash. But Lewis has a scheme whereby he steals the plans for a new type oil driller from Pearce's boyfriend Nicholas Parsons and he needs Terry-Thomas to make the contacts for illegal buyers.\n\nDon't Raise The Bridge Lower The River had a pretty good plot premise, but somehow Lewis and Terry-Thomas never quite meshed together in their comedy styles. It's like both were in different films. In fact the comedy itself is clearly British in origin with Lewis brought in to insure some American box office.\n\nOne good thing about the film is the debut of Patricia Routledge as the mentor of some Girl Guides which is the British equivalent of the Girl Scouts. When she gets loaded and sets a romantic eye on Jerry it gets the funniest it does get.",
