        "reviewBody": "There's alot to like in The Attic Expeditions. It's a stylish low-budget film done with alot of care. It's very involving and does hold your attention. Having said that I wish that the script could have had at least a tighter handle of some of it's components. I really enjoy films that are abstract and you have to figure out (Mullholland Drive being a terrific example of this genre)but when not one single aspect is grounded it just leaves you completely confused with not much to help you solve the puzzle (or at least come to your own conclusion). The acting for the most part in this film is also a problem. With the exception of the always likeable Seth Green, the rest of the cast is extremely weak especially Andras Jones as Trevor. His acting is so wooden and unconvincing to the point of distraction and this is a major problem considering he plays the main character. The rest of the cast doesn't fare that much better, either they are utterly stiff or overtly overacting. Still, even with these problems the film holds your interest throughout and it's technically quite strong. The film must also be commended for going it's own original way instead of being another schloky rip-off of teen slasher flicks. A mixed bag but worth a look for genre fans."
