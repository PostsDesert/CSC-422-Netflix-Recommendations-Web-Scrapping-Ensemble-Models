I decided to watch it see what it was like, as I have heard about these thumb films, but I've never actually seen one, so I wanted to check it out. Good God, I will never watch a thumb film as long as I live. The (over)acting was terrible. I know it was technically a cartoon but come on, that's the worse excuse ever. The characters were so boring, cardboard characters have more depth. The film looked horrible. The sets were alright, but the thumbs just bobbed up and down and slide to where they needed to be. The worse part was that this was trying to spoof Frankenstein, a classic, and failed miserably. None of the jokes were remotely funny. By all means, avoid this piece of crud at all costs. Find the original Frankenstein and enjoy it. If you did see this film (the thumb one), use Frankenstein to wash this filth out of your system.",
