It's amazing what a little nudity and gore will do to improve an otherwise unoriginal slasher flick, but it looks like the producers had enough sense to go for the lowest common denominator on this one with the result of a watchable, albeit generic, slasher flick. Nothing to rave about and the ending is totally stupid, but it delivers the goods for what movies like this are intended for.",
