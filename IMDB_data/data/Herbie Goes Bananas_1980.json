That's not Panamá city, that's Guadalajara, Jalisco's downtown (they even have a scene in the Arcos Vallarta monument).\n\nAlso, when the lancheros rescue Herbie out of the ocean, not only do they speak and look as mexicans, but the music they put is the typical spaniard-mex they love to portray all Latinoamérica with...\n\nOtherwise, this is the worst Herbie movie, and that says a lot."
