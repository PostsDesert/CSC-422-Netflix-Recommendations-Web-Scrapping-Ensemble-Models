The shark looked very real...even moreso than the one in the \"Jaws\" movies. Granted, there was a substantial amount of blood and gore, but it was a horror movie so that's to be expected. There still wasn't as much of that in \"Red Water\" as there was in \"Jaws\" (any of them). OK, that's all of my \"review\"...Now I have to ramble to make up the 10 line minimum...lol! As I said before, NOTHING Mr. Phillips does (in my opinion) is bad or something I wouldn't want to watch again, so maybe I'm not really the right person to review any of his movies...lol!"
