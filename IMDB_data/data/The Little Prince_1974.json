You wouldn't criticize \"Don't Look Now\" because Donald Sutherland wears wide lapels.\n\n\"The Little Prince\" is a pitch-perfect film, beautifully written and filmed, with an amazing sense of humor. Yes, it's totally dated, and some of the songs are horrible, but it's got an originality even \"West Side Story,\" another classic stylish film, can't match.\n\nIf you want irony, American humor or 21st century attitude, avoid this film like the plague. But if you can appreciate brilliant little films that wear their hearts on their sleeves don't miss this film.\n\nAn added bonus: in Bob Fosse's spectacular five minute dance you can see every dance move Michael Jackson ever made."
