Sure, it's loaded with profanity and swears, but you tend to drown out these facts because you're roaring with laughter. He has a gift for entertaining his audience by drawing them into his comedy structure in a very natural way. Every punch line was so hilarious. The moment I turned it on, I couldn't turn it off. It was inevitable that this young talent would flourish into the Academy Award winner he is today. I say bravo Jamie! If you're reading this and you plan to watch this show, get ready for a roller-coaster ride of straight comedy. Jamie Foxx is a hoot! Impressive...",
