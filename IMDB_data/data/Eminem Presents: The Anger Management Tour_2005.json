        "reviewBody": "Unlike other Eminem DVD's, this one contain a full Live Concert filmed in Detroit. The concert was filmed in 2002. So there is no 8 Mile, D12 World or Encore related songs performed on this DVD. But you get classics like Forgot About Dre, The Way I Am, Cleanin Out My Closet, Just Don't Give A ***, Without Me, Purple P**** etc...\n\nProof is set as the back-up rapper for Eminem. But also Obie Trice, Dina Rae and the rest of D12 is featured on this concert. Besides this the DVD contains a \"Behind The Scenes Look The Tour\" that is about 15 minutes long and a uncut version of the music video Ass Like That.\n\nI give this DVD 9. I really like the concert, but i missed these songs: The Real Slim Shady, Role Model and Till I Collapse. If you like to watch live concerts on DVD and you like hip-hop, you should buy this! If you like backstage footage, you should buy the previous DVD's from Eminem.",
