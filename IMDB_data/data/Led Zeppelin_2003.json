I recommend anyone to watch their DVD 'the song remains the same' it contains many of their famous tracks but performed in a different way. The DVD has me trance every time i watch it, it truly contains ultimate magic and power. No matter how bad a mood I'm in as soon as i hear zep I'm quickly put back on top of the world. They are an inspiration to everyone. They know things about the world we don't. Robert Plants voice is an instrument in itself, any noise he made would sound amazing. Their music is about feeling not the lyrics. My favourite tracks are... Over the hills and far away, dazed and confused, since I've been loving you and whole lotta love. I guess i would say I'm an ultimate life long fan!!"
