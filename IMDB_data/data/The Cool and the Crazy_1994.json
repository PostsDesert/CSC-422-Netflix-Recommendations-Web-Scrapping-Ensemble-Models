        "reviewBody": "This anime series is centred on Himuro. Outwardly he is an ordinary office worker but in fact he is a supernatural being who causes the temperature to drop and snow to fall whenever he experiences strong emotions. This could be a real problem when he starts to fall for co-worker Fuyutsuki however the story takes place in a reality were there are people descended from various spirits so his co-workers easily accept that he is descended from a 'snow woman'. Over the course of the series their friendship develops. We also get to know their various co-workers.\n\nThis is a rather enjoyable Josei series. The story is told at a gentle pace without needed excessive drama or fan service. The basic concept is fun and Himuro's snow creation is a way of showing his emotion rather than anything like a superpower. The characters are likeable and relatable. Overall I'd say this was an enjoyable romance with a supernatural twist; I'd recommend it, just don't expect action or melodrama.\n\nThese comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",
