        "reviewBody": "Why are there people trying to philosophize this movie? Talking about it like it's a real science fiction movie. The dialogue is terrible, the acting is terrible, the f/x are terrible, the story is almost nonexistent. But why go searching for those elements in a softcore porn flick? Because that's what this movie is! When you have beautiful naked women in virtually every scene, do we need much more? If this were a mainstream film, like \"Showgirls,\" I would be concerned if the nudity outweighed all the other elements. But this is a direct-to-video sci-fi porno meant to give pleasure to the male gender--and the females too, if they swing that way. So why is there a user rating of 3.3? Are there feminists commenting on this movie? \n\n The film stars Amber Newman and Taimie Hannum, two of the hottest women of Surrender Cinema. And I liked the blonde one, too. She's also really hot. There are many steamy sex scenes, some straight, some women-on-women, that definitely make this movie worth the rental price.\n\nIf you're looking for a film with substance and a story--you're in the wrong section of the video store. At least it's supposed to be put in the adult section. Some video stores put this movie in the sci-fi section. \n\n My score: 8 (out of 10)",
