(Although calling it a \"movie\" isn't really correct...it's a documentary)\n\nIt follows around Social Distortion and Youth Brigade on tour..basically. That's the best way to put it. And at times it cuts off and shows us these kids who go to punk rock shows, and live in the street, all that stuff...that stuff gets sort of boring, but everything with the bands is funny or just good to watch.\n\nOh yeah, and we see some of Minor Threat in this movie, when they stay at their place...\n\nJust check it out."
