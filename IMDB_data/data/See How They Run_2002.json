Having real life characters add something to the film as well.\n\nI laughed a lot during the film with some of the characters and some of the jokes being very well done.\n\nIts a reminder that there can be a great film made without the need for huge amounts of cgi, huge budgets and massive casts. This is just well written, well portrayed and with brilliant camera work, and just works really well.",
