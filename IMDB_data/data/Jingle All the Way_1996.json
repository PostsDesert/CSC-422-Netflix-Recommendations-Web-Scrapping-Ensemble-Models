A great script with loads of laughter.\n\nIt's obviously created as a spoof for the Christmas buying crazes that go on in the world, where everybody must have that one very special toy.\n\nIt has the look and feel of a children's movie - but I'm not sure it is, or was ever designed to be.\n\nDon't expect a Schwarzie action movie. It's more a live-action cartoon.\n\nJingle all the way is a movie I've seen a couple of times now - and I'll watch it again and again. Good fun. 8/10.",
