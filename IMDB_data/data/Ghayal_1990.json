        "reviewBody": "This movie gave Sunny Deol his first award, until then he was a struggling actor. I watched this movie when I was very young. It impressed me then it still impresses me to this day. Out of all the performances it was Sunny Deol's performance as the angry young man that stood out. Amrish Puri went through the motions, Raj Babbar was good and Meenakshi provided good support.\n\nSunny Deol career has gone downhill since his Ghayal days. The last impressive film he made was Border over a decade ago. These days he restricts himself to patriotic films which get him nowhere. This movie was directed by Rajkumar Santoshi, who went on to make great films like Damini and the highly underrated China- Gate. Coincidentally Raj Kanwar's name is mentioned as a assistant director, he went on to make Dewaana, Laadla, Judaai, Daag and many more. This was Sunny Deol in his finest hour.",
