After watching this movie the first time I was hooked on both Tyler Perry and Madea. For me personally this movie helped me through a hard time and turned me into a born again Christian.\n\nI agree with the previous comment about the beginning of the play. Each member of the cast's life is effected by Jesus in a powerful way. It does turn into a happy story for everyone and show's the power of God and the good he does.",
