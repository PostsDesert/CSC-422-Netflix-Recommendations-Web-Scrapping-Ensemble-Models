        "reviewBody": "An excellent made-for-TV documentary that features some interviews and insights from Sigourney Weaver, James Cameron, and others, as well as archive interviews with Ridley Scott. It's explained where the idea came from, takes you through the creature design, gives you insight into the filmmakers' artistic visions, and explains what was supposed to be happening when the film itself is ambiguous. And it does the same for the sequels.\n\nI highly recommend this, regardless of whether you're a fan of the series, you don't understand why they're so highly esteemed, or somewhere in between.",
