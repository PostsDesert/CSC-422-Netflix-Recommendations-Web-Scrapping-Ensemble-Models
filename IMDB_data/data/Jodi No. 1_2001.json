        "reviewBody": "Jodi No.1 is entertaining all the wayyyyyyyyyyy.\n\nGovinda as Veeru is simply excellent. His voice, expression, comic timing is really good.\n\nSanjay Dutt doesn't lag far behind his co-star. Just like the Jai of Sholay, his character is also serious with comedic touch to it. He has more comedy scenes than in HMJ, and performs well in them. What's surprising about Dutt is that he matches Govinda step by step in all the songs. Unlike HMJ, in Jodi No.1 Dutt manages to hold on his own. Dutt got a much better deal than in HMJ. I think the role should keeps his fans like me happy.\n\n Twinkle and Monica Bedi doesn't have much scope to perform, except look sexy and glamorous. I wasn't too keen on first when I heard Monica was cast opposite Dutt, but she wasn't that bad. She looks very pretty if she gets some good roles, she might make it in Bollywood. Pooja Batra does well in her cameo song.\n\nAnupam Kher, Ashish Vidhiyarti, Mukesh Rishi, Siyaji Shinde, Shakti Kapoor, Sanjay Narveraker (Dedh Phutia of Vaastav) lend good support.\n\n Don't expect a superb story in a DD film. Entertainment wise I give the Jodi No.1 a 8.5 out of 10.",
