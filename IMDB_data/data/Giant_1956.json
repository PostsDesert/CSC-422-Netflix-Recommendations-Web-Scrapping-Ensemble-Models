I've seen it at least 6 times in the last thirty years, and enjoy it more each time. I was pleased to see that it at least made the top 100 films of all time list, I believe it was the National Board of Review; If not, it was as prestigious an organization.\n\nGreat characterizations abound! Never has a films with such youthful leads, generated so much emotional impact. Even though George Stevens deservedly won for Best Director, the film should have garnered more Oscars, it was nominated in 11 or 12 categories. It definitely superior in every way to Mike Todd's \"Around the World in 80 Days\", even though that was a delightful movie, but clearly without the substance of \"Giant\". \n\n I always dreamed that subsequent generations would discover this movie and lift it to the blockbuster status that it deserves. I encourage anyone to see this movie, it has held up flawlessly over the years. A honest to goodness fabulous movie!",
