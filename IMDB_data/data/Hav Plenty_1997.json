Instead, I rented the video and I was so happy I didn't waste my money. Don't get me wrong, I give Mr. Cherot his props as a first time director, actor, editor and writer. I just thought the movie needed more character development and more of a plot. Maybe if this movie had been released before Lovejones, I wouldn't have had high expectations."
