        "reviewBody": "G-Men from Hell looks cheap and ugly because it is. But worse than that, it is simply an uninteresting mess of zany characters with no dimensions to make the viewer care about anything. The famous Coppola's untalented nephew Christopher uses a lot of Dutch angles because I guess he had no other ideas to make shots look interesting. Unfortunately this plan doesn't much help matters, but at least you can theoretically build a drinking game around it.\n\nThe film apparently attempts at being a comedy, but lacks any wit or charm. A lot of crazy things happen, but none of it is compelling. Decent actors such as Robert Goulet are thoroughly wasted here.\n\nSimply put, this is one of the worst films I have ever seen with no redeeming qualities to consider. Avoid.",
