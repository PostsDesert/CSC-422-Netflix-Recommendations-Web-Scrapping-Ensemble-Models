Even the Discovery Channel is not above producing a bit of \"tabloid TV\" when there's a chance of a profit.\n\nDr Zahi Hawass, secretary general of Egyptian Antiquities strongly advised Dr. Joann Fletcher against risking her reputation by participating in this program. She went ahead anyway. Later DNA testing on the mummy that Fletcher declared to be Nefertiti proved that it was the body of a MALE ! As a result of this and other incidents, she is no longer allowed to work in the Valley of The Kings, and may never recover her professional reputation."
