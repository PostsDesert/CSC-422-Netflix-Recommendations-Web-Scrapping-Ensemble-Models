        "reviewBody": "Its the First time ever in My Life that I have watched a Filipino Movie As A Huge Movie Fan I watch a lots of Movies from all over the World From Americans to British to Pakistanis as well as Indians/ All in all from Hollywood to Bollywood. But why I start watching this Movie Is the Simple Reason that I needed A Change and I Thank God I had this Movie Its So My Kind of So My Type of Movie. Romance + Drama + Comedy = And I Love You So (2009) It's Extremely Sweet, Well Written Movie, Great Acted & Wonderful Directed Movie,It's About Love which is extremely Rare to find in this kind of world in today's date. When It's 2010 well anyways It's such a wonderful Movie. I got to learn that Filipino Cinema is doing Excellent Job. They are Making their Movies in English Language which is so cool. Getting Back to The Movie And I Love You So (2009)\n\nBea Alonzo / Lara Cruz: She is so sweet looking wonderful Girl, The Movie revolves around her. She is indeed in so much pain which she doesn't deserve as her Character is so love-able. She is so Talented Actress.She did A Great Job.She does Look like Sonal Sehgal An Indian Television & Movie Actress.\n\nSam Milby / Chris Panlilio: He is so Hot. No Doubt About it for sure. I Loved the way he handled his Character in the Movie. He does Take A U-Turn in the First when he was Married he's looks were Kind of A Regular Office Guy But after the Betrayal from his Wife, he becomes DJ & A Type of Guy whom is so much is to so many Girls, But still, He's Good & Kind by heart. Oh! And not forgetting to mentioning that He Does Looks Like Bollywood Actor Emraan Hashmi & Oh! Yeah \"Enrique Iglesias\" \n\nDerek Ramsay as Oliver Cruz Oh! He Looks like Kelly Dorjee But Derek is Much More Hotter Then Dorjee He did An Excellent Job in the Movie. I Loved his Roll as he always there whenever Bea Alonzo / Lara Cruz needs him Short Lived But Always comes back. He's A Like-able Character. \n\nMr. Laurenti M. Dyog The Captain of the Movie/Ship Did A Great Job by picking the cool story line and Choosing these all Great Actors whom all Justify with the Movie. \n\nMy Favorite Scenes are as follows (1) The Car Parking \"Bea / Lara\" Scene. (2) The Bathroom Scene of Sam Milby / Chris Panlilio When \"Bea / Lara\" comes back for her Cell Phone & he hides it. (3) Sam Milby / Chris Panlilio & Bea / Lara's Car Scence (4) Cinema Scene. (5) Song Scene where Sam Milby / Chris Panlilio sings And I Love You So (6) The Great I have never seen An Ending Like this It was the Best Ending Ever \n\nMy Favorite Evergreen Line from the Movie is She sell sea shells by the sea shore ;) Its so cool",
