        "reviewBody": "I have seen this film maybe, 20 times over the last 30 years. It's one of the rare movies that entertains each and every time. Seeing movies like Flight Of The Phoenix only reminds me just how bad \"Hollywood\" has gotten.\n\nThe plot. It is quite simple really. Survival. But how the writers, producers and directors mold the basic premise into a complex and compelling 2 hours of cinema is a delight. \n\nTo watch Stewart, Finch, Attenborough, Kruger and company work in this movie is to see the difference between actors of yesteryear and movie stars of today.\n\nI am watching the movie as I type this and I'm watching Attenborough react to finding out Kruger's \"secret\". His laughter is both hilarious and pitiable. And the look of shock and confusion on Stewart's face says it all.\n\nAs you can tell, I love this movie. I cannot vote it or recommend it highly enough. You would be well served to find this on DVD. Enjoy and happy flying.",
