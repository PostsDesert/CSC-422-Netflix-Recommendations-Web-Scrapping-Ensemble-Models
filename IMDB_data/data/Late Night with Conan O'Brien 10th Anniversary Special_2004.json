        "reviewBody": "I have always loved Late Night ever since I first saw it in middle school. Conan is always spot on with his jokes, skits and the characters are always brilliant and wacky. Triumph is probably the greatest character the show has ever created but I still don't think he's as funny as Conan himself. This 10th anniversary special definitely showcases all of that and it does a very good job of it. There are some great appearances by Will Ferrell, Jack Black, Ben Stiller, William Shatner and even John Tesh. If you're a fan of the show, you absolutely cannot miss this one and need to see it immediately. It is on DVD so get off your ass, go to the store and purchase a copy right away!",
