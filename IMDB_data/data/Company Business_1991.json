GÃ©raldine Danon is certainly quite attractive and I appreciated the location work v. some bogus set. If you are looking for Oscar material you will need to pass on this one. On the other hand, if you like the talent (Hackman, et al) then you will probably find it worth your time to enjoy this. I can promise you there has been a great deal worse than this made by many times over."
