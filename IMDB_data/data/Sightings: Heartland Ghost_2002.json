Personally I quite like this movie, it still caught my attention through from the beginning to the end even I know the summary. I saw it alone after midnight and let me tell you it was really getting me scared and feeling like bewaring my back!!! If you used to see what was going on in real life with that family from tape of SIGHTINGS you know this movie is not bad. Not kind of making you jump from scary faces but gradually making you chill. It's good one!!! Watch it alone by yourself after midnight and remember it's something that really happened. Of course I don't know if it was true but if you just following like I said you will found how this movie could be scared. If you like kind of supernatural movie, fake or not I don't know, you will enjoy this film."
