I put this to DVD-R onto 2 dvds since it runs close to 3 hours. The DVD that is available to buy is 2 hours and has MANY scenes cut out!!!!\n\nI am sure there are not too many who have this complete as I do.\n\nWhen it was shown in the 1980's on PBS, it was shown for 2 weeks and it was a half hour each time so, when each one started it would say \"Episode 1\", \"Episode 2\" and so on. \n\nWhen it was first shown in December of 1976 here in the USA , it was shown over 2 nights and was on for 90 minutes both nights.\n\nI love this series so much I even have the original TV guide magazine from that week which has the \"Close Up\" review with a photo. What great memories it all is!\n\nIt is so enjoyable to watch on DVD-R and to see it the way it was made, totally complete and uncut!\n\nWell, I just wanted to share my joy about this. Just excited about it and, hope you enjoyed reading this :)",
