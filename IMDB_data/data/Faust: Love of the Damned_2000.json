        "reviewBody": "This movie lives by those words. Faust is simply a fluff film meant to have fun with. You people have got to stop saying that this film ripped off Spawn. This comic was published back in the 1980's! The 80's folks. Got that straight? Now, Faust is not a good movie, it's a good looking movie. It's stylishly done. Brian Yuzna has certainly progressed as a filmmaker. Screaming Mad George's effects are, as always, different. There is a strange lack of gore, however (most reviews kept talking about the gore, but they obviously have not seen other Yuzna/George collaborations). It does get a little far fetched when M turns the chick into a blob of goo. It's just ridiculous, I wish Yuzna would take his films more seriously sometimes. I mean, sometimes it's funny, but at others it's inappropriate. There is also a monster that looks dead-on like Dr. Freudstein in Fulci's House by the Cemetery. My other complaint comes during the subway scene. Why do they have to have sex after they escape danger? It's over the top to say the least. Faust does have a plus side. You've got a couple of cult favorites starring. Jeffrey Combs always adds something to a picture and Andrew Divoff is perfect as M. He has one of the most evil voices ever (I'm just not sure about that haircut). Mark Frost gets the award for gratuitous over-acting. It is a comic book movie though. There's also a great soundtrack. Nothing like some good old fashioned heavy metal to drive a violent flick.\n\n\"You can't cure evil, Dr. It's not a sickness.\""
