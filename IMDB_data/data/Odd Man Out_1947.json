I'm not a big fan of James Mason but he is excellent in this.\n\nAn unnamed organisation (the IRA) in an unnamed Norhern Irish city (Belfast) carry out an armed robbery that goes wrong. Johnny ends up shot, dying and on the run. The movie tracks the multiple stalking of this wounded, dying creature. Everyone wants a piece of him for different reasons.\n\nWhy the IRA and Belfast aren't named I don't know - perhaps the politics of the time caused this.\n\nSome aspects of the movie have dated somewhat, but much of it remains gripping and fascinating.\n\nHarold Pinter refers to it constantly in his play Old Times and you can imagine that a young Pinter would have been influenced by this movie.\n\nCheck this one out, for sure.",
