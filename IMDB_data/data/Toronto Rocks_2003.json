        "reviewBody": "In one sense, I would have loved to have been at this show. For the music, Rush most of all, and because I love Toronto. I can't even begin to imagine being in the midst of that many people, tho, and how much could most of them really hear or see? So I was quite eagerly anticipating the release of the DVD. Disappointing indeed that the full show was not included. I heard that each of the main acts (other than the Stones) was asked to choose 3 songs from their sets. I believe AC/DC's duet with the Stones was one of their choices, so I can see why AC/DC \"purists\" could be disappointed by that. Why did the Guess Who only have 2 songs, though, if they could have had 3? A prior reviewer complained about Sass Jordan getting 4 songs. I suspect that one of them was included because of the guest appearance by Jeff Healey on guitar, but why she still got 3 more is anybody's guess. Nothing against her, but...I would have liked to see more of some of the other bands. However, the one Justin Timberlake song (and his goofy duet with Mick later) were more than enough, though, thank you. It's not even because of his musical style, as you might think from a rocker like me, so much as that he's so embarrassingly amateur & such a fanboy & wannabe among all these rock veterans.",
