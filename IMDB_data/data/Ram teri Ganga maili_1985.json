        "reviewBody": "Raj Kapoor is supposed to be the ultimate showman of Bollywood. He does some justice to this image by choosing spectacular locales along with some great music and photography. \n\nHowever, there is nothing new this movie offers. It's an unconvincing love story set right at the foot of Himalayas, between a rich guy and a poor girl. How they meet, get separated and finally get united in the end forms the core of the story.\n\nMost of the Indians would remember this movie as the first one, at least the first blockbuster, where the heroine openly bares her breasts. (Such exposure is not very common in Indian movies.)\n\nApart from that dubious distinction, there is not much else.\n\nThe music is a blast and worth listening to. Give the movie itself a skip.",
