        "reviewBody": "I must put in a word of defense for this excellent movie, which was sadly underrated by both critics and audiences. The true story - of a Polish baker in Pittsburgh who raised his orphaned grandson at the age of 70+ and put him through medical school - sounds like a formula for sentimentality and cliches. However, the movie transcends that to become a moving story of the strength of family, with many wonderful touches of humor. Peter Falk's portrayal of the irascible, curmudgeonly, and indomitable Rocky Holzcek dominates the movie. We are made to care about all the people portrayed (well, maybe not the mother-in-law). I don't understand the criticism about the movie \"not having a story\" to tie it together. The changing relationship of Rocky and his family as the years go by has plenty of elements of drama. This movie touched me deeply. It's a real sleeper. I do question why they had to change the family in the original from Jewish to Catholic, but evidently the author was onboard with it.",
