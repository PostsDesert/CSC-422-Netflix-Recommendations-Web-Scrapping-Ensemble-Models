For a crime drama, it is not very gritty and is filled with Hollywood clich√©s.\n\nReasonably interesting but could have been great. However, there are so many Hollywoodisms and glamourisations it feels quite superficial.\n\nThe weak script and formulaic movie-for-the-masses directing by Brian De Palma are compounded by the usual unconvincing performance from Kevin Costner. He alternates between dead boring and overly gung ho here.\n\nSean Connery is almost equally flat and unconvincing.\n\nIn fact, there's hardly a convincing and/or engaging performance to be found here. The only good one comes from Robert De Niro who is charming and suitably mean and scary as Al Capone. \n\nVastly overrated.",
