        "reviewBody": "This is a cultural, musical and historical treasure trove of some of the greatest and most influential rock/pop musicians ever. Stand out performances for me were Queen, The Who and U2, I have watched them over and over. It is hours and hours of footage, and even after you have gorged yourself on it, there is still more! And then not even all the acts and songs were captured, as Geldof had originally requested that the event not be recorded!\n\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3604680.stm \n\nLive Aid was not only a great and memorable musical event, but a major technical achievement of its time. Remember this is in an era before the internet, mobile phones, when even sending and receiving an international fax was hit and miss. According to Wikipedia, an estimated 1.5 billion viewers, across 100 countries, watched the live broadcast. \n\nIt is also arguably the single biggest charity and cultural change event ever in terms of not only it scale, but its impact.\n\nBob Geldof always said, as acknowledged in the very name 'Band Aid', that the record and the ensuing concerts were a stop-gap - emergency relief. The point of the event was to raise money, yes, but also to put the issue of extreme poverty on the political agenda.\n\nBearing in mind that these kinds of immense social changes can take decades, it can be safely said that Live Aid did do just that by sowing some seeds of change.\n\nThe story of Live Aid and what it is about in its broadest sense has stayed with many people. It is bigger than its critics.\n\nFans of LIVE AID can also join a group on Facebook http://groups.to/liveaid",
