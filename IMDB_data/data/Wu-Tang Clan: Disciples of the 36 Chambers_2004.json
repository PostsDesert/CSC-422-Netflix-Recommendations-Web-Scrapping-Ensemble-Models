Though some of the songs are belated, the treat here is watching all nine members perform together, in some cases for the first time since the tracks were originally recorded. And these emcee masters do it flawlessly. Plus, it's probably the last time we'll get to see ODB jam it out.\n\nWith a new album from the Wu most likely years from seeing the light, this easily feeds a fans hunger, and with all the energy from the crowd and the enthusiasm of the nine members, it becomes hard not to \"sing-along.\""
