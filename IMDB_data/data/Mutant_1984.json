At times it may appear slow paced but despite that it remains effective, capturing your interest.\n\nGood acting. Good make-up. Good score. Not a lot of blood being spilled, just chemicals, transforming residents into zombie like creatures. A little gem, worth watching. It certainly worked for me.",
