        "reviewBody": "I had been hearing about Session 9 for a while now, and I finally decided to give it a go.\n\nFirst off, I have to say the film has incredibly nail-biting atmosphere. There were actually not that many 'scary' scenes, but it was what I feared would come. But don't let that fool you- this is a film that I will be afraid to think about when I go to sleep. The sound effects are incredibly tense and very creepy, to the point that they are disturbing. Certain images in the film are sure to stay with me for a long time. As far as plot goes, like I expected, I knew there would be a twist at the end, but the film does so many different things with itself that I never knew how it was going to come. When all is said and done, the actual twist isn't even all the surprising, BUT the final 20 minutes getting there are very, very tense and I could not look away. \n\nI also want to give a shout out to Peter Mullan, who gives a fascinating performance here. He is the driving force of the film. Also, the cinematography, editing, score, and sound make this perhaps one of the creepiest and unsettling films of its decade. I look forward to rewatching this."
