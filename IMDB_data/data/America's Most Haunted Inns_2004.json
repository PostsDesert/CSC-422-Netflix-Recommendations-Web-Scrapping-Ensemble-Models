        "reviewBody": "That was absolutely without a doubt the biggest waste of my time ever! I have watched many paranormal videos before but have never been so annoyed and bored at the same time. The only thing that saved this video were the Inn Keepers who told stories. Cathe the \"psychic\" spent most of her time talking to things that no one could see and telling Rob to \"get that\" on film. Over and over they showed photo after photo and then videos of \"orbs\" which looked very much like dust to me and everyone watching. Even worse was the \"amazing\" video at the end where they filmed something none of us could see and talked about it like it was remarkable. One of the most important things I've learned while doing ghost hunting was not to smoke so you can rule the smoke out as a possible factor in the pictures. They showed many photos with what looked like smoke swirling around then at the end one of the camera operators was walking around smoking! How professional was that for any type of investigator? I require more evidence from more credible sources and these were not those. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANT, YOUR MONEY PURCHASING IT!",
