But for me, the highlight of the movie was the dinner scene, with \"Moxy\" (Sophie Thompson) furiously biting her tongue while her clueless real-life sister (Jeanne Trippelhorn) concocts falsely slanderous stories about their mother, painting her as a bawdy alcoholic. Moxy's outraged cry of \"Jugs of Beer!?\" after Miranda/Freda leaves is priceless, as is her dressing down of Freda near the end of the film.\n\nI liked this film, too, because it didn't sink too far into the \"Silly Ass/Bright Young Thing\" mode that most of Coward's works tend to. Rent it if you can. It's worth catching."
