        "reviewBody": "NORTHANGER ABBEY is a charming version of the Jane Austen tale, covering somewhat familiar Austen territory in its tale of a young woman who comes to a vast estate and falls in love with an aristocratic young man who is willing to give up his inheritance to marry her, if he must.\n\nIt's beautifully lensed in color with excellent vistas of the English countryside and some impeccable performances from a first rate cast. FELICITY JONES and JJ FIELD are excellent as the young lovers, whether exchanging dialog that is on the humorous side or deadly serious, and CATHERINE WALKER is fine as Jones' confidante, Eleanor.\n\nTime constraints make it impossible to ever do full justice to Austen's stories, but fans of the author should find this an enchanting enough version of the tale to satisfy Janite admirers, even if there are many omissions in the telling.\n\nVery worthwhile, with high quality production values throughout.",
