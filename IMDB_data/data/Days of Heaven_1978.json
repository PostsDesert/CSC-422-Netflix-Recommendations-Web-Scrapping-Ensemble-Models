This man, Malick, stood twenty years out of business because he had to be, afterwards, after such a beautiful movie he couldn't and shouldn't return with any other thing shorter than this.\n\nDays Of Heaven is absolutely perfect cinema, the plot is not important, Malick simply wants to fill your senses and he achieves it.\n\nI haven't had the chance to watch it in a theatre, I was four years old at the time, I've watched it on television, and I understood immediately, this man is a hero for building up such a magnificent film in the United States, in Hollywood.\n\nA true director builds a universe of his own, with its own \"time flow\" and dreams and that is what Malick achieved with this film, magic, sacral art. Some sequences are \"almost\" (a big almost) Tarkovskyand this is a big commendation.",
