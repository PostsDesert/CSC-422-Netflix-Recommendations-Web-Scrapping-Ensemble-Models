Did they not see the first movie? Or perhaps they thought the original TV show was a cerebral example of 1970's TV programming.\n\nThe fact is if you liked the 2000 movie, with all the silly in-jokes, cultural references, campy soundtrack and frankly ridiculous stunts then you'll enjoy this one just as much. Maybe more because it also has Demi Moore looking amazing and a Jaclyn Smith cameo.",
