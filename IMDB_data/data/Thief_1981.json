The supporting cast is excellent, the edits are perfect, everything just clicks.\n\nAs has been noted by other reviewers, the technical aspects of this film are right on the money. All the locations are really there (or were at one time) and the settings didn't have to be faked up. Yes, Chicago and surrounding Chicagoland is really like this, folks.\n\nI try to watch this thing every few years. Should buy a DVD, I guess, and insert it into my permanent circular film buffer.\n\nHighly, highly recommended.",
