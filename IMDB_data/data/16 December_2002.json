It is one of his best movie.\n\nStory is good and make you sit for 2+ hour.\n\nThe best thing about the movie is screenplay which make it interesting. \n\nPlot is tight and fast paced. \n\nActing is not so good by the new actors.\n\nOnly Danny could impress with acting but it can be overlooked in exchange of good movie.\n\nso guys if you haven't seen it yet don't miss it.",
