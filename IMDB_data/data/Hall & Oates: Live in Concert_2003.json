        "reviewBody": "This is my review on hall pass. This movie definitely has its ups and downs. It has quite a few laughs but is kind of slow at other parts. I really like how this movie portrays women for what they are. Withholding sex from their husbands and then get mad at them for masturbating things like that watch the movie for more examples. I know women and they definitely pegged it right on the nose.\n\nThis movie is about two friends who are not so happy with their sex lives with their wives and are constantly fantasizing about sex with other women. The wives eventually get tired of this and grant them a hall pass. A hall pass is a week off from marriage in which they can do whatever they want. Party, have sex whatever. At first the two friends are excited about this but eventually they discover that picking up girls in your 40s is not as easy as when they were 20.\n\nThe thing that really bothers me in this movie are how the women are so mad at their men for fantasizing about other women that they grant them a hall pass out of last resort but all they had to do is just have sex with their husbands more. Not that I'm calling this movie fake im saying this is exactly the type of irrational behaviour women condone.\n\nOverall if your a guy and you love Owen Wilson watch this. If you are a girl and you don't want to have the truth about yourself put into movie format i suggest you stay away from this one."
