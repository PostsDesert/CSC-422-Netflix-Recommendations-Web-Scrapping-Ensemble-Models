Top actors of their day, in strong performances, play second fiddle to the story itself, which moves the viewer inexorably along to the final assault against \"The Guns\".\n\nI first saw this film in the theatre at age 11. I've seen it dozens of times since. It's not Ben-Hur, nor even Citizen Kane. It's just my favorite film."
