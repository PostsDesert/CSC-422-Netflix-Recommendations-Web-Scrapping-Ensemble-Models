This is not to say the long bits are bad. This is to say the only thing wrong with this disc set is that many of the bits from the people you want to see most are *very* short--and thus disappointing.\n\nFor example, Kelsey Grammar came on and went off what seems like a minute later, and then you're left asking yourself, \"did he *do* something?\"...Cheech Marin and Louie Anderson are in this category too...\n\nThere were bits that had a good time length, like Brad Garrett's, Richard Belzer, Carrot Top, Caroline Rhea, and Tim Allen...\n\nLook, I remember paying like $20 for this...for *five* DVDs of comedians you *have* mostly heard of, this is still a bargain...just don't expect everyone to be on very long or to be doing their best material.",
