The development of the main characters is too rushed, and the story races on at a breakneck pace. \"Posse' borrowed liberally from the \"spaghetti westerns\" ( revenge flashbacks as in \"For a Few Dollars More\", gattling gun as in \"A Fistful of Dollars\", coming of the railroad as in \"Once Upon a Time in the West\") The movie tries to accomplish too much too quickly, and makes one wish that the deliberate pace of the \"spaghetti westerns\" had also been \"borrowed\". I rate it a 5.0, very average, and a missed opportunity. - MERK",
