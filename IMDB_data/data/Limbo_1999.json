        "reviewBody": "Don't Believe the Type (...below). John Sayles' Limbo is a slow-burning, stonker of a movie! The character interaction and dialogue are sublime and subtle. Personally I love to see David Strathairn in the lead role, and it is to Sayles' credit that he has, and continues to give this deft actor a chance to shine. For those who have complained about the 'boring storyline' and 'dissapointing finale' I feel sorry, really very sorry - Sorry, that you could not enjoy the films' depth and intelligence as I did. And if you didn't like the ending, then well, you just don't get it, do you?\n\nTops marks Mr. Sayles, One of your Best!!"
