I can even remember the lyrics to \"Hey Little Goldfish\" and \"Glub, Glub\"!! As kids we sang those songs for years. I can't wait to rent this one and rock out again with Dreyfuss and the gang! I hope he doesn't mind too much, 'cause I think this movie is a great sixties artifact, with a fun cast and very creative sets."
