        "reviewBody": "David Howard (played by Albert Brooks) and his wife, Linda Howard (played by Julie Hagerty) have the good life and everything that goes with it and are just about to move into their California dream house. However, they begin to wonder if their lives have become too responsible and controlled. Escape for them presents itself when David doesn't get the long awaited corporate promotion to senior vice president and he quits his job- or is fired, you be the judge. David then convinces his wife that \"they have been on the road to no where- you know the road,\" and she quits her job. Now they're free to head for open spaces and purse their dream to \"just touch Indians.\"\n\nQuickly they sell everything and escape from yuppiedom with their \"nest egg\" intact. They. get the motor runnin'. in their new motor home and. head out on the highway. a la Easy Rider. At that moment life is wonderful and toasted cheese never tasted better. One quick stop in Las Vegas and they will be on their way to touch Indians. But in less time than it takes to say \"22\", their \"nest egg\" is depleted, their marriage in peril, and they are hopelessly lost in America.\n\nNot to fear, while temporarily lost they rediscover their love for each other, get a good dose of small town life, and decide to rejoin the \"rat race\".\n\n\"Lost in America\" should strike a chord with especially those that saw \"Easy Rider\" and repressed the impulse to drop out of society. Great, great, writing by Albert Brooks and Monica Johnson. Brooks and Hagerty are successful in creating the same type of zany marital chemistry and intensity which existed in \"I Love Lucy\", \"The Honeymooners\", and \"All in the Family\". This movie is great therapy!"
