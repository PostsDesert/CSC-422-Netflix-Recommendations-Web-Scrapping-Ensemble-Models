        "reviewBody": "A sequel to the enjoyable Analyze This, 'Analyze That' is a partly funny sequel, that never achieves the wit & energy of its prequel, but works in its own way nonetheless. Despite a few shortcomings, there are some genuine laughs to be had here!\n\n'Analyze That' Synopsis: Mobster Paul Vitti is released into Dr. Ben Sobol's care, where only more chaos ensues.\n\n'Analyze That' has a strong first-hour, where the humor works. But, the second-hour slips into predictability & is low on laughs. In short, a lively first-hour is its high, but an underwhelming second-hour is its low!\n\nKenneth Lonergan, Peter Tolan, Peter Steinfeld & Harold Ramis's Screenplay works in bits & pieces. One certainly is missing the wit of its much superior prequel. Ramis's Direction is decent, as always. Ramis knew his job & his loss makes his work all the more precious. \n\nPerformance-Wise: Robert De Niro & Billy Crystal reprise their parts, most admirably. De Niro is simply brilliant as the don with a soft heart, while Crystal is responsible for the film's best laughs. Joe Viterelli, in his final role. is excellent. Lisa Kudrow is lovely in a small, but significant role.\n\nOn the whole, 'Analyze That' isn't all-out funny, but it succeeds in making you laugh at parts.",
