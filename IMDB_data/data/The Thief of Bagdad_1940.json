        "reviewBody": "One of the most enjoyable fantasies of all time (with flying horses, flying carpets, dancing idols, daring escapes) is given even more dimension by the performance of Conrad Veidt as the villainous Jaffar. He is the perfect embodiment of a fairytale villain and gives the film the extra punch it needs.\n\nJune Duprez has never been more beautifully photographed as the princess and John Justin and Sabu do well as the prince and thief (respectively) who have to settle a score with Conrad Veidt. All of it is handsomely costumed and photographed in the subdued technicolor common to British films at the time (which has a washed out look in some sections of the video print I own).\n\n Filmed under harsh wartime conditions, it nevertheless managed to win three Academy Awards for Special Effects, Color Cinematography and Color Art Direction. An enjoyable treat for young and old.\n\nOne has to wonder what Universal might have done with this story material if produced for their co-starring team of Maria Montez and Jon Hall."
