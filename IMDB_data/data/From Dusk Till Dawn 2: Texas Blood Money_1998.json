        "reviewBody": "I only caught the \"edited\" version on Sci-Fi Channel, but must admit that I found this to be a mildly entertaining film. It takes a basic ideas (vampires robbing a bank) and goes with it and runs.\n\nThe problem is that that's really all there is, and there's not much running track. Like the original, it tries to stay \"reality\" grounded as a caper flick, but given this is a shorter movie, this goes on _way_ too long before you actually get to vampires.\n\nOnce we get the first guy bit by a vampire, it moves along to \"vampires rob a bank\" and \"vampires shoot it out with police.\" But...that's really about it. The writers seemed to have run out of ideas, and so we just get interminable variations on these two basic ideas. There is no real climax - the vampire bad guys are subsequently interchangeable, and the only really competent one (Jesus) gets killed before the formerly-dimwitted one. The ending is just one big shootout, prolonged by a convenient solar eclipse. Which is another pointless plot point - if you want vampires to be in the darkness, just keep them in darkness and have the sun come up normally. Adding the solar eclipse does nothing here. It's stuff like this which suggests the writers didn't know quite what they were doing.\n\nAs for the Raimi-esque POV shots, a little goes a long way - something that Scott Spiegel should have learned from the master. It's kinda fun the first twenty times, but after that...\n\nOverall, I'd recommend it if you can catch it on the cheap. It's no classic, but it's mildly amusing.",
