Many colorful minor characters that really represent the scene well. The Ru Paul cameo was a nice touch.\n\nIt's not gimmicky or trying to be funny. It's actually genuinely funny in spots, but mostly it is just very endearing and heartwarming. Brings back memories of childhood, no matter who you are or when you grew up, you'll relate to some aspect of this movie. \n\nIt's a feel-good, coming of age, chaos and struggle of life movie through the eyes of Troy, the only girl of 5 children of a lower class family in New York.\n\nAlfre Woodard and Zelda Harris are fantastic. Harris is quite the little actress.",
