        "reviewBody": "It angers me when films like this get such low ratings. I mean if your expecting an oscar winning film with hulk hogan the you can get to mars. This film is enjoyable to watch when your young and quite fun to watch when your a teenager as well as it brings back childhood memories. I was looking at the ratings for another childhood favourite - \"ghost dad\". i mean why can't people just enjoy the film and if you don't like it then quite simply change the channel!! Its not that hard a thing to do. Hulk Hogan is a funny guy to watch as a wrestler and as an actor and i think it is unfair that films with him in it are rated so low cos a lot of people enjoy his work. So every smart ass reviewer can just take him in the right context or not watch anything by him if they expect him to actto an oscar winning standard. Anyway i've had my little rant, i love films like this!"
