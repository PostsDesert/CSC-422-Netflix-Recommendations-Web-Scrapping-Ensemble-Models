        "name": "Chuck Norris vehicle as tough Colonel Braddock and followed by two sequels",
        "reviewBody": "A Vietnam war vet (Chuck Norris) and previous POW goes back to Vietnam ten years after . When Braddock arrives is accused of war crimes by a Vietnam general (James Hong) . He then schemes to free some American soldiers still held prisoners in a far prison camp into Vietnam . As long as he's there , Braddock decides to head Thailand where is pursued by a former enemy who tortured him in the concentration camp where he was prisoner . He's helped by a gunrunner friend (M. Emmet Walsh) . The two-fisted Colonel Braddock tries continuously to free the prisoners held captives suffering various tortures in charge of the camp wardens and the evil ruler. \n\nThis is a routine actioner with Karate star Chuck Norris as the Vietnam veteran resulting go be one of the best roles he'd made to date , as he's nice as tough , cold and stubborn Colonel Braddock . It's a predictable , shallow and brainless film , though it will appeal to Chuck Norris enthusiasts because of it contains some excellent action sequences (when Braddock shoots with his machine gun or scenes about bounds and leaps aboard a motorboat) . Chuck stated that he made this picture as a memorial honor of his younger brother who was a war casualty in the long Vietnam conflict . In the wake of ¨ Uncommon courage ¨(by Ted Kotcheff) and ¨ Rambo II ¨(George Pan Cosmatos) with Norris attempting to imitate Silver Stallone or Arnold Schwarnezzegger like an one army man . \n\nThe film is the original from a trilogy , concerning the second part (directed by Lance Hool , the first one 's producer) about tortures and Braddock suffering in a prisoner camp , and the third part (directed by Aaron Norris , Chuck's brother , who in 'Missing in action 1' was the stunt coordinator) upon looking for his wife after downfall Saigon . Shot right after Missing in action 2 (1985) , this movie was supposed to be the follow-up . Nevertheless, when ¨Cannon¨ realized this film was the better of the two , they re-titled them and made the other film a prequel . In the three movies there are some nasty , ominous villains well played by Asian players : James Hong , Soon Teck Oh , and Aki Aelong , who bear offensive racial stereotypes . Appropriate musical score by Jay Chattaway and adequate as well as atmospheric cinematography by cameraman Joao Fernandez , filmed in Philippines . The motion picture produced by Cannon films (Mennahem Golan and Yoram Globus) was professionally directed by Joseph Zito (USA invasion , again with Norris). The motion picture will appeal to Chuck Norris fans .",
