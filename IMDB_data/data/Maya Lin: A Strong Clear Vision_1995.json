        "reviewBody": "Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision (1994) \n\n*** (out of 4)\n\nGood documentary on architect Maya Lin who at the age of twenty had her work selected to become the Vietnam Memorial. Throughout the documentary we see her original concept and the controversy that followed because many vets thought it was going to be an insult to them and there were many people who objected because of her Asian race. Years later we see the work in progress of the Civil Rights memorial where we watch Lin as she tries to come up with a new design and make sure her vision gets across. MAYA LIN: A STRONG CLEAR VISION won the Best Documentary Oscar and while it's not a masterpiece it's at least very entertaining and it really gives one a great look at all the issues that went into the Vietnam memorial. I thought the documentary really did a very good job at showing the entire process that went from selecting the person to do the memorial and then we get into the controversy that followed. I liked the fact that the documentary didn't just show the good stuff but instead showed the controversial aspects of the work and call out some of the people who said some questionable things about the creator not because of a lack of talent but because she was a woman, young and Asian. Through archival footage we get to see a lot of this back and forth heat and it really makes you see how questionable a lot of it was. The Civil Rights stuff doesn't take up too much time but it's respectfully done and it's nice having Lin talk about the creation. We also get a brief bio on Lin, which gives some good information. With all of that said, the strongest moment of the film happens when we get to see various Vietnam vets reactions to the monument."
