        "reviewBody": "Well though this series really brought out all the hidden demons within Paris and Nicole, and made the whole world realize their true trashy/snobby/dimwitted/unbearable personalities, i must admit this is THE BEST REALITY TV SHOW I HAVE EVER SEEN. I believed it to be TV's best guiltiest pleasure. Seeing Paris and Nicole willingly slandering their image to an extent that people in the designated village actually yelled \"Go home RICH B**CH,\" was quite the treat. Though some people may believe that this was done for no reason - and it was absolutely worthless - i completely disagree. After seeing this we can OFFICIALLY conclude that Paris Hilton is a 100% spoiled air- head, who can be a very nice person, and Nicole is a sexually frustrated, uncontrollable wild child with an insensitive sense of humour,whose jokes result in an \"OH MY GOSH!\" reaction rather than a laugh riot. So i must wonder - if each and every celebrity acquires such a sense of personality that no one but their home town can accept? well as for Paris and Nicole let them just enjoy their cash cause besides their looks, that's the only thing theyv'e got."
