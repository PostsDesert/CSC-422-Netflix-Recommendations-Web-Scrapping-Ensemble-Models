        "reviewBody": "\"The Mythical Detective, Loki Ragnarok,\" can truly be said one of the best anime and manga that has ever been created. It is based on the Norse god of mischief, his friends and his family. Like in the real myth, Loki is an outcast because of his mischeivious ways. Banned to earth, and trapped in a body of his child version, he must collect evil auras in order to return to Asgard. \n\nAs a fan of Norse mythology, I found that Loki proved to be interesting. So what if the characters are cute and funny? If you can't understand why they look this way, you are not a true fan of anime. It is so great, I own every volume of the anime series and Manga, and I can name every episode forwards and backwards. Every one of my friends, and my family all love this anime. If you want something honestly worth watching, check out my friend Loki! Yes, you may call me a fanatic!!! ^_^",
