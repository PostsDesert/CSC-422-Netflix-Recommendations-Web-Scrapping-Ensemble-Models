This is a shameless promotion of a book that attempts to compare itself to the Da Vinci Code.\n\nI never read the book the Da Vinci Code but I respected the reviews it got and made me curious enough to watch FREE documentaries on how the story was put together and what it was based upon. As I continue on this critique you must understand that I have been a theology hobbist for close to 3 decades. The reason I did not read the book is because it was Fiction and I really like hard facts backed up by history, anthropology, archeology, etc. So when I say this documentary was not remotely informative except for the flimsy way the book was constructed, I am giving this advice from the benefit of my passions.\n\nSkip this movie or you will loose moments of your life that are lost forever.",
