        "reviewBody": "Ex-Disney animator Don Bluth brings us a tail (sorry, TALE! Well, that's the proper word in the context!) of the Russian Mousekewitz mouse family, who, like all of the other mice in late 1800's Russia, want to escape from the cats. They dream of a land known as America, where there are no cats. Travelling to\n\nGermany, they board a ship bound for America.\n\nHowever, during a violent storm, little Fievel Mousekewitz (voiced by Phillip Glasser) becomes separated from his parents and sisters. Fortunately for Fievel he was saved from drowning by being ensconced within a bottle, which quite by chance floats to New York, USA. Unfortunately not only is America very big, but it -- well, let's just say that for all mice concerned it's not all it was cracked up to be.\n\nWith the help of friends such as Tony Toponi (voiced by Pat Musick) and Tiger (Dom DeLuise), Fievel goes on a mammoth quest to become reunited with his\n\nfamily.\n\nAlthough it is a little on the sentimental side, it does have a certain charm, which is further helped by James Horner's musical score, as well as the wonderful\n\nsong 'Somewhere Out There' which has since become my favourite duet of all\n\ntime (I've even sung the end-credits version, as sung by Linda Ronstadt and\n\nJames Ingram, on Karaoke!). Some adults may not like the sentimentality, but stick with it, and you'll be rewarded with a gem, particularly if watching with either the young or the young-at-heart."
