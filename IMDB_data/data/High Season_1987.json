        "reviewBody": "High Season is a film to be viewed over and over. It's like a trip to the Greek Islands. The element of crime, along with the \"love-gone-wrong\" factor, the elegance and charm of Jackie Bisset, and of course, the unapologetically gorgeous setting of the Agean Sea, all lend a magical air to this film. It will appeal to anyone who had ever been to the islands. One can almost smell the heady marine breezes billowing about. Kenneth Branagh adds that touch of \"Duh?\" and his mousey whiney wife is the perfect foil. When he becomes enamored of Jackie he is has all the charm of a besotted fish! but he's still in character. The fact that Jackie's character fails to capture in her photo journal The Light of Greece, only emphasizes the fact that Greece is to be experienced, NOT read about or understood through pictures. Clare Peploe is pure genius with this film. It's a constant treat!",
