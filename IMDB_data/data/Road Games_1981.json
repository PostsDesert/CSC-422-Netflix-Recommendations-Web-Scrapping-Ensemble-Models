There are decent performances all around, save for the horrible police officers. They must have been the real thing.\n\nPros: High suspense, well-written characters, great use of a low budget, good plot twist, keeps you guessing, fine ending.\n\nCons: Drags in spots, dialogue can be pretentious and unrealistic, a few continuity issues, with respect to sequencing.\n\nFor a PG rated movie, this is rather adult themed and creepy, if not scary. I recommend this film to all.",
