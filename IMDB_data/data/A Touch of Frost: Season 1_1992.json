        "reviewBody": "What a great detective series! \"A touch of Frost\" does not contain any stupid gunfights or rediculous unrealistic carchases. In a way, even the \"whodunnit-part\" is rather secondary in this series. Many of the cases that he must solve are not at all remarkable or especially spectacular. Instead, it all seems to come very close to real life police work. The real strength, then, lies in the very good characterization of the dramatis personae. Victims, criminals and most of all Frost himself are shown as people of flesh an blood. With their problems, their moods, their backgrounds... You really start to care for them, and that's why the rather trivial situations shown here are more powerful than typically poorly characterized people being killed by evil serial killers. With some mild humour inserted in places, you end up with a very good mix.\n\nHighly recommended quality series, worth to stay at home for!"
