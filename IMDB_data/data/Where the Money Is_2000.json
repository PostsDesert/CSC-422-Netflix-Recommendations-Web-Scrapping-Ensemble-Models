        "reviewBody": "I became a fan of Linda Fiorentino from watching her on Dogma over and over again on Comedy Central. I hope she's getting residual checks and new fans all over again. In this film, she plays Carol Ann McKay, a bored nurse in a retirement or nursing home who meets Paul Newman's character who is a retired professional heister. With her husband played by Dermot Mulroney, the three plan the ideal heist with an armored car. I read that Fiorentino and Newman got along very well on the film and both live in the same town in Connecticut. Fiorentino would have been willing to do a sex scene with him if she was given the opportunity. Anyway, the three are a great team. The story is pretty good because Fiorentino, Newman, and Mulroney make the lines come alive. I wish Fiorentino and Newman were still working making movies. As you get older in this business particularly females, you are over the hill over 40 years old. For men, it's different but even Newman has given up the acting part of the business because it's so uninspiring. Films like this never do well at the box office. It could have done very well on television or cable. Fiorentino is stunning at the end of the film. It's not all about the money as it is about getting away with it and the thrills and adrenalin of being and feeling alive.",
