        "reviewBody": "I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this movie. The trailers that I'd remembered seeing were pretty funny, but I'd assumed that those were the best parts of Double Take. Anyway, I watched it nonetheless and didn't think it was half bad. There were several parts not included in the trailer that were laugh-out-loud funny. Some might be offended by the fact that Griffen's character is (in the filmic sense) a \"coon.\" Although nowhere near as good a comedy as Blazing Saddles, it is comparable in certain aspects. Double Take could be considered racist, but like Blazing Saddles, it uses racial stereotypes to emphasize the stupidity of their existence. Here, instead of black vs. white, we see upper-class African-Americans ashamed of the Sambo stereotype, and thus not associating with other African-Americans with lower social status. I'm not sure if this message was intentional in Double Take, but it was there nonetheless. Orlando Jones had a pretty good performance and Griffen was a convincing character (some might say he was over-the-top, but again I'd say this was essential). One problem was that the movie quite suddenly switched gears from a comedy to a somewhat serious action/suspense flick. I felt the heavy emphasis upon the latter took away from its comic moral message and made the movie shallower. So, it had potential. They could have recruited a few more writers to add in funnier jokes. All in all, a 6 out of 10.",
