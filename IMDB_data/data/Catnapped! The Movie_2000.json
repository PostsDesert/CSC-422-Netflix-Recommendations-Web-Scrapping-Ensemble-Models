Its not perfect and should be longer then the 75 minutes of its running time. Its one of those movies, and lord knows there aren't many, that has its heart in the right place. Its one where because you get this vibe off it that it knows what its doing even if its not perfectly done.... I think there are things I would have done differently but I won't quibble since I simply enjoy whats there. I have no idea how the dub is since I have it subtitled, but that said its a cool movie with everyone turning into balloons",
