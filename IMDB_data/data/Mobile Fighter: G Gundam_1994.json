        "reviewBody": "Mobile Fighter G Gundam. One of my personal favorites (and believe me, I have seen every Gundam series around. Blarg to Victory Gundam! Blarg, I say!) Anyway. This anime is often overlooked for it's rather flashy, and cheesy setting and mechs. And I agree, it has it's bad points, often in a little bit of plot inconsistancy. (Neo England's fighter goes evil? What?) However, it's other features save it. The Gundams and the fighters themselves are incredibly diverse and interesting. You've got a boxer wanting to live out the American Dream, a Russian space pirate fighting for his comrades, a French knight... not to mention a German ninja! Other than the few holes, the plot is very interesting, and can get rather emotional at times. Mecha designs are so diverse, you never get the same thing twice, save when the Shining becomes the God Gundam. You've got a bit of symbolism, in God Gundam vs. Devil Gundam, and it's interesting to note that the Shuffle Alliance is almost exactly the UN Security Council. I must say, though, the worst thing about this anime is it's dub. It makes me want to cry. They rename things for no reason. Some I can understand, but still think should be unchanged. (God Gundam, Devil Gundam, possibly Tequila Gundam) Others are changed for absolutely no reason. Lumber Gundam, based around a lumberjack, uses axes for weapons, etc., changed to the Grizzly Gundam. Gundam Spiegel, Neo-Germany's Gundam, is changed to the Shadow Gundam. Oh no! They might not understand that the German Gundam's name is in German! Better change it! The voice actors themselves seem un-emotional, and speak halting-ly. If you have the option, never watch it. Watch it subbed instead. Though I do admit the ending is uber-cheesy. LOVE LOVE TENKYOKEN!"
