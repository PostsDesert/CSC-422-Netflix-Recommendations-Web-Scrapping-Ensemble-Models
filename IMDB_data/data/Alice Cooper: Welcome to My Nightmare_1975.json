At that time, I was getting over the fear of him, or actually the snakes. I have hated snakes since I stood on one when I was six. But, he is a great showman and his stage antics made an excellent show/concert.\n\nAny fan of the Masters or classics have to see this. I cannot figure out what my favorite part of it was, but Vincent Price was a great touch. It is strange that \"Welcome to my Nightmare\" was considered \"acid rock\" and now is seems so much more mellow compared to today's music.\n\nI lived in Phoenix and just about everyone there knows him or has met him a few times and he is very approachable and a great guy. He gives back a lot to the community and does a lot of good with some of his fund raisers. Not to mention, he owns half the town. He should run for governor again, \"a messed up governor for a messed up state\" is an understatement for those who live or have lived in Arizona.\n\nBut, any one interested in the History of Rock needs to see this. It is a great story and he is a great showman and puts on a good show.",
