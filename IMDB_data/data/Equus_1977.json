        "reviewBody": "I want people watch this film with an open mind but they have to be mature and understanding. Alan Strang is disturbed young man who has a disturbed fascination with horses. He places them in the godlike category. His relationship only gets worse when he works at a stable barn. There, he has almost a bestial relationship with the animals there. When he finally confronts a relationship with a fellow stable girl played nicely by Jenny Agutter. When he feels watched and betrays his god, he commits the most disturbing crime. Warning, this film is not for children or some adults with weak stomachs. There is full nudity of both Firth and Agutter in the movie. There also wonderful performances by Dame Eileen Atkins and Dame Joan Plowright in this film.",
