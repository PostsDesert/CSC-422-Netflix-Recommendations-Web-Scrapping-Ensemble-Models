        "reviewBody": "Doris Day moved into middle-age with grace and self-effacing charm; \"With Six You Get Eggroll\", her final film, was worked over by four screenwriters and may not be a comedy classic, but Doris plays it with conviction anyhow. As a widow with three boys who begins dating a widower--a single father and acquaintance of her late husband's--Day is quick to laugh, fast with the quips, canny and clever and bright. Spying Brian Keith's sexy neighbor \"out for a walk\" in the early evening, Doris's dry remark, \"It's a nice night for streetwalking\", is delivered nonchalantly but with icy accuracy. She works hard to befriend Keith's mercurial teenage daughter (Barbara Hershey, in her film debut) but, when that blows up in her face, she and Keith have an argument that is too loud and mean for a cute suburban comedy (the point here--that Day was finally able to make a connection with the girl--is lost and never recovered). The kids are all realistically abrasive and selfish--in need of Life Lessons--and there are fine supporting turns by Pat Carroll, Herb Voland and Alice Ghostley (and George Carlin in a bit); however, the paste-up/give-up happy ending must have looked like a groaner even in (or, especially in) 1968. \"Eggroll\" has some funny things to say about step familial relationships and rules, teenage possessiveness, and dating after 40. Unlike the not-dissimilar \"Yours, Mine and Ours\", this one gets its message across utilizing only four children, which is a bargain indeed. *** from ****",
