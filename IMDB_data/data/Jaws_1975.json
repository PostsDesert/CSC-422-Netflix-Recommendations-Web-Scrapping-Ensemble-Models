I jumped, I held my breath; this was one of the experiences that made me fall in love with movies. This was probably the first film where I completely forgot everything around me. I was there, in that boat, in that gloomy cabin, with those people - everything seemed so real (and alas, the sea never looked the same again). When I watch it these days I still marvel: the atmosphere and the performances in this film are simply magical. Spielberg without the schmalz. He has never been better.\n\nMy vote: 10 out of 10\n\nFavorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",
