The show was about many true mysteries such as disappearances and among other things. One particular episode that was very good was about the mysteries of the Bermuda Triangle. It was incredible that so many planes of all kinds and boats and vessels disappeared and that these planes and boats have never returned and that this strange phenomenon is still happening today. There were also some quite scary ghost stories as well in other episodes. If this series still airs today make sure you watch it if you are a fan of mysteries because it was a great show! I recommend it!"
