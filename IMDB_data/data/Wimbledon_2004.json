        "reviewBody": "Well, first of all it's a British movie. It couldn't have been completely bad, I mean, they have humour. It did smell a little of Notting Hill and other UK romantic comedies that put together a charming Englishman and an American starlet, but it was all original. As original as a sports movie can be, of course. There is always the tension of the \"big championship\" mixed with the tension of the romantic relationship and sprinkled with tension relaxing humour. Play those buttons right and you've got the instant orgasm.\n\nBut it wasn't all recipe. There were some very inventive shots of the tennis ball and some good jokes. They didn't overdo it, either, so it wasn't something you keep laughing at. James McAvoy played a ridiculously small part, while Kirsten Dunst seemed awake the entire course of the film. No partially fainted declarations of love in a slow almost inaudible voice in this movie. Sam Neil, an actor that I like, despite some poor choices in films he chose to play in, plays her slightly controlling dad who comes through in the end.\n\nPaul Bettany has it going on. He has that lovely accent, good looks and, from what I have seen in his movies, a very large emotional range that he can easily express. I am looking forward to more of his films.\n\nBottom line: good to watch with the girl, it contains nothing spectacular or some amazing twist, but it is a decent easy going romantic sports movie that makes almost no mistakes.",
