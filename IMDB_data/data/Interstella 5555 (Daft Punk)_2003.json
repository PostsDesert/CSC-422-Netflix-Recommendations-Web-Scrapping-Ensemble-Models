These guys understood that a good music could lead to an \"high life\", they know how to move us, how to reveal \"something about us\". Let them take you on this space journey, whether it's on the \"voyager\" shuttle or not, you'll find it \"veridis quo\". It's a \"short circuit\" (only 68 min, the length of the \"Discovery\" album) but in the end, when you find \"face to face\" with yourself, you can only feel like you would want some more, like it could never have been \"too long\".",
