        "reviewBody": "This movie starts off with the President of the United States, \"Gerald Fitzhugh\" (Louis Gossett Jr.) sitting at his desk in a bombed out White House lamenting the day he gave up America's sovereignty to \"Nicolae Carpathia\" (Gordon Currie). The film then backtracks a bit to an assassination attempt upon him which manages to kill the Vice-President, \"John Mallory\" (Charles Martin Smith). It's at this point that we learn there are two groups who oppose Nicolae Carpathia: (1) The militias who intensely dislike the surrender of America's sovereignty and (2) Christians who refuse to accept the leadership of the anti-Christ. Naturally, Nicolae wants both groups destroyed and he comes up with a plan to discredit the first and another plan to decimate the second. Now, as far as the overall film is concerned I have to say that this turned out to be a major disappointment. Not only does it substantially deviate from the book but the last fourth of the movie was simply too preposterous to be believed. Along with that, I didn't think the movie flowed very smoothly from one scene to the next. That said, if there is going to be a fourth film in this series I would hope that it is made with a view towards reality and Biblical accuracy. Below average.",
