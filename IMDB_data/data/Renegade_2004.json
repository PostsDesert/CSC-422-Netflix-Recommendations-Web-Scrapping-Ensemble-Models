        "reviewBody": "The film deals with a young Blueberry (Hugh O'Connor) who after a hideous experience he swears vengeance against a villain (Michel Madsen). Adult Blueberry (Vincent Cassell) is appointed as sheriff in a little town , he's helped by an old man (Ernest Borgnine) and a rough and ragged gunman (Colm Meany) . They will have to confront nasties and a greed bunch (Michael Madsen , Eddie Izzard , Djimon Honsou) that are looking for a treasury at Indian territory commanded by Apaches Chiricagua (leading Temuera Morrison) . When gold fever strikes white enemies invade their sacred mountains and Indians raid them . On his way, Blueberry meets a lot of villains on a persistent mission to find gold in the Superstition Mountains . \n\nThis exciting movie blends western action , shootouts , breathtaking landscapes with hallucinogenics shots ; besides, a little bit of violence and nudism . The final confrontation amongst the starring and contenders is overblown with amazing as well as thrilling images . Passable acting by Vincent Cassel , though Val Kilmer was originally offered the headlining role but respectfully declined . Willem Dafoe and Benicio Del Toro were then considered for the role of Mike Blueberry, but Jan Kounen remembered conversations he had about shamanism with his friend Vincent Cassel and chose him instead . The picture has gotten classification apt +18 , because of the crude murders , sex and violence are varied . Strange storyline by Gerard Brach , Polanski's usual screenwriter , from an original Jean Giraud (Moebius)'s comic book . However , being much better the drawings ; thus , the film is quite boring and isn't well paced . The motion picture obtained limited success , in United States achieved a few box office , in Europe attained money enough . Film outdoors are spellbound and overwhelming , it's the best part of the movie . Jean Kounen direction is mediocre , cinematography in Super35mm Panavision by Tetsuo Nagata is enjoyable and musical score is atmospheric . The flick will appeal to peculiar and queer western buffs. Rating : Mediocre , 5.5/10 . Well worth seeing for the extraordinary landscapes.",
