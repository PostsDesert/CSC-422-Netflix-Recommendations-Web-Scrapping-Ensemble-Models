        "reviewBody": "I have made quite a vast essay on the Cuban revolution in my last year at high school and I must say that this documentary has shown me things that go against everything I've read on the death of Che Guevara. The young filmmakers confront people the whole world had forgotten about and know to make them feel very uncomfortable. From time to time the film tends to use its images a tad manipulative, but I don't see that as a problem, after all, the world's most popular critical filmmaker Michael Moore has made a quite living out of giving coloured information. Sacrificio has some nice use of music (drum 'n bass) and images (often grainy footage, flashy use of older footage), sometimes giving the film the look of a video clip. A very important film, that everyone with even only a passing interest in Cuba should see.",
