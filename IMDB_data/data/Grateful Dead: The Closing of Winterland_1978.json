        "reviewBody": "You certainly get a lot of bang for your buck in this nostalgic concert DVD. It's nostalgic now because the footage took place just over 30 years ago on the last concert night on the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco.\n\nYou gets hours and hours of songs from two full discs worth of mostly-mellow Grateful Dead material. You get to see a dark-haired and slimmer Jerry Garcia perform his guitar magic.\n\nYou also get to see what a lot of Dead fans probably never saw: a female singer doing a bunch of the songs along with the guys That was Donna Godchaux, who did both lead and backup vocals. She and her husband Keith sang with the famous rock group throughout the 1970s. Keith died at the age of 32 after an auto accident in 1980.\n\nIn addition to the tons of music, there are a lot of extras, from features on the Winterland Ballroom, to the Blues Brothers with Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, bonus songs, on and on. If you enjoy the Dead, this is the DVD to buy.",
