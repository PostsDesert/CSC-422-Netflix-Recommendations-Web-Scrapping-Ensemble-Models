        "reviewBody": "I saw this film shortly after it came out. I was very impressed with its simple story line and the fact that it was not a Hollywood story.\n\nHow many times have you gone to see a film mainly because of the actor or actress? \"Ulee's Gold\" name talent but it has so much more. Peter Fonda grabs the attention of many of his fans and critics. This time he proves that he can be in an independent feature and wow the audience. Patricia Richardson (Home Improvement) also does a very good job of being a strong woman and good neighbor to the dysfunctional Jackson family.\n\nThis film will at times be slow, but that is the way that it was intended. The action does build through the film and you will understand its tempo. It pulls you into the world of Ulee Jackson (Fonda) and his desperation to keep not only his family but himself and his \"bee colony\" together.\n\nThe locations were real places and were shot mostly in existing structures. One very interesting thing to note is that the film looks like it was shot in natural lighting. It is so natural that you may not notice how it was lit.\n\nIf you like independent films you will love \"Ulee's Gold\""
