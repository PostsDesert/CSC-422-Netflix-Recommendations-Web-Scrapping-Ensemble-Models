        "reviewBody": "The Omen still can be considered one of the best and scariest horror movies ever made. Even if Richard Donner himself was seeing it more as a detective story (and there is some truth to that), the movie worked as a horror movie and having a kid in the dead centre of it ... scary to say the least.\n\nThis also depicts and talks about the sequels. Quite honestly at some places, it does know what it owes to the very first one. This was made way before the sequel was greenlit and made and there was no TV show either. But it had the 4 movies to talk about (again the first one has the bulk and the most interesting things to tell) and a tv project that fell to pieces. A tv show that Richard Donner gave his name for, but as he states here had nothing to do with ... and was anything but pleased by. It also does not seem to be connected to the Omen movies - apart from sharing the title.\n\nI almost want to seek that failed pilot show ... it seems intriguing - even/despite or maybe even because it has nothing to do with the Omen movies ... anyway interesting documentary, much has been discussed in commentaries of the individual movies, but if you have not heard them yet, this can be quite eye opening.",
