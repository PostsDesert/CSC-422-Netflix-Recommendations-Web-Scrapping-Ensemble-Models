It is possibly the worst example of documentary film making I have ever seen. The only reason I am writing this review is to add my voice to the chorus in an effort to save you time and disappointment. I only wish someone I done the same for PFC Ryan when they approached him with the idea to make this film.\n\nThough every D-Day veteran's story may not be the stuff of Hollywood hyperbole, the contribution these men made to history and our future deserves far greater care than has been exercised by the makers of this film. I respect this man for his contribution. I am sorry his story was delivered by people incapable to telling it with the professionalism and care it deserved.",
