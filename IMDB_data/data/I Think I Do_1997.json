I have had straight and gay friends equally enjoy it. The best thing about it is Tuc Watkins. His performance as the slightly dim soap star was excellent. Really, he truly deserved recognition for this fine supporting performance. The rest of the cast does great too--and the script is funny and sexy. Definitely recommended!",
