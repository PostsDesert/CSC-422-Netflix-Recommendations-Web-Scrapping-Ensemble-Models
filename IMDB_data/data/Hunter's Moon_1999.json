        "reviewBody": "After 15 episodes of Al Simmons endless whining and complaining, we finally get some action. I never read the comic books, and if they were as boring as this cartoon, I am glad I never did. Add in the two minutes of Todd McFarlane trying to be Rod Serling at the beginning of every episode, and it gets ponderous. Thanks to Covid-19 Shelter in Place, I had nothing better to do, so I binge watched Spawn.\n\nFor the first time in the series, a supernatural creature bursts into Al Simmons's world, and she is a vampire and a bounty hunter. It does not make much sense that Heaven would hire a damned creature such as a vampire, but after 15 episodes of nothing, I am willing to roll with it. She is a lot more interesting than Al Simmons.\n\nThere is finally some action, and Spawn gets the fight of his life against someone that can go toe-to-toe with him. Honestly, as a superhero, Spawn is pretty weak and lame. Robin or Aqualad could kick his butt.",
