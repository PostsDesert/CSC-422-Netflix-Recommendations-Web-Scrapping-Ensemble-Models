Fact is, this really should be higher on the list of the most iconic science fiction of the early years. The effects are marvelous, and it's some of Harryhausen's best work in my opinion. Awesome concept, an alien race eager to learn about the humans, what their planet is like, only to become paranoid at the idea of violent humans coming to the moon. It's a bit different from most films of its time in the fact that the alien race isn't exactly the enemy of the humans. They are more so concerned and ready to defend themselves from an oncoming invasion...to the moon, from earth. Overall I could totally watch this film again, which is something I don't usually do. I would highly recommend it to anyone who truly loves science fiction.",
