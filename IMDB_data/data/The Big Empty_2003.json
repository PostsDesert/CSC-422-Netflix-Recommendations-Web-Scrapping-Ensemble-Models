A man lost in desperation over money debt is given an offer to take a blue suitcase to the middle of the \"Big Empty\", (meaning desert) and in return receive his lifetime debts paid off. Along the way of course, are crazy characters to dot the landscape and create drama,and,in general stand in the way of this very simple deal to get rich quick or quirk in this very fanciful sci-fi send up(it may even be quark). While waiting to find out what is IN this blue suitcase, his neighbor is killed and his head put into a bowling bag, his favorite girl kidnapped and ransomed for same and the young life of Ruthie (played excellently by Rachel Leigh Cook) hangs in the balance due to bad dating standards. All in all, a very satisfying movie if you like strange. Remember, WE ARE NOT ALONE!",
