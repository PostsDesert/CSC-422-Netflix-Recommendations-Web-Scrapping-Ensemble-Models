        "reviewBody": "Nicole Kidman's breakthrough film, indie director Gus Van Sant's tragic-comic tale of Suzanne Stone (Nicole Kidman) a fame obsessed housewife who seduces three teenagers to get rid of her husband (Matt Dillon.) To Die For is directed in a pseudo-documentary style with some of the characters telling their story to the camera. Writer Buck Henry seems to be commenting on the superficiality of TV personalities, weather forecasters and talk show hosts with his references to Geraldo Rivera and Maury Povich and Suzanne's obsessive desire to be on TV.\n\nThe acting is outstanding from everyone. Nicole Kidman is the perfect choice for the seductress whose emotional age seems to be about ten years old and gives new meaning to the word \"superficial.\" Joaquin Phoenix shows evidence of the star he would become. Alison Folland and Illeana Douglas are excellent.\n\nI'm an admitted Nicole Kidman fan and this film shows her talent. She's also a gorgeous woman. Recommended."
