There's a plot involving gambling and money and murder, but it's pretty ignorable.\n\nThe music is almost overpoweringly awful (and loud); it's hard to hear the actors over it at times, and it really detracts from the sex scenes.\n\nThe sex ranges from lackluster soft core that doesn't really go anywhere to girl-on-girl scenes that are interrupted almost as soon as they start, to shower scenes in which things are so foggy, you can't see a darn thing. The girls aren't too unattractive, but little is done with them and it's all incredibly fake.",
