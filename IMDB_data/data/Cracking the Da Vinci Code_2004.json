This documentary takes you to all the places mentioned in the book and bores the living daylights out of you. I didn't want to hear authors blabbing on about the whole controversy. It's getting annoying. The Worst Part of this Documentary will definitely have to be the expert interviews. I always had to fast-forward past them because i wanted to remain alive after the documentary ended. Simon Ocx has done a poor performance with this and i don't know why i spent $30 on the DVD when i will never watch the stupid thing again.\n\nThe Only Good Part is seeing the paintings and the buildings. I don't care about what experts say.",
