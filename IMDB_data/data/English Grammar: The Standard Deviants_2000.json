        "reviewBody": "As with all the Standard Deviants instructional videos, the presentation is condescending and annoying. The information is good, but all the stupid jokes and attitudes of the people in it makes the movie seem likes its for little kids. Perhaps they are for little kids, but even the high school videos are presented as if they are for 3rd graders. I have never figured out why the standard deviants videos are all presented in this manner, they would be much more effective if they just cut the crap and just gave you useful instructional information. I guess if you can put up with all the nonsense and don't mind being talked to as if you are a moron or a little kid, then you might get something out of this.",
