Drea (who's black) shows up with her group at the 2nd tribal and sees 2 black players sitting in the jury box and she basically has a meltdown that turns into a big scene because she thinks that the first 2 people to be voted off being black was so racial. Only problem is, though they were the first 2 in the jury, they were NOT the first 2 to be voted off! The first ones to be voted off were as follows: voted off Survivor 42 in Week 6? - Lydia Meredith - White voted off Survivor 42 in Week 5? - -Daniel Strunk - White Week 4? - Swati Goel - Black?\n\nWeek 3 - Jenny Kim - Asian Week 2 - Marya Sherron - Brown Week 1 - Zach Wurtenberger - White\n\nBut once again Jeff wimps out and goes PC and says nothing about this, and neither does anyone else! Unbelievable!\n\n'nuff said!",
