The tony, elderly\n\nWestwood audience I saw HORSES with seemed put out that such an unpleasant experience interrupted their usual\n\nflow of Landmark Cinema Cultural Time-Outs; those with\n\nstronger constitutions will be offered as compensation\n\nimages that will stay seared in your heart for the rest of your\n\nlife.\n\nA scene in the snow, in which an extended family decides\n\nthe fate of the dwarfish younger brother, has an operatic\n\nseverity that suggests a closer approximation of the dramatic quality of the Old Testament than any movie based on the Bible. The ending is so amazingly courageous one cannot imagine a brace of dentist-investors, much less an American studio, standing\n\nfor its effrontery. \n\nThe Iranian cinema is not just reinventing the experience of\n\nmovies; it is rediscovering the moral dimension of telling\n\nstories."
