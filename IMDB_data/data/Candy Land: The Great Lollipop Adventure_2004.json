I love every single character, with the exception of Lord Licorice. There are many important lessons in this movie such as: Being on time.\n\nHelping others when they are in need.\n\nBeing kind and friendly.\n\nDoing what is expected of you.\n\nBeing responsible.\n\nI have the game and a puzzle of it as well. This was a great idea for a movie. Destined to be a classic. Kudos to the cast, crew and filmmakers. Two Thumbs Way Up!",
