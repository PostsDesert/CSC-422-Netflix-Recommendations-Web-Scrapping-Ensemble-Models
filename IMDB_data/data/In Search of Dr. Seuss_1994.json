After I watched it, however, I was enlightened by the mind-numbing amount of information about the \"Good Doctor\", from his early years to the present. The movie is well written (though the background design are rather cheesy and the film looks like it's colored in \"Technicolor\"), performed and directed. Whether you're a bookworm, Dr. Seuss fan, a college student doing a research on Dr. Seuss, or just plain couch potato, this movie's one you cannot miss! I give it 2 thumbs up!"
