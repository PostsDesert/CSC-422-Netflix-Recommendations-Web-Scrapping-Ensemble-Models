        "reviewBody": "The deranged military and former CIA agent Dean Cage (Wesley Snipes) is in a rehab program, trying to forget the traumatic loss of his best friend Scott in Bosnia. When he dates with his girl-friend and Scott's sister, Detective Amy knight (Jacqueline Obradors), in a dinning restaurant, he is mistakenly taken as being the CIA agent that is investigating the robbery of the military experiment EX by a man called Sullivan (Stuart Wilson). He is injected with the drug and abducted by the thieves. Amy has six hours to find the also stolen antidote and save Dean's life.\n\n\"Unstoppable\" is a movie with an absurd and awful screenplay. The story has so many flaws and ridiculous situations that become amazing how an actor like Wesley Snipes accepts to participate of such a crap. The \"hero\" jumps through a window in an asylum, in front of the police cars, and nobody cares. There are lots of shots inside the hospital and nobody hears. The drugged \"hero\", with cloudy vision, kills the men in the helicopter with precise shoots, while the place is surrounded by FBI agents that do nothing. I could spend the afternoon listing holes in this flick. The cast is also awful and miscast: for example, the Caucasian Jacqueline Obradors, with her horrible tone of voice, has no chemistry with Wesley Snipes. I believe that even in a rainy and cold Saturday afternoon this movie does not work. My vote is three.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Fugindo do Passado\" (\"Escaping from the Past\")",
