There's no alien invaders, no demons, no ghosts, no monsters. Only themselves. There's no gratuitous nudity, no fanservice, no sexual innuendo, no awkward teen hero.\n\nWe are given one Miss Tsukiko Sagi, creator of Moromi, a popular dog character that everyone loves and has merchandise of in one form or another (think Hello Kitty). One night walking home, she is attacked by an unknown assailant, to be forever known as Lil Slugger, a boy on rollerblades with a baseball bat.\n\nSo begins a series that will make your eyes bug out and go \"Huh!? I don't get it?!\" Don't worry, its like that. Its a great 13 episodes with an emotional and powerful climax thats a metaphor for life itself.\n\nA MUST SEE for anyone in general, even if you don't like anime, this is a masterpiece."
