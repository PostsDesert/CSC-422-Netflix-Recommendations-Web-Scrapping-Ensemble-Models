        "reviewBody": "Timothy \"Speed\" Levitch is a fascinating character, a modern beat poet demonstrating how happy Lou Reed and Bob Dylan would be if married. In \"Shiva,\" he demonstrates his always awesome command of the language, his erudition and his apparent love of life, words and New York City. The only problem for the viewers is that we are not all in love with New York City. Speed find in his city a metaphor for everything. The city is a microcosm with all our philosophies, beliefs, desires, emotions and foibles reflected in its statuary, its design, its history. He could be right, and he argues his case very well.\n\nNot to suggest that New York City is that black hole crime-ridden evil-folk cesspool it's thought of in some circles, but it's just not for all of us. I'm kind of partial to Philly myself. This movie is a poetic, philosophic 23 minute rant that works beautifully, and I highly recommend it. I hope that Speed's focus broadens to match his intellect...or, at the very least, he falls in love with Philly.",
