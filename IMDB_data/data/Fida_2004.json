But back to fida, its an interesting love/hate story first half sets the mood but all the action is in the second half as fardeen khan makes his entrance. Overall i would recommend watching this movie an interesting one timer, the pace is never disrupted either, not even by the songs which i have to mention are good but il let everyone find out the 2 and a half hour way.\n\nEnjoy!!",
