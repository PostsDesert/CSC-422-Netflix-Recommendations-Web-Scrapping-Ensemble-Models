        "reviewBody": "Sure, it's for kids, but I'm no kid...well maybe an over=grown one or a kid at heart. Anyway, I liked this because the dogs were well characterized as individuals albeit stereotyped ones. The animation is standard and while nothing outstanding, it's sure adequate.James Earl Jones of course added his own sympathetic tones to the narration. It has a reasonably complicated enough plot for those at all age levels, so even if you're adult and feel silly watching something like this, grab a kid and watch it with him or her..he or she will love it and especially if you're a dog lover, you'll like it too, whether you want to admit it or not. Ho, ho, ho!"
