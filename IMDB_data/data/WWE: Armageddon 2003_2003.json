There were a few nice surprises that sprung from the fact that I wasn't expecting very much at all.\n\nIf there's any reason to check it out, it's the main event. Not only was Brock Lesnar -vs- Big Show more entertaining than it had any right to be, it was actually entertaining by more general standards. The ending totally rules. The ladder match was messy, but it has enough 'WHOA!' spots to make if worthwhile. That's all though. Everything else was pretty much 'meh'."
