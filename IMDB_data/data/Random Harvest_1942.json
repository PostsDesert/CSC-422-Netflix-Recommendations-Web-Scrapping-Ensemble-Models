        "reviewBody": "...I rented this and now I'd like to own it. It's just plain wonderful.\n\nDespite being endowed with a story by the redoubtable James Hilton, this film is carried by the sheer power of its two stars. Colman (as Smithy/Rainier) and Garson (as Paula/Margaret) are at their luminous best. While the story can seem a bit implausible with too much thought, it is presented with such great truth, sincerity, and momentum that the viewer is swept along effortlessly.\n\nLike other Hilton books and their associated film translations (such as Lost Horizon and Goodbye, Mr. Chips), this movie has an exceptionally memorable and satisfying ending. I wanted to watch the ending over and over, but I'm glad that I resisted in this case - it helped me to retain the film in perspective.\n\nThe sad note is Susan Peters, who does a great job of essaying Rainier's young admirer. Peters was paralyzed in a hunting accident not long after this film, and her career and personal life never recovered.\n\nIf you've seen and liked the other Hilton adaptations mentioned above, as well as films such as Mrs. Miniver and The Talk of the Town, then you should not miss this. Close to a 10/10.",
