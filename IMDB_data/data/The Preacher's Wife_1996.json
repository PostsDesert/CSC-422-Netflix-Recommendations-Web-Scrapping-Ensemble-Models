You can just see them sitting around the conference table talking about adding color and, oh, yeah, lets make the characters black! It would be OK if they really tried to do it better. But they are really just trying to cash in.\n\nSuch is the case with \"The Preacher's Wife\". A modernized color version of the Cary Grant vehicle, \"The Bishop's Wife\", the insertion of even this excellent black cast does nothing to enhance the story.\n\nDenzel never seems to capture the sly charm of Dudley, the angel sent to help the Preacher. Now we know Denzel can be a charmer, but even he cannot deliver through this tired direction and uninspired script. Nothing really works in the movie (unless, perhaps, you never saw the original), the Preacher is not sympathetic enough, Whitney isn't at full strength as the title character, and even Gregory Hines can't seem to make the villain seem like much of a baddie.\n\nA thorough waste of time and celluloid!"
