        "reviewBody": "This one of three DVD's (currently) which show various works (usually music videos, commercials and/or shorts) by the director, Chris Cunningham. The other two showcase directors Michel Gondry and Spike Jonez.\n\nChris Cunningham's style is very different from Gondry. His style has more sexual ambiguity, much darker, more violent, more inclusive of technology and a general sense of strangeness and/or creepiness. For example, in Aphex Twins - Come to Daddy, the Nosferatu type characters or in windowlicker, all the women have the same male face (creepy smile and bearded) and the creepy-smile, pony-tail, bearded guy who loves to dance.\n\nMy favorite video on the DVD is by far the Bjork video (all is full of love). I love the concept of robots making out. If they are made to simulate human movement, why not take it further.\n\nI highly recommend this DVD along with the others in the series.\n\n-Celluloid Rehab",
