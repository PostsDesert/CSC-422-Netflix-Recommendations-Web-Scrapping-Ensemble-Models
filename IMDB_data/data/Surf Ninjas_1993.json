It is one of the most hysterical movies I have ever watched.\n\nI saw it first when I was about 10 because my little brother was on a ninja movies kick. I think I liked it better than he did. Of course, back then I thought Johnny was cute. \n\nI'm quite a lot older now, and this movie still makes me laugh as I hard today as I did then. As pathetic as this movie is, it has to be my favorite. \n\nI think everyone on the planet should see this movie at least a dozen times. It's not a cinematic masterpiece, but it's worth every minute.",
