        "reviewBody": "Christina Aguilera is my all time favourite singer with an unbelievable voice and this is the perfect DVD to prove it. Not only is she singing the songs that made her famous but she sings completely live throughout all and when you here someone sing live, thats when you know how great they are, you get the genuine article right there in front of you with nothing but their own voice to fall back on. Her vocal range is shined right out of the arena, her power boomed through the room and the entire thing was focused on her singing. I don't think there is much point doing a performance and speaking through most of it or lip-syncing or wearing as little as you possibly can just so that the audience will stay. However, Christina did none of this, she spoke to the audience with true heartfelt words, and although she wore sexy clothes that emphasised how great she looked, the show was never steered away from her singing, which as said many times was truly phenomenal. With great guest appearance with the exception maybe of Lil' Bow Wow and short breaks to view Christina behind the scenes footage, Its an amazing show for all fans of great work.",
