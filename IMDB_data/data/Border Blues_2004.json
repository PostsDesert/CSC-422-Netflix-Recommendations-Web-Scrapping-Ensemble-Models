This movie was pretty good, the acting was more than acceptable and very good for some characters, the plot was acceptable and I enjoyed this movie and I'm happy that I didn't listen to the reviewers. If I did that I would miss a movie that, in the end, I really liked.\n\nInteresting that some characters spoke in Russian and others in Spanish, I mean they spoke in their mother languages and I liked that too.\n\nThere are a lot of movies out there and so bad that I can't believe that someone would be able to watch them and many times they got a better score than this... that means that unfortunately the honesty has gone and someone is paid to write good and bad reviews.\n\nVery sad, many people don't have any more a conscience, they just think of money, that time has gone forever, it's time to be better people, not worse.\n\nGive a try to this movie, maybe you'll like it.",
