        "reviewBody": "Tomorrow is one of the finest movies I have seen. Duvall was excellent in this movie, and even he points back to this as his finest work in cinema (I read an article once in which Duvall said that this role was his \"King Lear\"). The story is simple but significant. The impact of it is substantial. It is not a movie for hard-hearted cynics. Although it is not sappy, and by no means is it over-the-top (understated is a much better description), the movie does require a man to peel back his macho veneer and and try to identify with a life situation many men may find almost ridiculous (or horrifying) in this day, i.e. a life of faithful love and service. As such, this film would not be a top pick of fans of \"The Man Show\", or anything on MTV, for that matter. It is a gutwrenching story of sacrifice and self-denial; in other words, it is a REAL love story that brings to mind the love of God for the unlovely."
