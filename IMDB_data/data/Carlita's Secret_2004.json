The editing and the choosing of rap music in this Latino film killed the movie for me. I have seen other films that the director has made and I can only say for sure that he was not involved in the editing of this movie. The acting was good and it had some good camera work. The quality of the sound was poor, I couldn't understand some of the dialog do to the rap music been to loud. I think the movie should have been scored.\n\nI gave a vote of 7 out of 10 for the good acting and direction. But I give a vote of 1 for awful editing and producing.",
