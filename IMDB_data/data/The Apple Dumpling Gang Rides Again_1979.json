        "reviewBody": "Good again.\n\nLike the first film, 'The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again' manages to suitably entertain. I still don't think Theodore (Don Knotts) and Amos (Tim Conway) are majorly funny, but it is enjoyable to see their shenanigans - especially amid well-known crooks.\n\nThose two are about the same as they are in the 1975 original, but the side story in this isn't interesting at all - the love stuff with Jeff (Tim Matheson) and Milly (Elyssa Davalos) is very forced. Harry Morgan, playing a different character than in the other, isn't as good this time. All the villains, though not amazing, are all very solid in what they give.\n\n'The Apple Dumpling Gang' is the better of the two, but both are just about entertaining to watch thanks to Knotts and Conway.",
