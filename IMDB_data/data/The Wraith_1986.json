Since I had viewed it so much as a kid, it was like going back and watching a movie you almost know by heart but at the same time weren't really sure what was going to happen next.\n\nThe soundtrack was great, with the likes of Ozzy, Billy Idol, Robert Palmer and others. Looking at all that 80's \"fashion\" was fun too. The DVD box didn't say the year but I had determined it to be about '86 or '87.\n\nI couldn't help but draw a comparison to this storyline and that of \"The Crow\". \"The Crow\" is definitely a darker piece of fun but the same \"guy done wrong takes revenge and finds his girl\" wasn't hard to miss.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for something fun, with a great soundtrack, cool cars and fast car races, check it out!",
