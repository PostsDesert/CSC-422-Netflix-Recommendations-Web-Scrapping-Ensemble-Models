        "reviewBody": "Acceptable Frankenstein entry with colorful photography ,thrilling as well as chilling musical score by James Bernard and Peter Cushing , as ever , does a top notch performance in the role which made him a terror movie legend , it still stands as one of the great screen acting . Last of the Terence Fisher/Frankenstein films , this one deals with the Baron hiding out in a psychiatric institution and he , then , joins forces with another scientist who becomes his assistant . The latter is a young doctor who helped by a mortuary attendant and Bodysnatcher (Patrick Troughton ) took corpses from graveyards until being detained , accused of sorcery and condemned . In the insane asylum resides hidden the notorious Doctor Victor Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) who along with inmate Dr. Simon Helder (Shane Briant) , being attended by the dumb-mute Sarah (Madeline Smith , this character was first offered to Caroline Munro) carry out creepy experiments . Victor and Simon set about constructing a man using body parts they acquire for the purpose , including the brain of a prestigious scholar . Both of whom create a weird being and bring it to life . As his brain came from a genius and his body came from a killer and his soul came from hell . After successfully re-animating him , things go wrong . Frankenstein whose experimentation with creation of life becomes an obsession , but his creature behaves not as he intended . \n\nThe classic actor of horror movies named Peter Cushing is terrific as Frankenstein , giving a portentous performance , as always . Atmospheric , slick terror film , creaky at times but it's still impressive . This exciting film packs thrills , chills , eerie events and lots of gore and guts . In fact , real human blood was used in this film , blood that could no longer be used for transfusions was sourced from the blood bank and used in the film, including in the notorious scene where Victor Frankenstein uses his teeth to clamp the artery of the monster . Intelligent and twisted screenplay has nice plot , including fine production design , enhancing its atmosphere thanks to its brilliant color by expert cameraman Brian Probyn . The script by Anthony Hinds or John Elder was revised several times to avoid repeating any elements from the Universal Frankenstein series , as part of this effort, new monster make-up had to be devised especially for this film . After the successful Universal Pictures as ¨House of Frankestein¨, ¨Bride of Frankestein¨ , ¨Son of Frankestein¨, ¨Frankestein meet the wolf man¨ and ¨ The Zingara and the monsters¨ , Frankestein personage was left until Hammer Productions took him and produced ¨The curse of Frankenstein¨ ; although Universal threatened a lawsuit if Hammer copied any elements from the classic version . Followed by six sequels as ¨Revenge of Frankestein¨ by Fisher , ¨Evil of Frankestein¨ by Freddie Francis , Frankestein created woman¨ by Fisher , ¨Frankestein must be destroyed¨ by Fisher , ¨The horror of Frankestein¨ by Jimmy Sangster and this ¨Frankestein and the monster from hell¨ by Fisher ; all of them starred by Peter Cushing and one by Ralph Bates , besides similar artistic and technician team as the cameraman Jack Asher , Production designer Bernad Robinson , musician James Bernard and make-up by Philip Leaky .\n\nThis ¨Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell¨ results to be the last of Hammer's Frankenstein movies , being compellingly directed by Terence Fisher , though inferior to previous installments . This was the final film directed by Terence Fisher before his death on June 18, 1980 at the age of 76 . It was also the 29th and final Hammer film that he directed . The first was ¨The last page¨ (1952), he subsequently shot classic horror films as ¨Dracula¨, ¨Dracula , prince of darkness¨ , ¨The brides of Dracula¨ , ¨The mummy¨ , ¨Phantom of opera¨, ¨The Gorgon¨ , ¨The devil rides out¨ and many others . Rating : Passable terror film , 6/10 ; essential and indispensable watching for Peter Cushing fans .",
