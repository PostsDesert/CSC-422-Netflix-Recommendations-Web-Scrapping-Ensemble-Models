It deals directly with the issue of ones self worth and overcoming feelings of inadequacy.\n\nI buy these videos because of the animation and graphics but the stories have a message for people of all ages.\n\nThe graphics quality is excellent with very colourful art and excellent score. The bonus fetchers are well put together, although I had a problem with the pointer on some of the sub menus, but was able to access the information with some fiddling.\n\nGo and buy this one.\n\nOh, there is also a bonus story after the credits from an old Veggie tales story.",
