        "reviewBody": "This film is about two hit men that are assigned to do a number of jobs, but meanwhile realize that the lives they lead are not the lives they always wanted to have. They want to quit murdering and start a less complicated life.\n\nThe on itself not even extremely boring plot line is carried out horribly. The intention to create a dynamic duo a la Vincent Vega and Jules Winfield of Van Dien and Fox fails completely because of the worthless dialogues. This fact on itself dominates the unpleasant character of the film and thus makes the end result to a complete disaster. The acting performances are truly horrible, but it must be said, that is not so much because of Van Dien or Fox but more because of the emptiness of the characters they must enroll. \n\nThis film was total crap and I wonder what more I could've done in the 90 minutes of my life I spent watching it. My god...everything would be more satisfying then watching The Collectors. It is a miracle how this production raised the small amount of money that was needed for producing this film.",
