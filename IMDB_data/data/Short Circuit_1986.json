        "reviewBody": "Short Circuit is a rare case when a robot character makes a film and outshines the rest of the cast in the film.\n\nA military organization that builds weapons known as Nova creates five robots. One of the robots, Number Five, is hit by lightning and as a result is able to become \"alive\". He escapes from Nova and befriends a woman named Stephanie and begins to gain a lot of \"input\" and learns a lot. Nova plans on capturing him, but Number Five realizes that he must not get captured in order to remain alive.\n\nFirst off I have to say that this film is a comedy and much of it should not be taken seriously. By that I mean that the depiction of the military group of Nova constantly bickering and having lame discussions is something that film intended on doing.\n\nThe acting and human characters are pretty odd in this film. I can see why Steve Guttenberg is constantly criticized by viewers. He is just a boring not funny guy who makes robots in this film. Ally Sheed plays Stephanie, a really naive and not that intelligent veterinarian. Also the character of Ben being a Caucasian who speaks like an Indian Person is something that I think is pretty funny, if not a bit racist as well. But for the most part the human characters are not special at all and completely overshadowed.\n\nThey attempt to make a love story with Guttenberg and Sheed's character. However it comes off as rushed and horrible and I did not buy it. If anything the romance with Number five and Stephanie is much more convincable.\n\nThe reason for this film being good is Number Five. Number Five is one of the greatest robot characters ever in a film. Hilarious, intelligent, and highly entertaining. He can do anything. It is quite interesting seeing him gain input and learn a lot about the world. It is not common for a robot to steal the show and make a movie good just by itself, but this is one case where that happens and the film is good because of it.\n\nQuite an interesting film. Lame acting and human characters. However a great character in Number Five. I recommend this film to viewers because of Number Five.",
