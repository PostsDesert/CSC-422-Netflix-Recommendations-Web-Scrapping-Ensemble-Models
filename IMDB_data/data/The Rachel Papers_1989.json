        "reviewBody": "Despite some fine performances and great source material, this movie doesn't stand up as well as I'd hoped it would. It's either too dark and serious for the comedy it hopes to be or it's too gauzy for the serious look at modern teenagers in Britain that it hopes to be.\n\nStill, it's interesting to see Dexter \"did you know I was in Bugsy Malone AND Lock, Stock & 2 Smoking Barrells\" Fletcher, Ione \"wow, am I really this naked in this movie\" Skye, Jonathon \"why aren't I working more often?\" Pryce and James \"didn't I play this same character only with more lines in Pretty in Pink\" Spader in a movie that hardly any American has ever heard of...\n\nThis has its clever moments, its funny moments, its heartbreaking moments and a few moments that are meant to be (and are) disturbing... It's not as clever as its American cousin, or as funny...but it does have a bit more depth...and Ione Skye is REALLY naked in it.\n\nThat's worth a rental, isn't it?",
