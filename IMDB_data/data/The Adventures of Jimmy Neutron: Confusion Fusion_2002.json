        "reviewBody": "This was not the best show on Nickelodean- Angry Beavers(the best), Rugrats, Spongebob Squarepants(before it jumped the shark) and Wild Thornberrys are better- but it is not the worst, it is way better than ChalkZone, iCarly and I think Fairly Odd Parents too. That is not to say Jimmy Neutron has its problems, it can be cheesy and predictable in some of the story lines, with some annoying side characters and some uneven pacing.\n\nHowever, the CGI animation is not bad at all, the colours and backgrounds are imaginative, the gadgets were incredible and the characters are well-modelled. The music is also tolerable, while the writing is witty and funny, yes with cheesy moments(I don't know where the evil pants idea came from), but it was funny and the stories while predictable had some clever and original parts to them. The characters are in general good, Jimmy's parents and Carl can be annoying, but I like how Jimmy is loyal and inventive and how sassy Cindy is, and out of the villains I loved Professor Calamitus. And the voice acting is excellent from all involved.\n\nOverall, don't expect a masterpiece of a show but one that's fun and witty. Oh, and if you like the show, you may like the movie. 7/10 Bethany Cox",
