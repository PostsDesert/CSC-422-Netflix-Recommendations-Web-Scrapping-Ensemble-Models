Well Year -1970 Movie - Mere Humsafar.. only difference here is in the old movie the director played by non other but Balraj Sahini has his eye on the lady and woes to win her, make her career etc., while the poor village boy (Jeetendra) almost looses her to the film world & glamor..\n\nPlot very similar and identical..\n\nIncidentally there is another Aamir Khan movie again inspired by an old blockbuster movie of 1971 and that's Caravan again starring Jeetendra, and the movie is \"Mela\", but that attempt was a failure, as the Original was too good."
