        "reviewBody": "Graceland is a fantastic album. I guess it's frontloaded, given its first eight songs are all great, and then its last three songs aren't bad... but are nevertheless the weakest songs on the album. I was excited to watch this live performance, but wish it had been the whole album played live and in order, with maybe some of the other songs added to the end or the beginning. It might be a weird complaint, but I feel like the flow of it all would've been better that way.\n\nStill, it was a nice (and novel) way to listen to a familiar album, reinterpreted and changed up here and there for the purpose of playing it live. Enjoyed most of the guest musicians, too, and it stands out from many other concert films of its time by taking place in Africa, and occasionally having some interesting cutaways.",
