        "reviewBody": "I highly suggest this movie, even if you are not a Patsy Cline fan. It is the touching story of Patsy's life, how she rose to success, and the struggles she encountered along the way.\n\nHer story and songs are sure to touch anyone's heart because there is such feeling behind them. Jessica Lange and Ed Harris do a remarkable job portraying Patsy and her husband, Charlie. The on-screen magic makes you believe you are in the late 50's/early 60's watching the couple for yourself.\n\nRun to the video store and check out this one tonight! You won't regret it."
