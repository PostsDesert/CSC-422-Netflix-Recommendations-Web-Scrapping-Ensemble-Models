        "reviewBody": "Even though this is good music from a young man who knows how to sing, this DVD was disappointing. For some odd reason, Groban's voice has a distinct nasal sound on some of his notes he sings in this concert. It's definitely noticeable and annoying because he doesn't sound like that on any of his CDs.\n\nThat, and the shrieking girls between songs, are two negatives that made me regret paying big bucks for this concert package. I should have just stuck with the CD of his work.\n\nOne of the musicians shown here is a very young violin player. She gets a solo of her own, which she handles nicely. Groban is also more outgoing than normal, kidding with the crowd between songs (evoking more shrieks from the bimbos) and looking very relaxed and confident.",
