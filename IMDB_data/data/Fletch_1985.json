Although Chase gets more mileage out of it because of the laughs, it's an intriguing character in all respects.\n\nMichael Ritchie directs nicely and the supporting cast works well, particularly Libertini as Fletch's noisy and brassy editor in chief. This is a film that is filled with more classic one liners than any film in the 1980's. It's one that makes us miss the old Chase and wonder why he's planning to make yet another \"Vacation\" movie.\n\nWe miss you, Chevy!",
