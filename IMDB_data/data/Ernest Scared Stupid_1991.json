I liked it then and I still like it now. It has a lot of laughs. It has a nice story with characters you care about. Its monsters are pretty scary/pretty gross. Jim Varney was one of kind. I wouldn't call him a comic genius but he comes pretty close. He created a character that is as warm as he is funny. Ernest P. Worrell is always a welcome watch in my house.",
