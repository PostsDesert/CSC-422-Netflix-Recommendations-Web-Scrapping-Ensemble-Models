While the subject matter is a little more risque than most teen movies from the era, it is handled in a fun manner, and gets across a good message in the end. Well, okay, maybe it's not such a positive message, but it's still a lot of fun, and has a great supporting cast, including Carrie Fisher in her 6th best movie ever.",
