Each has won praise from critics, and each has contributed to the look and style of the genre.\n\n&apos;Knocked Out; Paula&apos;s first video, her first starring role on film has been re-edited specifically for inclusion in this collection.\n\nFor the four clips that follow - &apos;(It&apos;s Just) The Way That You Love Me&apos;, &apos;Straight Up&apos;, &apos;Forever Your Girl&apos; and &apos;Cold Hearted&apos; - Paula collaborated with award-winning director David Fincher.\n\nTogether, they created a succession of immensely popular and provocative works. Both won recognition in September of 1989 when Paula and &apos;Straight Up&apos; gathered four prestigious MTV video music awards - for Best Female Artist, Dance Video, Editing and Choreography.\n\nViewed together these five videos represent a body of work unmatched by any other artist. Drawn from just one album, they establish Paula Abdul as popular music&apos;s foremost video star.\"},\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating",
