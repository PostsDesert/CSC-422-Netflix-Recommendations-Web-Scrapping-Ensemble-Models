Even so, the movie is an impressive piece of work, with Fernando Luján as the war veteran who keeps expecting his pension.\n\nThis is the first Arturo Ripstein movie that I've seen. I hope to see more of his work, and I hope to read more of Gabriel García Márquez's work (I've only read \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\").\n\nThe plot's subtlety and the complex characters amount to a great story. Definitely see it.",
