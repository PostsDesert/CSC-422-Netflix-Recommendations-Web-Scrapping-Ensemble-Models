        "reviewBody": "I thought this film was okay once the director decided not to go for outright comedy and tell a story. Hairshow is not a comedy I would call it light entertainment. When I watched the opening scene that had Monique putting salt in her coffee I thought to myself that if this is all they can do for comedy then this film is going to be a disaster. The will reading scene did make me laugh but from then on it was just light entertainment. I loved both the leading actresses Monique and Kellita Smith and I have a soft spot for Gina Torres being a 'Firefly' fan. The film had standard situations, sibling rivalry, competition with another hair salon and a tangled love life and off course a competition. Who will win? Anyway I liked hair show, would not buy unless I found it at a knockdown low price but I liked it. The only thing I could not get my head around was the leading mans choice of woman, but to each his own.",
