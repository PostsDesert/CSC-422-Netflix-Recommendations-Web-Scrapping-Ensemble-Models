        "reviewBody": "This is without doubt the funniest Animé I have seen, and quite possibly the funniest thing, I'm sure nothing has made me laugh so much! Everything in it is funny, there's not a second goes past without something to make you laugh, and it manages to maintain a cohesive if somewhat surreal plot under it all too. And as for the ending music... I've had it playing when I open Windows since I first saw it a year or two ago and it still makes me laugh! And, as I think everyone else had said, Dug Finn's realisation that he's been cut out of the first episode... unparalleled, that made me so hard and long I missed the end.\n\nOne thing I would say though, usually I sit on the fence in the big subs/dubs debate, I really don't mind either for the most part, but if you're going to buy DragonHalf go for the Subbed version if you have the choice, the Japanese voices just suit the comedy so much more. I first saw the subbed and when I finally found it again and bought it I was disappointed to find that I had the dubbed version, and that the dubbed was so distinctly inferior. Not to say the dubbed is bad, but it misses a couple of jokes (like Damaramu's one step, two rank, three meal pun) and the subbed is just that much better it's worth the effort of reading!\n\nEven if you don't like animé, watch it. It might seem a bit weird, but if you give it a chance it'll have you rolling in the aisles, it may even convert you."
