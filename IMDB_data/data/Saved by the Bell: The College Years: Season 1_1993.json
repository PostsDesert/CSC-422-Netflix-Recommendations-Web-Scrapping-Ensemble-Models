I practically counted the days until the series premiere, and I truly enjoyed the few episodes that aired. It was canceled not because it was a bad show, I think, but because the truth is that lighthearted shows like \"Saved by the Bell\" just do not belong in a competitive prime time environment. This show was ridiculed just because, what, it was getting beat in the ratings by \"Full House\"? Come on! Expectations were way too high. It would have been safe on Saturday mornings like the original, never mind that it was about college students. We fans would have watched regardless."
