        "reviewBody": "Green Plaid Shirt is a flawlessly conceived and executed gay love story made challenging by poor sound quality. It takes a lot of attention, audio adjustments, and frequent rewinds to understand everything that's said, but it is WELL worth the trouble. People who aren't willing to invest such time and energy will understandably hate this movie, but those who are willing to will be greatly rewarded.\n\nIt's probably the most beautifully moving and believable love story I have ever seen anywhere. Besides the sound, everything about this movie—writing, direction, acting, editing, photography—is absolutely perfect and astonishing. The story line is not chronologically linear, but it's perfectly fitted to the development of this particular story and makes it easier to follow than if it WERE chronological.\n\nThis is no fairy tale romance. There are failures, betrayals, stupidity, selfishness and much sadness along the way, but that's how life is. Learning to love another person THROUGH troubles like that is the greatest good available to us as human beings, and that is exactly what this movie is about.\n\nTwo of the supporting characters (Jerry and Devon) are so self-centered and obnoxious I was relieved any time they were out of the story, but even they are entirely realistic, believable and very well-acted. Everybody else—including Phil's mother, who's on for only a couple of minutes—is simply perfect. Others have rightly commended Gregory Phelan and Kevin Spirtas in the leads; I'll add Jonathan Klein as Todd, one of the most original, appealing, and fascinating characters who ever appeared in any movie.\n\nI have never recommended a movie as highly as I recommend Green Plaid Shirt, to anybody who is willing to invest some of him(or her)self in watching it."
