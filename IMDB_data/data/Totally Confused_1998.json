        "reviewBody": "That the writer is inspired by Woody Allen here pretty obvious. With all its slightly off-kilter characters, the story is typically Allen too, except that it's Chicago instead of New York here. Since the writer is also one of the lead actors, he manages a Woody Allenesque dialog delivery. And I think he pulls it off quite well. I love that bit where he describes the sex he's having with his childhood buddy as \"male bonding...of a more advanced kind\". The gay thing is central to the film, but I liked the other parts too (these days nobody seems to make a wholly gay film. it's considered retrograde). The other story line about this pathological-liar agent convincing our untalented hero his music CD being distributed in Greenland is SO funny. I got this film off an American friend of mine visiting India and I liked it a lot. Wish more people might get to see it.",
