        "reviewBody": "I hope the people who made this movies read these comments. The choreography was horrid, the plot was nill, and the actors where so low budget power rangers appears 5 star to this junk.\n\nThe fight scenes where so slow you could actually see the actors waiting for each other to perform the next move. Camera cut-aways and poor lighting could not cover up the cheap effects. The lightning was just plain stupid. The weapons looked like something out of a final fantasy game, and the dual bow and arrow was just dull as anything I have ever seen.\n\nNext movie you decide to make try investing in some wireless mics, better script and try actually spending some time on your stunts.\n\nHonestly there are shows on t.v. that play ever night and are thrown together in a few hours that look better than this one.\n\nStick to martial arts (unless its as poor as your acting) then take up quilting.",
