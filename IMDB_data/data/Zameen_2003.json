        "reviewBody": "I am not a great fan of Abhishek but it was this movie that made me to start noticing him seriously. The main storyline is anti-terrorism keeping in line with success of movies like Pukaar, Gadar, Hero etc. \n\nThe main protagonist Abhishek shouldering a failed past is ACP Jai who has been assigned the mission to curb the terrorists and bring them to task. Joining him on this mission is his ex-boss Ajay Devgan in a smaller role as a head-strong and strict disciplinarian miming Al Pacino. He does not have a heroine (good - Bollywood is coming of age!). Bipasha plays Abhishek's love-interest and is Air-hostess by profession (reason: climax!).\n\nThe action scenes are a definite highlight and do match Hollywood standards.\n\nThe climax is inspired from Air-India hijacking episode and could have been enhanced if Die Hard 2 was made as a bench-mark. What about Abhishek - yes, he is definitely improving. He gives a restrained performance in scenes lamenting of his failed past (reminisces of BigB in Kala Patthar). And Kajol, please take a dentist appointment for your hubby.\n\nTaking into account that its directors debut movie, which is not too bad for a beginner and compared to the shoddy movies pouring in dozens, Zameen does have a few interesting points which make it watchable.\n\nVerdict: A poorly marketed movie which otherwise had good potential."
