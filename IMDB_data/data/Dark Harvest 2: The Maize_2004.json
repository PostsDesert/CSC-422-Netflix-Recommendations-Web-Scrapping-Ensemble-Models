How do independent film makers everywhere go years without getting noticed (or even their lives) and con-artists like the guy who made this get a DVD on a shelf? It seriously looks as if some guy with a home movie camera went out with some guys he met at Subway and made the worst thing he could think of.\n\n\"Hey guys, give me some ideas. Start with a corn-field and work backwards.\" \"Well, you've gotta have actors straight out of high school, and some broken corn stalks with shreds of clothing attached. And boobs.\" Thanks, guy, I'm sure that you and Windows Movie Maker will be side by side on your next anxiously awaited project."
