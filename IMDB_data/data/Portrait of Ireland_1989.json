        "reviewBody": "Beautifully filmed aerial sequences of the Irish countryside with popular Irish bands playing in the background. Looks like it is filmed from a helicopter but the credits confirm it is a fixed wing Cessna aircraft. Music from Enya and the Chieftans provide very pleasant sounds to the amazing sights of Ireland. I used to play it in my store to sell television sets. The copy I had was on laser disc but I would love to find it on DVD. The shots of the Isles of Arran remind one of Craggy Isle in the show Father Ted. Includes shots of the Giants causeway and other natural phenomenon as well as depicting the people and the cities of Ireland.",
