        "reviewBody": "David put together a fabulous tour band and knocked us all out with the best \"vocal performance\" of his career. The filming of the show is outstanding and the sound is superb, so be prepared to crank it up and have fun. We were so impressed by his vocals on this time out of the gate that we compared it with playback from \"CDs\", with-out a doubt the mans voice is better than at anytime in his career. David has traditionally enjoyed his time in front of his fans. This film captures the enjoyment that he has, watching us enjoying him. As a performer and a mature rock artist he really has a great list of tunes that he put together for the tour and the film. If you do not own a David Bowie music film and you only have a desire to purchase one, this is the film to get for the variety of tunes and the quality of the vocals. If you missed this tour and have not been following David Bowie recently there are enough new songs with the old stand-bys to bring you back up to date. A lot of fun and a great addition to any rock film collection.",
