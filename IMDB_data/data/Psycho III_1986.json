        "reviewBody": "I'm not lying, appart from Psycho IV (The concept had died out by then) this is the most underrated Psycho film. And, no matter what anyone says, if you like either Psycho or 1980's horror flix, you should like this. Perkins revises his role and the supporting cast help him along in his ageing role as geeky motel-man \"Stormin'\" Norman Bates. Mother takes on an even more horrific theme and the madness of Perkins is far more obvious. Perkins directs well and reveals things in a very Hitchcock style, and, even though the Hitch sertainly would NOT approve of this film, I liked it. The comedy ellement is combined with the horror. The spoof of the shower scene left me rolling on the floor (if you can laugh at that sort of thing!). The main problem is the high rating of the film (R in the States and 18 in Britain). The Hitch went through his career taking care of what he showed people, and by this stage in the Bates saga, it was just a see all know all knife flick. 7.5/10 (Not as good as Psycho II) Rated R. Contains scenes of a Sexual Nature, Nudity, Swearing and scenes that some viewers may find disturbing."
