        "reviewBody": "Before the famous 1989 comedy special The Diceman Cometh, Andrew Dice Clay wasn't as famous as he was then or now. But this proves that he was funny back then. Only problem, it seems as if this special is just The Diceman cometh as a experiment. But still, it is great (and funny) entertainment where we would first hear the mother goose poems and impressions (instead of Eric Roberts he does Jerry lewis). Great material, very topical, that shaped diec's career as a comedian. A+",
