        "reviewBody": "For the record this is the story of the mask which was created by Loki, who after many centuries tries to find it again, only to have it fall into the hands of an animator and his infant son.\n\nThis film raises several interesting questions, first and foremost is why is Jaime Kennedy a star when he has no talent what so ever? Based on this film he is talentless \"actor\" with no charisma. It maybe the film, but he's so uninteresting as to make watching this a chore. I'm certain that Alan Cumming, Bob Hoskins and Steven Wright were doing this for a pay check, but at least they turned in something approximating a performance. Kennedy walks through this film like a slacker...\n\nThen again considering the way the film turned out I'm convinced that most of the production staff were slackers.\n\nThe special effects aren't special. For a \"big budget\" Hollywood film the effects feel unfinished and video game like. They do not approximate real, even cartoon real. Its as if the producers decided that they had reached the level of the dancing baby and to them that was fine. Its awful.\n\nThe direction is poor. It has no comic sense. The wacky mask sequences fall flat. Whats worse is that they can't even approximate the classic Looney Tunes/MGM cartoons they copy.\n\nWhat annoys me is that this isn't so bad its good, its just bad.\n\nWhile this is certainly to be on my list of worst films of 2005, I can't give it the one out of ten it deserves, watching this I had the feeling that had this been better cast and directed this film might have actually worked. For the promise of what might have been I give this a two, however understand thats no reason to watch this waste of celluloid, this is a film best dropped in a very deep well for all eternity.",
