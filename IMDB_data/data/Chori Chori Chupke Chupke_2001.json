        "reviewBody": "In this drama, happily married Raj (Salman Khan) and Priya (Rani Mukerji) are devastated to learn that Priya can not have children. She considers adoption, but for certain reasons, settles on the idea of a secret surrogate pregnancy. Raj finds a young prostitute, Madhubala (Preity Zinta) who is willing to carry a child for the couple. As can be expected, the path chosen by Raj and Priya is not a smooth one.\n\nFor the most part, this is a solidly good film, that has the viewer uncertain as to what will be the eventual outcome. Those familiar with Hollywood's Pretty Woman, will recognize certain scenes, but they work quite well in this setting, too. Khan seems to have only one emotion in this movie, and Mukerji spends most of her time weeping. However, they are generally convincing in their roles, especially as they are the backdrop for Zinta's exceptional performance as Madhu. Regardless of how one feels about the topic, the movie is worth watching for her alone. \n\nThe cast also includes Amrish Puri, Farida Jalal, Prem Chopra, and Johnny Lever.",
