        "reviewBody": "This follows two Sudanese boys who immigrated to the United States from a refugee camp. I have always had an interest in other cultures and the way in which the U.S. culture is perceived by those abroad.\n\nThis movie held some special interest for me. Peter moved to Olathe, KS where I have lived for 19 years and went to Olathe East High School where my oldest son attended school a grade behind Peter.\n\nIt is interesting how the perception of the U.S. changed from one of wild idealism to the realism of hard work. As may kids were going up, I kept telling my kids they don't live in the real world, they live in Olathe. This is an exceptionally affluent area and it was interesting when Peter remarked about being a poor person in the midst of rich people's kids.\n\nMy oldest son is a few month in the real world now. He is living, ironically, Houston, TX where the other principal character, Santino lived. It was also interesting to see the contrasts in the lifestyles in Olathe and Houston.\n\nAs a documentary, I found it interesting, but honestly, I don't think it would have had the same impact had it not had hit so close to home. It was indeed interesting, but I didn't find it as profound as I had expected. If you are interested in how the U.S. fits in the scheme of our global neighborhood, this is still worth a look.",
