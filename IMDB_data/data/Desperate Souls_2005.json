The cover of the movie and first 3-5 minutes had me thinking this could turn into an alright B movie, boy was I wrong. The actors (if you can call them that) who were in this should have been in an over the top drama class not a \"horror flick\" and the dialog...wow, that was by far the worst I think I have ever watched. By the way...it doesn't take a lot of money to write well. Good thing Blockbuster sent us a free pass or else I would have requested my money back!",
