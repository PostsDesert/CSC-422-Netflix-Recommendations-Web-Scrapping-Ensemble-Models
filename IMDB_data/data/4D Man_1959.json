        "reviewBody": "Wow, I searched for years to get this on DVD. I first saw it back in High School on one of those midnight horror shows in Australia (Deadly Earnest was the host...anyone from Australia remember him??).\n\nI remember being obsessed with the walking through walls special effect, the way in which bits of his clothing would appear first, then the rest of him.\n\nIt's funny how a film can stay with you from childhood. The day I got the DVD, I was stoked. Not the greatest film ever made, but I am a die hard fan. I admit to being surprised by the score, very jazzy for such a dark story. I thought Robert Lansing and the rest of the cast were cool. They gave some considerable depth to what was after all very much a 'B' movie.\n\nCheck it out!",
