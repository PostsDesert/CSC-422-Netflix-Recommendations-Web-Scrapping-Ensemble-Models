        "reviewBody": "Lou Diamond Phillips sadly signed his name to this train wreck of a \"movie\". Phillips does his best to make lemonade from this lemon of a script, but it proves fruitless. The unknown supporting cast laughably overacts. The writing is awkward & the characters are unsympathetic.\n\nPhillips plays a military detective, and former MP, who comes to the Presidio (the former military base in San Francisco that was closed and converted into a national park in 1994, not to be confused with the Presidio in Monterrey, CA which houses the Defense Language Institute) to solve a murder. His love interest, a female MP who looks extremely awkward in her over-sized uniform, proves way too easy, so it is difficult to sympathize with them as individuals or as a couple.\n\nThe plot boasts TV-ready predictability, and the production was obviously made for TV- there were even breaks in the movie to insert commercials! What a disappointment. \n\nMy advice...skip \"Murder at the Presidio\" and watch a \"Law & Order\" rerun instead. The plot will undoubtedly be more interesting.",
