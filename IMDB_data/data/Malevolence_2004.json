        "reviewBody": "I just enjoyed this flick. However, having read the other reviews, I'm seriously wondering if viewers may have been on crack or are close friends with the director? Are they serious? No, seriously? I think that the best aspect of the movie is the fact that the director imbued it with so many MAJOR components of 80's B slasher flicks - the really bad synth music, the twisted ankle, the incessant screaming, the double twist ending - but without a hint of irony, which is rather difficult to do I would imagine! The tone is extremely deadpan. If someone had told me I was watching a horror movie made in 1988, I would have completely believed it - and is a very significant statement coming from someone like me by the way. Whether intentional or unintended, the movie works for both thrills and chills. Fun stuff - no second coming like a few other critics declare. An addendum to this story. My good friend left several messages recently for me indicating that she wanted to go to \"Male Violence\" - yes, several times she told me that we simply must see \"Male Violence\"? I asked her to spell it for me...\"M- A-L-E-V-O-L-E-N-C-E\"....\"you haven't heard about Male Violence\"? So in thanks to this movie I learned that my friend can't spell or really speak...wow.",
