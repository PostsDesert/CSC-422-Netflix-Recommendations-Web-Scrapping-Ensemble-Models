        "reviewBody": "After \"Now Voyager\" this is my favorite film of Davis. If you see the short subject on this film, the director said Davis loved a challenge and she took on the role of the \"too pretty\" Fanny Trellis because she felt she could \"pull it off\"... and in my humble opinion, she did that very well indeed. Some say she had a \"pretentious\" and \"irritating\" character, it is indeed the character of Fanny Trellis who is both pretentious and irritating. That is built into the character herself. I had a relative who behaved just as she did in this film. Davis especially reminded me of this aunt of mine when she visits Mr. Skeffington in his office when war is declared. She was artificially fragile, overly made-up, and oh too charming. Davis was brilliant in her portrayal of Fanny as the spoiled, fussy, prissy young woman who the \"men\" really go after.... but unlike today where most men are after physical attributes, it is Fanny's charm and her apparent wealth they are also attracted to. In reality, her character has none of these things.... it is an illusion, just as her life is an illusion. I think she did a marvelous job in a demanding and difficult role. The film also has one of the most remarkable music scores on film. Every scene is perfectly synchronized by Franz Waxman's magnificent score."
