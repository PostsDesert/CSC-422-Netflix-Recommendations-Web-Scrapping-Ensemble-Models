And no it's not some pointy guy with horns saying hello. Watch the movie and you'll see... (damn I just got chills thinking about it). OK OK I'll let you in on a secret - devil lives in the burning fire of destruction and is embodied in your lover (ok still doesn't make sense till you see the movie).\n\nWell Johnny Depp is a quite good actor I must say, and shooting this thingy all around Europe gives it a fresh 'travel channel' vibe while you go about chasing down demon relics and whatnot - even makes me long for a stay in some of those funky little hotels! :) I must visit! Maybe I shal meet El Diablo...\n\nThis is a very VERY elegant horror movie. NO bloody gutsy to speak of - but lots of good plot things happening and just all around very 'cool'."
