It is a thinking man's (or woman's) horror. It give the selling your soul story and interesting twist.\n\nMiguel Ángel Solá (The Whore and the Whale) is brilliant as the title character, an oncologist that doesn't seem to care about the patients he serves. Eduard Fernández (Che: Part 2, and the impossible to find, Alatriste) is fascinating as the devil.\n\nIt gets gory, and it it seems a mess at times, but I couldn't take my eyes away. It was a great story."
