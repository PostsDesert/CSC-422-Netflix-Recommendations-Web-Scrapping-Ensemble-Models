This has to do with a Dragon Figurine that has a connection to Goemon's mighty sword.\n\nWhile there's this Chinese Mob leader who looks more like an onion roll head who wants this Dragon Figurine for himself.\n\nThe animation is very well done. And this TV movie is another good Lupin Anime. Those who like Goemon will like this one.\n\nHas some funny parts to it as well.\n\nInclduing the parts when Lupin escape from Zennigata.\n\nI recommend 13 and older for this one. Only has one nudity scene.\n\nBut still worth buying for all you Lupin fans.",
