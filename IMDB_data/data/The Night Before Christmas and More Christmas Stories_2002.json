        "reviewBody": "This early Tom and Jerry cartoon can be excused if it is overly cute-over-comedy in subject matter. Hey, it's the Christmas season and this cartoon reflects that in an old-fashioned, nice way.\n\nApparently, this is Jerry's first Christmas because he's amazed to see Christmas tree ornaments, candy canes and stuff animals and other presents under the tree.\n\nThis does have the usual chase scene, but isn't that long and the film ends on a very touching sentimental note the last few minutes.\n\nAs others have said, this is about as nice as Christmas cartoon as you're ever going to find. At the beginning, I thought this might be nothing but it's such a feel-good Tom & Jerry that it's very, very worthy of being in anyone's collection.",
