Noticeably missing is the character \"Clete Purcell\" who was Dave R's former NOPD homicide partner. I see that Tommy Lee Jones will tackle A TV version of another Robicheaux mystery of which 16 Robicheaux novels have been written. Moe action by Baldwin and an interplay between he and the missing Clete Purcell might have brought this movie along further into another feature. New Orleans is always the great mixture of characters and places for mystery, murder and mayhem.\n\nAlex Baldwin does a great job given some of the missing flavor of James Lee Burkes writing. Baldwin made a great looking \"Shadow\" as well with an unfortunate script.",
