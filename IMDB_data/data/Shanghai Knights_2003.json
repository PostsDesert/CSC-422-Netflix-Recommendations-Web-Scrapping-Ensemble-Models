        "reviewBody": "Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson get together again in \"Shanghai Knights,\" the sequel to \"Shanghai Noon.\" It's difficult to say which I like better, although the two seem a little more at home in \"Noon.\" \"Knights\" is a movie not to be taken seriously. The soundtrack attests to that, being mostly British invasion rock from the 1960's. And there is a lot of historical fudging, not the least of which is Owen Wilson's dialogue and attitude. He just seems so miscast as a cowboy. What keeps this movie from going wrong is Jackie Chan's amazing moves. Here he shows where he shines as an action-comedy star. And the martial arts styles of Fann Wong and Donnie Yen are no slouch either! So, never mind the anachronisms, just prepare to admire Jackie Chan.",
