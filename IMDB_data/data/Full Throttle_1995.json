The acting from all of the actors was excellent, except for maybe the girlfriend. I watched it dubbed in Mandarin and the woman who did her voice-over sounded like a Hello Kitty or something. I thought the psychological development of the characters made so much sense. I liked the scene where the camera takes the perspective of a small boy. The performances from the older characters, especially the grandmother's were great. Wow!\n\nDespite similarities to movies like Rocky, this doesn't play out the same way.\n\n9/10",
