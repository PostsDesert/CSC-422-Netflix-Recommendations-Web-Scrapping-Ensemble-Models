        "reviewBody": "Lackawanna Blues is a story that many should be able to relate to. It was filled with joy, laughter, mixed with a little sorrow. Afterall, I have seen it about eight times since it has been coming on HBO and it still seems fresh each time I view it. S. Epatha Merkerson did a fantastic job as \"Nanny\" (the neighborhood mother). Her character was reminiscent of the neighborhood mothers in my day. Terrance Howard did an exceptional job portraying her husband, \"Bill\". He was a \"protector\" of his family despite his shortcomings. Macy gray did a fine job portraying, Pauline. All of the cast members were exceptional and rare. We must not forget Marcus (who played young Rueben), He did exceptionally well. I look forward to seeing more of him as he grow up. He has skills at such a young, tender age. I really enjoyed this movie and cannot stop saying good things about it. I have alerted many of my friends and family members to see it. They all were amazed.There need to be more movies like this one. It left you with a bitter sweet feeling but never disappointed."
