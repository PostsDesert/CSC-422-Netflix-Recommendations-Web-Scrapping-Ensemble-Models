        "reviewBody": "The epic movie,White Fang 2, is about a young man. This man was named Henry. Henry lived alone in the forest and mined with his best friend, a wolf named White Fang. One nice day they go fishing on the river and they get caught in the dangerous rapids. Henry is rescued by Lily, an beautiful Indian girl, who takes him to her village. Secretly Henry likes Lily, but she has been hurt by white men before. In Lily's Indian village, White Fang is very important and they hold ceremonies in honor of him. The tribe's elder named Moses thinks that Henry is the man form of White Fang and they begin to worship him. The tribe tells Henry he needs to go find the caribou to get food for the winter.\n\nI reccomend this movie for anyone who likes action, adventure movies. This movie also had a little bit of romance, but nothing to serious. I think this movie is great for kids and adults of all ages."
