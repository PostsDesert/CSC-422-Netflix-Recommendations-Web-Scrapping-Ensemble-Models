        "reviewBody": "A fine documentary by a seasoned author of pop lore. I got a lot more than I expected from this deep thinking DVD and learned much about the already well worn long and winding road of Beatlemania from the thoughtful commentary. With lots of ultra rare footage and a solid script/narration by Giuliano, The Beatles: A Celebration was great eye candy for Beatles fans of all ages. Particularly interesting was the take no prisoners marketing of the Beatles and their inner quest for meaning after the initial global onslaught of Beatlemania. Giuliano is a gripping narrator and Mark Devito did a fine job of telling this amazing tale with wit, brevity, compassion and irony.",
