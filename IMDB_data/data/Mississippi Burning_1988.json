        "reviewBody": "This drama-thriller is loosely based on the FBI investigation into the real-life murders of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964, providing an additional value to anyway skillful plot (by Chris Gerolmo) and direction (by Alan Pakula). In comparison to other states, Mississippi was (and largely is) behind the times in many ways, and many crimes were launched or not disclosed due to overall mentality and indifference -- thus, community solidarity can have both good and bad elements. The movie shows how difficult is to investigate if people are at bay, and when certain activities are not perceived as felonies. The events are logical and catchy to follow, largely thanks to character actors like Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe, Frances McDormand, and Brad Dourif who make a difference even while being briefly on screen -- no cute faces or politically correct solutions, but harsh and effective methods for solving a severe crime.\n\nIt is neither family movie not entertainment, but depiction of black spot in the US history after WWII. But laid out and performed well, without digital effects or long reasoning on human values.",
