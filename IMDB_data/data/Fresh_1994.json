It\n\nstands out head and shoulders above the rest as an engaging and\n\nintelligent film. Part of 'Fresh's strength is that it belies\n\nmany of the genre's expected conventions. Rap music is vaguely\n\nincidental, giving way to a poignant soundtrack by Stewart\n\nCopeland. For once, gang life, alcoholism, and drug addiction\n\nare never glamourized as they are simultaneously condemned...\n\nthe fault of so many films which purport to be morally aware of\n\nthe destructive nature of these things (but seem to say,\n\nbackhandedly, \"isn't T-Bone a badd mutha, though?\") And as\n\nanother reviewer noted, the central character as an intellectual\n\nprodigy is neither a joke nor a gimmick, his mind is the means\n\nof his survival and eventually his triumph over the forces\n\naround him. The cast is excellent, the standouts being an\n\nextraordinary debut by Sean Nelson as the Fresh and the reliable\n\nSamuel L. Jackson as his alcoholic speed-chess-master father.\n\nThe final scene is one of the most devastating and memorable\n\nscenes in the last decade of films. The sincerity and unpredictability of 'Fresh' are unparalleled in films of its\n\ntype."
