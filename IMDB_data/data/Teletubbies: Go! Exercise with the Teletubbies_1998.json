God knows why Everything you need to know about the movie is right there in the title. Dipsy, Tinky Winky, Laa-Laa and Po .... dancing. For an hour. Aaarrrggghhhh.\n\nWhat's worse, your 3 year old loves it so much, he 'll want to see it over and over again :) So if you truly love your kid, and are prepared to go through any sort of pain to make him happy, buy him this video. If you like your kid, but aren't going to go through hell for him ... leave well alone ;)",
