        "reviewBody": "Having this movie shot in my hometown (Great Falls, Montana), I answered a local casting call for extras. Blink and you'll miss me in the bonfire/party scene. My high school (Great Falls High) was the school used in the beginning of the film, and the locker room the team is in happens to be the girl's locker room. David Morse's character lives above a vacuum place downtown. The hospital in the movie used to actually be the old Colombus hospital, but is now a office building.\n\nThe twins in the movie (Matt and Paul Pippinich), I went to school with for 7 years, and that old orange truck is theirs. Matt played clarinet in a dixieland jazz band.\n\nWhen I saw this movie at the Wilma theater in Missoula, MT, one of the directors was there to answer questions. He said that they chose Great Falls (pop. approx. 60,000) for shooting \"because it was sort of the town that time forgot.\" In some ways, this is true, but the city is not as run down and rural as it appears in the movie.\n\nOverall, I found myself enjoying this movie more for the \"hey, I know him!\" or \"I lived 2 miles from there\" situations. While this wasn't a movie that I would want to watch repeatedly, I still highly suggest it for rental. It's more than just a \"sports\" movie.\n\nAlso, a stellar soundtrack that makes the movie that much better."
