If ever one wants to see a series that makes one feel good at the end, hire these.\n\nI wish I could own the series.\n\nCatherine Zita Jones is absolutely one of the most beautiful British actresses out of UK, and also a good actress also.\n\nI loved the context of the series. And Pop and Mum were great, never got married etc., and Mum a little heavy after giving birth to what 'seven kids' was a great cook etc.\n\nI challenge anyone who watches this series not to feel hungry watching them all enjoy eating, even if they have to kill the goose etc. \n\nA great British produced series, wish there were more!",
