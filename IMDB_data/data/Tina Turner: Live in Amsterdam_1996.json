Her voice still soars like an angel. If you couldn't make the concert in Amsterdam, Holland, this DVD is the next best thing. Pay attention and watch the credits, she performs a finale song to the audience. The cast and the crew did a terrific job. Tina Turner is an American original icon, musical legend and performer. She can sing soulful like \"Something Beautiful Remains\" and \"On Silent Wings,\" or she can rise with \"The Best\" and other of her classics. As Tina got older, she got better and stronger as a performer.",
