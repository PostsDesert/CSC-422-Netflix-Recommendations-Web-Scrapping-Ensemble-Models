        "reviewBody": "MovieAddict2005 painted a very cruel picture of a very sensitive picture.. Mel Gibson's feeling for the not-too-bright, but likable character Tim was a great tribute to the all-round acting talent of a man too easily typecast as an action actor. Piper Laurie was as ever a joy to watch in the difficult part of \"the older woman\" and endured ageism , (possibly exhibited a little by MovieAddict2005) with dignity, as did Gibson's character against narrow-minded people who are more \"retarded\" than he is..\n\nThe growing love between them - which came from nowhere, as it should -was as beautiful and real as acting can get.\n\nIf the overall production was modest, that's OK. Hollywood is not necessarily the best presenter of simple yet complex human conflict and pain.Australian movies, as shown by such as \"Mariel's Wedding\" (yes, I know about the spelling) have moved on since the uncomfortable silences of the wooden TV series \"Spy Force\" and the sheer embarrassment of the \"cult\" \"The Outback\" \n\nThe Yahoo Movies (sorry!) review described \"Tim\" as \"superb\". Rightly Though I dislike numeric ratings, I was asked for one - I gave 7/10. If this sounds low, I'd give the marvellous \"The Elephant Man\" only 9, even though it has the most moving moment in movie history - the close-up of Anthony Hopkins' face when he realises Merrick could read. You could feel the tears in his eyes as they came to your own. \"Tim\"'s close-ups could not hope to match this, but they were quietly stunning\n\nNo film has ever got 10 - perfection doesn't exist. I would score even Citizen Kane, the greatest of all, 9.5. But \"Tim\" gets 9/10 for sincerity"
