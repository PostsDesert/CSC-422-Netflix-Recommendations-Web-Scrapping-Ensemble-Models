Almost worthless outside the rather charming romance that develops between the characters played by Judge Reinhold and Patrika Darbo. Tess Harper is also a very sympathetic and likable character as a daughter always living in the shadow of her much loved sister and willing to sacrifice too much of her own life for some validation."
