        "reviewBody": "I use these videos (there are five included) as tools for teaching organized crime. Students do not soon forget the episode on Russia with the guy who brokered a deal for a Russian submarine- a story loosely translated in Lord of War. It is also interesting to see organized crime in India and China- two places that many people do not think of regarding organized crime. To some degree the series is very conservative in that it focuses on specialization and hierarchy, but it definitely adds color to any textbook or article covering these areas. I found that each video does a very good job of presenting the basic historical elements necessary to understand the current state of the problem.",
