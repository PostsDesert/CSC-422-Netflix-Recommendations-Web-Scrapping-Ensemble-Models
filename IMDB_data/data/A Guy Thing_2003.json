        "reviewBody": "When it comes to mainstream romantic comedies, I try to avoid them as much as I can, but sometimes they are done so well, or dumb that they deserve a viewing. This is the case with the A Guy Thing (I guess it would be called Bro Thing nowadays) directed by Chris Koch ( Scrubs, My Name Is Earl, Snow Day) and starring Jason Lee and Julia Stiles. At its core this is a classic love story where guy realizes that he loves someone else and that besides her he can be himself (wait 'till you start living together and we'll see how that turns out for ya), but there are enough gags and jokes to keep things interesting. Granted there isn't enough R-rated humor or nudity but still Jason Lee makes any movie work. And the fact that they didn't resort to any tricks or overly sappy scenes only works to their benefit.\n\nPaul is getting married and we meet up with him on his bachelor party where he's quite bored and in love with his future wife. Even when the exotic dancers show up he doesn't seem excited, but he will be when he wakes up the next morning with one of them in his bed. Dazed and confused he chucks her out of the apartment since his future wife is arriving in a few minutes, and he's not in the mood for threesome. Thinking that that's that he carries on with his life trying to forget the whole thing but he keeps bumping into that girl. But what is really gonna rock his world is when he finds out that she is Karen's very close cousin and that she's attending the weddingÂ…\n\nCheck out my review site Rabbit-Reviews for movies that are worth watching, Rabbit out..."
