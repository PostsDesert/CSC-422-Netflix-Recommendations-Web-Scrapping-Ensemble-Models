I am sorry to say this sequel is one of my least favourites of the franchise, my least favourite being Wisdom of Friends. The animation is pretty decent, the voice acting is well done, the film moves quickly, there is some nice messaging and the Tinysauruses are cute. However, this sequel also has an episodic story structure and laboured plot, forgettable music, childish dialogue and the characters are less emphatic here. Ducky is fine but Cera is very bratty here. Overall, it is okay, but it isn't great. 4/10 Bethany Cox",
