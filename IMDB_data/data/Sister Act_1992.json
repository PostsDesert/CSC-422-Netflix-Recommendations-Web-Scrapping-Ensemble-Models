        "reviewBody": "TIDBIT - Bette Midler was the original choice for the lead in \"Sister Act\".\n\nThat may have been cute (a Jewish nun?) but in choosing Whoopi, \"Sister Act\" gives itself a shot in the arm with an incomparable comic talent and insures every scene with Deloris/Mary Clarence is a highlight unto itself. \n\n After witnessing a Mob hit courtesy of her boyfriend (Keitel), casino lounge singer Whoopi hightails it to her local police where a helpful cop (Nunn) puts her in the Witness Protection Program and before you can say \"holy, holy, holy\", sends her to the last place in the world anyone would think of finding a second-rate lounge singer. \n\nOnce the church, nuns and choir music with a Motown beat are all introduced, things pick up steadily. All the nuns are funny (especially Najimy as the eternally sunny Sister Mary Patrick) and there are so many good scenes to be had thereafter (the bar scene, the first choir practice, the blossoming of Sister Mary Robert (Makkenna), etc.), that you can't help but smile, even if you're tired of nuns as a springboard for comedy. \n\nAnd there's something about the music: the gospel-tinged soul songs like \"My God\", \"I Will Follow Him\" and such lift your spirits and are infectious in their own right. The last scene in the movie is quite moving, truth be told, and lets you in on a secret... God moves in mysterious ways.\n\nAmen.\n\nNine stars. These \"Sister\"s rock!",
