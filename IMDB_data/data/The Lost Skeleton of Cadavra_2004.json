        "reviewBody": "Odd flick. Quite obviously a spoof of all bad 1950's creature and space movies, so watching it can be arduous at times. However, it's always a fun ride. There are at least two or three very, very funny parts.\n\nThis is a very low budget, funny movie, because of the send up of dialogue, rather then jokes and one liners as an example...\"I don't know Betty, I guess from now on I should stick to science and leave battling alien mutants to experts.\" or \"My wife sometimes forgets she's not a space alien\". The costumes and sets are reminiscent of the low budget movies as well. The costume design on the three headed mutant was mind blowing. I needed to watch the credits just to find out that a MAN was in the mutant suit...the design was that convincing! ONe last quote to leave with...\"Well, if I wanted a safe life, I guess I wouldn't have married a man who studies rocks and you know the way I figure, if it's a way to stop my new alien best friend from becoming a widow and married to a skeleton then, count me in Mister Scientist.\" Fold yourself in the middle and enjoy this movie, just know what you're about to get into before you start watching it.",
