Jason Stuart is the voice of the everyday gay guy. the hell with all the west Hollywood muscle Marys. Also all these Hollywood actors who think it is so brave to play gay. with there cowboy hats and perfect everything. Jason is the new breed of gay who is invisible to the mainstream studio films. he is funny, sweet and yeas sexy. Also a really fine actor who deserves the same PR as the straight actors who play the roles gay actors should of got. I just loved this film because it was so original. I cant wait to see what Jason does next!"
