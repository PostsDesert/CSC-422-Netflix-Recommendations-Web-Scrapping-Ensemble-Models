        "reviewBody": "Disclaimer: It really helps you to understand and appreciate this film if you have an interest in or knowlege of early cinema or Germany or the film \"Nosferatu\". I have watched it 5+ times and i find something new everytime~.\n\n If you're looking for a horror movie, that's not what SOTV is. You'll probably be bored or dissapointed. The strength of this film is the dialogue and interacion betw. the characters (IMHO)\n\nJohn Malkovich is F.W. Marnau, the great german director of the 20s and Willem Dafoe plays Max Schreck, the Nosferatu of Marnau's classic. This film chronicles the making of this kooky and classic film. It's not a literal interpertation though. (at least i hope not)\n\nThe characters were supposed to be German, but each spoke in their own unique tongue. In particular, John Malkovich's Marnau spoke in the same hybrid accent Malkie uses in every movie.\n\nCary Elwes-- I don't know what kind of accent he had, but it was fantastic. His swashbuckling camera-whiz is a bright light of raw sexuality in this otherwise darkly comic venture.\n\nThis isn't a funny movie, but it definitely has its comic moments. Pay attenion to Malkie's passionate soliloquies...they are hilarious. And Dafoe is just classic. The interaction between the two makes the movie.\n\n Anyone whose been to film school or art school knows kids who are just like Malkie's obsessed \"you're overwhelming my composition!\" director.\n\n This film is quite an experience. And i will never tire of watching it."
