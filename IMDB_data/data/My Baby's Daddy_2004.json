The only part that repulsed me was making the babies talk (as seen in the preview), but at least there was some kind of reason for it and it didn't last too long.\n\nYes, most of the plot was predictable, but it was still a good story. It moves quickly between the three men, but the three of them go through similar ordeals so it's not confusing. My favorite parts were those with G and his lover's Chinese family, and the role Eddie Griffin played as Lonnie. Even if you don't think \"My Baby's Daddy\" is your type of movie, you might actually like it."
