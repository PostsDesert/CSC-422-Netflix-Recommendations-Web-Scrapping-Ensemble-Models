        "reviewBody": "Back in Hollywood, after a two-year stint in the US army, Elvis Presley (as Tulsa McLean) is a stationed-in-Germany singing soldier out to bed sexy dancer Juliet Prowse (as Lili). This tailor-made film set the standard for the successful \"ELVIS\" movie. Presley spent the 1960s swinging and singing through \"Top Ten\" box office and record charts. \"G.I Blues\" propelled Elvis back into Quigley Publications \"Box Office\" ten most profitable movie stars, where he stayed through 1966. The RCA soundtrack went platinum, and was #1 for ten of its amazing 111 weeks on the LP chart. RCA planned no 45 RPM singles (which helped album sales), but \"Wooden Heart\" and \"G.I. Blues\" became hits anyway.\n\nUnfortunately, the musical's trend-setting success overshadowed Presley's superior studio recordings from the time (listen to \"Elvis Is Back!\"). Also note, the re-recording of \"Blue Suede Shoes\" is a pale imitation of the 1956 original. So, a creative cancer was being forged. But, it's not fair to fault \"G.I. Blues\" for the sight and sound of Elvis Presley singing \"Old MacDonald Had a Farm\" in \"Double Trouble\" (1967). And, although everyone (including Presley) longed for him to be a great dramatic actor, he shows up in \"G.I. Blues\" as a charming and natural light performer. Herein, Presley introduces many of the playful mannerisms used throughout the remainder of his career, in musicals and on stage.\n\n****** G.I. Blues (8/18/60) Norman Taurog ~ Elvis Presley, Juliet Prowse, Robert Ivers, James Douglas",
