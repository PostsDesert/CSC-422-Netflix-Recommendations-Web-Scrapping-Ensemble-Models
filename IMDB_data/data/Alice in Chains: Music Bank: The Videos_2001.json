        "reviewBody": "I bought Alice in Chains:Music Bank-The Videos during the hight of my Alice in Chains frenzy and it was one of the best purchases I have ever made.\n\nMusic Bank is basically a quick documentary from the bands early days which is more or less just guitarist Jerry Cantrell talking about his hopes for Alice and a collection of every music video made by Alice in Chains. The videos are broken up by selected \"home video clips\" of the band either on stage or just being themselves, it is these moments that fans will treasure as you see Alice in Chains not just as musicians but as a group of friends just having fun and enjoying what they are doing.\n\nThe videos themselves are worth watching, the striking images capture the dramatic feeling of the bands music. Even the incredibly shocking video for \"Rooster\" has been included in its original uncut state, making it a highlight not just on the DVD but as one of the most awe inspiring music videos you will ever have the pleasure to see.\n\nIf you are an Alice in Chains fan then you must see this, if you are not a fan or have never really heard Alice in Chains before, watch this and challenge yourself not to fall in love.",
