        "reviewBody": "Gotta love Alice Cooper. Hes one of the great performers that continue a \"metal\" legacy. When you see his concert you definitley get your dollars worth. But its hard to beleive, 30 yrs later, his equal counterpart, Ozzy Osbourne, still holds more popularity then Alice. Both are great musicians, both have done alot for the music business, but Ozzy is credited as being the father of heavy metal. Maybe its a british invasion thing, i don't know. But one things for sure, Ozzy and Alice should go on tour together. That would be a metal fans dream come true. As far as this dvd is concerned. GET IT GET IT GET IT. Especially if you have never seen him in concert before. A must have for anyone who likes to be entertained for 90 minutes.",
