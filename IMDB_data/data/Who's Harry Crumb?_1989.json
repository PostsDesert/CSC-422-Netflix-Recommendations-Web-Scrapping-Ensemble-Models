        "reviewBody": "'Who's Harry Crumb' rests on the shoulders of the brilliant John Candy. The late comedy legend rules the show, with a lovable, hilarious performance, that appeals entirely. \n\n'Who's Harry Crumb' Synopsis: Harry Crumb is a bumbling and inept private investigator who is hired to solve the kidnapping of a young heiress which he's not expected to solve because his employer is the mastermind behind the kidnapping.\n\n'Who's Harry Crumb' is funny in parts. Some jokes are silly, some laugh-out-loud funny & some are pretty lame. But, in totality, the humor works for its targeted audience - the kids & the kids at heart. Its a passable one-time watch. \n\nThe Screenplay is flawed, but some memorable moments do the trick. Paul Flaherty's Direction is decent. Cinematography is standard. Editing & Art Design are okay. \n\nPerformance-Wise: Its John Candy all the way. As Harry Crumb, the late comedy legend doesn't miss a beat & delivers in every sequence. He's the soul of the film. Amongst the supporting cast, Jeffrey Jones is terrific. \n\nOn the whole, 'Who's Harry Crumb' is a must for John Candy Fans.",
