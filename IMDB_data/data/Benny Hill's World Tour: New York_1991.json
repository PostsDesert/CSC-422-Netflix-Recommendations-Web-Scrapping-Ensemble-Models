And the faces he makes and skits and shorts enough to make Harpo Marx upstaged, or enough to make Mr. Bean look like a rip-off. This one is where he tours New York, learning rap, how to meet beautiful women, the historical and hot spots in New York, and getting involved with gangs. And not to mention getting in drag once again, and impersonating an Oriental man again, yeah! And with all the dialog free parts, the ones with speech were also hilarious, I haven't stopped laughing in days and can't forget them! This was his final TV appearance, if only he was hear, we could see another, but rest in peace sweet prince, I love your work and this show. Recommended for all fans of the show, or those who like Mr. Bean, watch it, it's great mate!",
