        "reviewBody": "I love baseball and documentaries and I am from Chicago. I am a die-hard Cubs fan and think Ron Santo should be in the Hall of Fame. But this movie is depressing. Yes it is real life, but this is depressing. There should have been more about Santo's playing days and successes. He was a great player and I would like to hear more from other players and baseball experts about Santo and the Cubs. The movie could show more of Santo's life after baseball as a broadcaster without showing so much of the depressing parts of his life. The movie should talk about diabetes and how Santo lives with it, but it does not have to spend so much time and be so graphic about the disease."
