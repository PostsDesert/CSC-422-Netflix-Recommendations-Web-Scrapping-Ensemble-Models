Don't take you eyes or ears off the screen, every second counts!\n\nRoddy Doyle can present Irish family life at its best and most painful and The Snapper will leave you gasping for more. Colm Meaney is as always amazing but pay attention to Ruth McCabe and Tina Kellegher, quick dry wit from the former and outlandish comments from the latter. Very very clever!"
