        "reviewBody": "Not an easy film to get to see in the UK. I had read many reviews giving this film the thumbs down; when I finally saw it I thought it was an excellent example of a 1950's horror/sci-fi movie attempting to cash in on the current trend which was tending towards the sci-fi element.This film hedges its bets by having both elements i.e Dr Jeykyll's potions for sci-fi and the \"werewolf\" for the supernatural horror. It also has the element of the \"mystery\" created by Arthur Shields'(Barry Fitzgerald's brother) attempts to explain everything away. All no doubt intended to mystify the teenagers who were the film's target audience. However,in spite of all this there is a nice creepy atmosphere to the film and it kept me interested for the 75 minutes or so running time.(Apparently for US TV airings,the \"monster chase \" scene from \"Frankenstein 1970\"was added in an attempt to boost the length.) Now for the question-is the film's \"success\" due to Edgar Ulmer's presence? Personally I think so but I am apparently in the minority"
