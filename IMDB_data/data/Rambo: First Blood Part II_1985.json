        "reviewBody": "When I was a kid and I watched the first Rambo and this one, I thought the order was wrong. Here Rambo goes to war in the first one he came back from one. Well I was clueless what can I say. It's also not like I saw any social commentary or understood what PTSD is. I know I probably was too young to have watched them, but that I also did not know at the time.\n\nHaving rewatched the first three again recently, I remembered them and my memory got freshened up on a lot of things too. The action is pretty stellar in this one and we get some recognizable characters back and some new ones added. Now the main twist is very predictable, but the movie still works despite that. I remember the horror I felt when the slugs scene came up. But I learned about the salt \"trick\" too - not that I got a chance to use it (thankfully).",
