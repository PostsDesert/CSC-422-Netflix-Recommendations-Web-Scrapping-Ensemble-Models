        "reviewBody": "I will be brief. Buy it, it's a must! George Peppard plays his role, Stachel, to the hilt in this WWI war drama. He is supported by very talented and well-known actors such as James Mason, Ursula Andress, Anton Diffring and many others.\n\nThe image is sharp and the colors are vivid. The sound is a bit conventional, but since the story is all-encompassing and well developed you will probably forget all technicalities and just sit through an excellent movie as I did.\n\nThe story deals with a simple German infantry soldier, stuck in the horror of the trench warfare, who dreams to fly and become an ace.\n\nWell, he doesn't have to wait long and soon he's a flyer. he also becomes an ace.\n\nUnfortunately, his modest social origins, keep him from the Sun, the Blue Max in fact. The Blue Max is the highest ranking medal given to pilots in WWI.\n\nKnowing that, Stachel (Peppard) decides to fight all the odds and becomes totally ruthless and opportunistic.\n\nUnluckily for him, two can play at the same game. The German Reich needs a hero, an example to play its cards right, in order to have more draftees to send to the front.\n\nStachel becomes such a hero, but to a price...\n\nIt is a crude and cruel depiction of the rise and fall of someone who came from nothing and through war, thought he could make it in society, only to find out that certain games are better left alone.\n\nA very good morals and ethics lesson, from which many people could still learn something.\n\nI can only suggest it. The rest is up to you."
