I didn't like the way that they were portrayed. A lack of chemistry and depth of feeling. Some characters were unrelatable, others were just plain misplaced/cringeworthy. I just thought, what're they doing here?\n\nThe music, rachet music, was foul to my ears and the more I watched, the less tolerable it became. This is critical because music does a lot to the viewing experience and it goes both ways. In Reckless' case, the music was... terrible. Very unfortunate.\n\nSo Reckless as a plot and concept does have potential, I do recognise, but this production does not do the said plot/love triangle dynamic justice, at least not to me.",
