Carol's supposedly dead husband comes back, leaving the Brady household confused, so they do they only thing that will help - fly over to Hawaii (of course!)!\n\nYet more laughs and more funny lines (ie. [coming off the plane] Mike: Where's Marcia? Cindy: She's been lay-ed by those Hawaiian boys!) Ahem, yeah, but you might wanna check this one out for yourself!\n\nThe Brady kids aren't short of singing numbers either, not on a stage though, this time on the 'groovy' plane!"
