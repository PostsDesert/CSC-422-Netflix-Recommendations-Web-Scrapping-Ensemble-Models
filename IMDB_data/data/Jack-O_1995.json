But also because It's has my two fav scream queens in it. Linnea Quigley and Brinke Stevens. Linnea did a bang up job in this movie. I was actually surprised because her acting so good. And it interesting to see Brinke in a cameo role as a witch. But there were some cool death scenes and I liked the way it was shot. 16mm. My favorite besides digital. Anyway, just rent this movie and eat some pizza. Make sure it's extra cheesy!!!"
