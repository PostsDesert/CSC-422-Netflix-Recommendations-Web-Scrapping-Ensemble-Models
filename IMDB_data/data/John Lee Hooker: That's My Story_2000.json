        "reviewBody": "I'm not sure seeing this would make you a fan, but it sure didn't detract from my admiration of this idiosyncratic artist. Good concert footage of a set with Charlie Musselwhite, Elvin Bishop and others. Lots of shots of John Lee being chauffeured about San Francisco. You might think that would be annoying, but instead it fits well into the mood of the story of a man's life who moved to his own laconic rhythm. Various interviews with John and his family, some more with Clapton and Peter Wolf. Interesting theory from John Lee about his not being able to read. He says that if he knew how to read he would never have been able to dedicate his life to guitar-playing and the blues. He would have been reading books all the time. As he insists, he's smart, and I had never thought about it before, but he was. Worth seeing if you enjoy his music.",
