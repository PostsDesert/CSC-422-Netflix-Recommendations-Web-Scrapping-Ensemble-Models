And, as usual, really stupid characters...the only one with two brain cells to rub together was the hunter. I kept cheering on the 'cat to kill them all. (Due to the long list of stupidity, I won't bother trying to list them)\n\nNotice the set up for a sequel. \"What's wrong? Never hear two cats mating?\" Bet that puma was a female."
