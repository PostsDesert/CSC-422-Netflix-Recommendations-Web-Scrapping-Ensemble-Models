Have no idea how this \"Gem\" got past me but sang You Are So Beautiful in Karaoke at a Trailer Park To my GrandDaughter jokingly in Joe Cocker Voice (More Ha Ha) as 13 year old (who takes Ballet and Tap lessons) improve danced to song. So overwhelmed I tracked down this concert DVD and Auto Bio and over a Bottle of Italian Red I was reinvigorated at what Joe Cocker Brought to the Industry as a 1st Class Singer, He put together an exceptional Band cast at this gorgeous Venue. How Wonderful Someone can leave a legacy that comes straight from the heart to me and you. Too bad We couldn't see a Sade /Joe Cocker Tour[Last Ha Ha",
