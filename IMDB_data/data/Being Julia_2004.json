        "reviewBody": "Based on W. Somerset Maugham's novella István Szabó's 'Being Julia' tells the story of burnt out theatre star who's bored with her life and is going through amid-life crisis of sorts, complaining to anyone who'll pay attention until she meets a young American fan which. This leads her to rediscover her lust for life as well as facing new challenges. \n\nThe film is very much a character-driven piece, focusing almost entirely on Julia. The 30s setting and atmosphere is splendidly caught thanks to the excellent art direction, costume and makeup. The score contributes well. Overall director Szabó does a good job. However, the casting of Shaun Evans as Julia's young American lover felt slightly awkward. Of the supporting cast, Jeremy Irons, Michael Gambon, Juliet Stevenson and Lucy Punch do a delightful job. \n\nBut what would 'Being Julia' be without Annette Bening who performs all guns blazing delivering another tour du force performance. She is a real treat to watch and perhaps I'm not going too far in saying that this could even be used as a textbook in acting. Whether as the theatrical actress, the vulnerable woman seeking affection, the loving mother who has a fragile relationship with her son and even the employee who quietly appreciates Evie's support, Bening depicts each layer of her character with conviction. Bening owns the film."
