My copy has Sandra Bullock on the cover, which was why I bought the movie. She was in the movie for about 5 minutes of total screentime. She would most likely deny all involvement.\n\nIn short, there is no part of this movie worth seeing, except to laugh at how bad it sucks. Rent this to see the worst film ever made, bar none.",

Meanwhile, Connelly figures that Danny's friend Lisa would make a good target in order to get Danny and also his father.",
