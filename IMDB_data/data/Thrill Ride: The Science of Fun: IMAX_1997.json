        "reviewBody": "This 40-minute documentary really didn't spend too much time when it came to out-lining the evolution of the amusement park \"thrill ride\" from the past. No, it didn't.\n\nInstead it zoomed in at full-throttle on the high-tech, 3-D, motion-simulator rides of today that feature super-awesome CGI effects by such tech-wiz designers as Ben Stassen (this documentary's director).\n\nIn these state-of-the-art thrill rides (that use NASA technology) - \"Illusion\" is, of course, everything.\n\nSo (if you've got a big-screen TV set) - Buckle up, sit back, and hold onto your seats for a total adrenaline rush on the ultimate, amusement park, thrill ride of them all.\n\n*Note* - The one thing that seriously marred this documentary was the irritating \"old miner\" character who repeatedly popped up in this otherwise entertaining presentation to offer his worthless and unwelcome remarks to the audience.",
