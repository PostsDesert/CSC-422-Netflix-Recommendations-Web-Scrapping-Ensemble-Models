It took me a long time to find it again but was very excited when I found it.\n\nOverall, Jane Seymour is the reason I saw the film and would gladly watch it again. Her performance is great and never gets old. She did an amazing job with her role as the character slowly transforms throughout the film. From the start to the end the character growth and development is amazing.\n\nThe quality of the filming is on the lower end and perhaps there's a few scenes that are little cringe worthy, but the heart touching story makes up for it. The movie is basically about a woman and boy being thrown together and how they heal their wounds and overcome challenges together.",
