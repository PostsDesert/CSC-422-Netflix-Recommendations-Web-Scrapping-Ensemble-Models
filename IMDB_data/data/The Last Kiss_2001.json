        "reviewBody": "Good for Gabrielle Muccino, who wrote and directed this film!. A very good film. The user comment I read in this board mentioned whether or not to take seriously the italian's temper or if the outbursts were meant to make people laugh. The answer (from my South-American Latin perspective) is...of course they were serious and very real!. We don't usually \"hide\" our feelings. If we feel angry, we show it! If we feel great, we show! When we laugh, we laugh out loud! When we love, we do it with passion! The film is very good. Martina Stella (the 18-yr old high school girl who falls in love with the 29-yr Marco) in her featured debut is very good, and simply delightful to watch, since she is actually very pretty and sexy. \n\nI saw this film on DVD in the same session along with \"Bella Martha\" (also written/directed by a woman, Sandra Nettelbeck, check it out). Even when the latter is superior, \"L'ultimo baccio\" (Italian for \"The Last Kiss\") is nevertheless a very good film. This film mixes a first-rate modern cinematography with what used to be called \"Italian realism\" of the 50s and 60s. The mix is great and works fine."
