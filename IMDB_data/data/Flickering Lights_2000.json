        "reviewBody": "Quite exceptional Danish genre hybrid from director Anders Thomas Jensen. It has a maturity and confidence about it that is rare and surreal comedic aspects that reminded me of the wonderful ANTONIA'S LINE.\n\nFour emotionally unstable criminals, led by Torkild, commit a robbery to repay a large debt to The Eskimo, a violent, murderous thug. Instead of delivering the loot, the men flee to the countryside where they begin a new life.\n\nA threadbare synopsis does no justice to this wonderfully rich and magical film which expertly blends brutal violence, the blackest of humour and Roald Dahl-style childhood flashbacks to tell a fascinating, highly original story.\n\nThe characterizations are brilliant and the producers deserve a medal for having the courage to attempt a piece so violent (at times) and so utterly human.\n\nAlthough all performances are wonderful, a special mention must go to Ole Thestrup who plays local game hunter Alfred. His reaction to an offer of firearms in exchange for the life of his cow is priceless.\n\nAn absolute winner and a perceptive reflection on happiness, love, friendship and identity.",
