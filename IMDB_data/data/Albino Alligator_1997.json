There are just to many great and known actors in this movie and sadly not enough screen time for every one of them. But this movie has other things to offer; besides the good photography, the nice music and a strong cast it draws its energy from the script that has some great moment(albino aligator), but somehow fails to deliver in the end. \"Albino Aligator\" will appeal to those who like a dark crime movie but is just to plain to be something more. 6/10",
