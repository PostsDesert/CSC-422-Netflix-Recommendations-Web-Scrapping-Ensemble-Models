        "reviewBody": "Ordinary decent Criminal is an above average irish cops v robbers story about a charming criminal played by Kevin spacey who masterminds robbery's and who is always one step ahead of the Police. I'm not sure why Kevin Spacey took the lead role in this film, it is certainly no Usual Suspects but it does have the slight feel of it. You cant help but like Spacey's character, he is an Irishman who dislikes the church and the IRA and that is a breath of fresh air for feature film made in the republic. While this film is very watchable you cant help feel it is a little like a feature length version of an episode of Minder. 7 out of 10",
