        "reviewBody": "When the worst thing the drill instructor can call the new recruits at boot camp is \"Meatheads\", you know that the movie is pulling its punches. Not that I thought that about \"Battle Cry\" when I saw it at the age of nine in 1956 at the movies, then I lapped up every minute of this film devoted to those most cinematic of warriors - the US Marines.\n\nThe years have not been kind to \"Battle Cry\". It has dated in a way that \"From Here to Eternity\" has not. However it seems that many WW2 veterans like this film. They seem less critical of it than younger reviewers, and it's hard to argue with people who actually lived it rather than viewed it. To be honest, \"Battle Cry\" seems more truthful to the spirit of the marines of WW2 than a movie such as \"Windtalkers\" with all its gore and false heroics.\n\nLeon Uris wrote the novel based on his experiences with the marines during the war. It contained passages that were thrilling, funny and outrageous. The book's description of boot camp and the lustiness of the marines pulled no punches at all. But 1950's censorship made the movie a different matter.\n\nThe story follows a group of marines from the time they head to boot camp until their return from battle in the Pacific. So many characters are introduced that some of them emerge as overly familiar stereotypes, but Tab Hunter and Aldo Ray hold their own. Although James Whitmore's performance as Mac, the master sergeant, is convincing, his narration often comes across as trite and intrusive.\n\nThe movie concentrated as much on the encounters in the bedroom as on the battlefield, split evenly between the women the boys leave behind and the ones they find on their way to war with Nancy Olsen giving the strongest performance as the New Zealand widow who falls in love with Aldo Ray's character. \n\nThe movie becomes more focused when the recruits pass through boot camp and join the battalion that takes them to war. Van Heflin as Major Huxley, the commanding officer, gives the standout performance in this film, providing the right combination of toughness and compassion as the professional given the job of moulding boys into marines. His performance goes a long way towards counteracting the negatives in \"Battle Cry\".\n\nThe film's best sequence begins when Huxley pushes his men to outperform another battalion in a gruelling cross-country hike in New Zealand. After reaching their destination, he decides to do the return journey as well, pushing the men to their limits. When it seems they can't continue, the other battalion passes them on their way back mounted on trucks. The sight galvanises Huxley's men and resentment turns to pride as they march on bloodied feet back to camp. \"When we hit that camp gate, let's give 'em a look at the best outfit in the Corps\", exhorts Huxley as his men swing past to the accompaniment of Max Steiner's rousing score. \n\nUnlike music for war films of the last 30 years or so, which invariably play to the pathos and tragedy of war, Steiner went for the glory. Steiner's original marching song, \"Honey Babe\", provides an enduring memory of the film.\n\n\"Battle Cry\" delivers its major battle at the end. The landing on Saipan is well staged if somewhat confusing, but it leads to an emotional ending as the surviving marines return home.\n\nThe success of \"Battle Cry\" indicated that audiences of the day needed the reassurance of some core values: honour, duty, patriotism and sacrifice. \"Battle Cry\" over-delivered on those qualities. Vietnam was still ten years away, and then the generation brought up on movies like this would face some harsh realities of their own.\n\nIt is difficult to recommend \"Battle Cry\" to a broad audience today. But with that said, it does boast a number of fine performances and a sequence or two that stays in the memory.",
