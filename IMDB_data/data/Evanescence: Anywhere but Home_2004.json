        "reviewBody": "Evanescence is probably (or certainly) the best group that has recent arisen. This concert in Paris is excellent, with a vibrating Amy Lee singing all the successful songs of their recent album. Unfortunately the frantic edition of the images makes impossible to see the live performance of the band, since the images changes in such a frequency that the viewer is not able to watch the group on the stage. Further, the DVD was released without subtitles of the lyrics, showing the usual lack of respect of Sony with Brazilian costumers. Evanescence and their fans deserved a better director and distributor of their DVD. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Evanescence: Anywhere But Home\"",
