I mean, this is one of those films that you don't understand at all, but you watch fascinated, and you know that in the end it will all come together and make sense. However, that didn't happen. After a half hour of bizarre, freaky dream sequences and lots and lots of spanking, I was no more enlightened than I was at the beginning. I mean, what was Todd Haynes trying to say? That a little 6 year old boy obsessed with an old \"Lucy\"-esque sitcom has a spanking fetish? I'm sorry, I saw \"Velvet Goldmine\" also, and I didn't get that either. Maybe Todd Haynes and I are just not clicking. Also, where was Harriet Sansom Harris? The credits state she plays Steven's mother... Well, I am sorry, but that is NOT Har."
