        "reviewBody": "This is the true story of the rise of the Wailers told by themselves. This film is an intimate look at the roots of a spiritual and musical revolution that would soon change the face of popular music and the hearts and minds of struggling people all over the Earth. It is raw and pure, no glitz and glamor. It was presented that way so that its true audience could benefit from seeing it as close as possible to the way it was meant to be when the recordings were made in the 70's, and though all of the footage could not be recovered and Chris Blackwell refused to let his ex partner and co-founder of Island Records, Esther Anderson use the Wailers music for the score and soundtrack, it non the less shines like a beacon of light, guiding a new underground generation eager to change the current condition of the planet for the better in these revolutionary times. Watch it and be inspired to \"Get up Stand up\" as you learn the truth behind the writing of this Global anthem for freedom! Much is owed to Esther, Bob, Peter, Bunny, Family Man and the rest of the Wailers for being the artist visionaries that lead the way and still continue to do so today. The Rastaman Vibration is positive!",
