        "reviewBody": "This monster flop has an interesting story outline filled with garbage. The aliens have weaknesses that make even the non-rocket scientist in the audience wonder \"how did these guys survive long enough to conquer anyone?\" The next question I found myself asking is this, \"How long would certain things (books, computer-dependent machinery, combustion engines) last and still be of any use to anyone?\" Too many things you see in the movie are simply beyond belief. But this is science fiction you say? Of course. The point is that the basic story could have been told without any of these ridiculous questions bugging the viewer if the people making it had just thought things out for an hour or two. I understand that suspension of belief is a requirement of sci-fi fans but you have to limit it to just what is necessary to tell the story you are trying to tell.",
