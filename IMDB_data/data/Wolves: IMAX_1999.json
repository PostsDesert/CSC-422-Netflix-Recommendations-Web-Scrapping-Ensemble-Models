        "reviewBody": "This is a great short (40 minute), but very educational documentary on the history of wolves, their relationship with the native peoples of North America, & about their place in nature. I applaud the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) for putting this out. Yes, some scenes did contain captive wolves, but from what I saw in the video, it was stated out-front and made known that the wolf/wolves in a particular scene were captive. This video looks at both sides of the great wolf debate, & shares comments & views from people on both sides. It also contained cool footage of Natives dressing up & doing tribal dances. This video also explored the links between wolves, bison, & Native Americans; as well as white man's reasoning behind their determination to eliminate bison & wolves from the landscape. Overall, I would highly recommend this video, & believe it was a very well thought-out & balanced video. Again, job well done, NWF! p.s. The movie is a bit choppy in places, but I am guessing that is due to it being an online video. I do not know for sure, but I bet if you bought a DVD of this video & played it, there wouldn't be any choppiness.",
