        "reviewBody": "Based apparently on a true story of some All-American Lunatic going off on his own to hunt down and kill Bin Laden. There are several problems, one being that he travels to Pakistan although Bin Laden was in Afghanistan at the time. Oh well. I watched the first half of this film and thought it was pretty funny. The following evening I watched the second half and was incredulous at the fact that I had enjoyed the first part. This is because, half way through, it seems that the budget ran out and so, off he goes to \"Pakistan\" which I don't think was actually Pakistan. All the things that happen in \"Pakistan\" simply aren't believable. A white American guy goes wandering about Pakistan and isn't killed or kidnapped? Oh yeah sure. I think not. During the second half, Cage's overacting, which was merely an annoyance earlier, becomes so damned annoying that it required an effort of fortitude to sit and watch the entire piece of rubbish to the end, hoping that somehow, it would redeem itself with a wonderful ending. Let me disabuse you of that idea: No it doesn't."
