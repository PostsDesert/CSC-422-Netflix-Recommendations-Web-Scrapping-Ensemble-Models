        "reviewBody": "From the film industry which releases the largest number of movies in the world (more than Hollywood can even dream!), Mr. India was the perfect mix of dreams and reality. On the one hand is Arun, the caretaker of orphans, trying to have a living for everyone out of his non-existent income, and on the other is Mocambo (or Mogambo), the villain who wants to destroy India and take over control.\n\nThings change for Arun when he discovers a secret to become invisible. The magic band does wonders for his love life and comes in handy to do good for the humanity.. fighting the bad guys and ultimately saving the world!\n\nMr. India can be described as the 'Indian twist' to 'The Invisible Man', where the hero can never do anything bad. Shekhar Kapoor (The Director) has done a good job in mixing adventure, comedy, drama and romance, while retaining the original flavor of the 'good old' Indian film musical. Overall, a delight to watch!"
