        "reviewBody": "America' love affair with Sidney Poitier, which reached its peak in the 60s, resulted in the need for star vehicles for the actor. One such piece was based on a story conceived by Poitier. Called, \"For Love of Ivy,\" it cast the charismatic actor in a role in which he could wear the latest fashions--slickly tailored suits, sweaters, tuxes, and the like. His female costar, Abbey Lincoln likewise dresses in a varied and stylish wardrobe, looking quite pert and attractive.\n\nThe two seem to enjoy their little romantic romp in a lightweight domestic comedy, supported by Beau Bridges and Carroll O'Connor. Too bad the script tends to become a bit limp about midpoint, and never quite regains its zip.\n\n The movie plays better in home video format, where one can lounge back and relax in home surroundings, rather than in the more formal setting of the theater. Then the proceedings become a bit sluggish, it helps to be comfortable. Still, it's fun watching these attractive performers engage in their comedic entanglements, in a brightly designed production, and to a Quincy Jones score.",
