        "reviewBody": "I enjoyed watching \"Heartbreak Ridge\" but can also understand why the US Marines disavowed the film. Sure, it was quite jingoistic and patriotic but the language was NOT what the Marines want the public to hear...though in reality that sort of salty and politically incorrect dialog is exactly how the Marines I have known talk!\n\nThe film centers around an aging and somewhat anachronistic Gunnery Sergeant, Highway (Clint Eastwood). He's pretty much a tough-as- nails stereotype of a career military man....for good and for bad. His new assignment is a group of (unrealistic) Marines who are worthless jerks. He has to whip them into shape...or see them die should they ever go into combat.\n\nThe best way to describe the film is \"The Sands of Iwo Jima\" with a STRONG Rated-R bent. The language is often crude and offensive (especially in this politically correct era) and it is NOT a film for everyone. But it is enjoyable and well made...and Eastwood's character is one you won't soon forget.",
