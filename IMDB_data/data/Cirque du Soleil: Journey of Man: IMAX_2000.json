I have seen it 4 times so far.\n\nThis movie is very, very beautiful, very artistic, and the acts are no less than perfect in their execution. The sheer strength and control of the performers is awe inspiring.\n\nEverything about this movie is fantastically beautiful.\n\nThe production values are exceptional.\n\nThe photography is exceptional.\n\nThe settings are absolutely beautiful.\n\nThe costumes are beautiful and either extremely colorful or perfectly designed for the act they represent, for example the \"Living Statues\" painted to look like marble. They are all very imaginative.\n\nThe 3D effects make this movie alive in a way nothing else can. It leaves you wishing for more and more and more.\n\nI can find no faults with this movie, it is a must see movie especially in 3D, You leave the theatre feeling like you have seen a great work of art.\n\nI wish I could find this movie on 3D DVD. (Shutterglasses) I would add it to my collection."
