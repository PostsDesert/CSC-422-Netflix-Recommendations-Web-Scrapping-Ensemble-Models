        "reviewBody": "Here's the film that put Vincent Price on the horror map and redefined his career. His wonderfully unhinged performance as Professor Jarod is one that you should not miss. Price chews up the scenery and has a great time doing it. It would have been great to see it in 3D but I don't even know if you can get 3D on home video. But don't let that stop you from checking this one out. There is also a fine supporting cast including Frank Lovejoy, Phyllis Kirk, and a very dasterly Roy Roberts. Price plays a scuplter who takes his work just a little too seriously, especially after Roberts sets his wax mueseum on fire with Vinnie in it. The rest of the film focusses on Price's revenge, as it were. Also check out a very young Carolyn Jones (the future Morticia Adams). Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
