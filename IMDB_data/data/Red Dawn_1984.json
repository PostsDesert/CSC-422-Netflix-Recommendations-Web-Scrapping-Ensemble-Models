The plot is insane, acting over-the-top, but the historical commentary is amazing. People actually believed that such a thing as this was possible in the mid-80s, pre-Gorbachev. This is not \"low-level propaganda,\" its the most obvious pro-American movie I have EVER seen.\n\nOn the movie alone, the \"film\" shouldn't even rate. But as a Cold-War barometer, every interested person should see this to peer into the height of US-Soviet tensions."
