        "reviewBody": "I'd forgotten how much of an improvement season 2 was over it's predecessor until I purchased it just the other evening at Best Buy for an unbelievably low $6.99! What a breath of fresh air to be taken off the farm and out of the dead-end town of Altus! It's so fun to watch these two girls in action as they breeze into the lives of unsuspecting \"regular folk\" and turn their lives upside down. It's outrageous to watch what they're able to get away with, but it makes you wonder how much of it is actually orchestrated. While I love the show, one thing I find most annoying is the reactions of the people that invite Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie to perform these jobs. Come on, being surprised when they inevitably either screw the job up or blow it off altogether is like being surprised when Britney Spears shows her belly button - it's expected! I'm sorry, if I was a manager or proprietor of a business, as much as I adore these girls, if I valued my position as manager or my business I wouldn't allow them within 100 yards.\n\nI think people put way too much effort into being overly-critical of this show. It's fluffy and doesn't require any thought to watch it. It's pure, unadulterated fun, and it's a wonderful escape. Now, I like movies and television shows that make you think as much as the next guy, but, tell the truth, don't you just want to sit back sometimes and watch a show that doesn't require you to use any brain power at all?"
