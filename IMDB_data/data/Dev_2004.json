The film which depicts the tortures of muslims and hindus in India was really heartfelt and the film has a message which films seldomly give.\n\nThe mistreating of hindus and especially muslims in the film really makes your eyes water. The films gives a message of justice (Insaaf) and how people should fight for their right and freedom till there last breath. Amitabh is as always a terrific performer. Not to mention the film does have some emotion and controversy between Kareena and Fardeen but we have all seen that before and it's nothing new. This is the One FILM THAT shouldn't be left out!",
