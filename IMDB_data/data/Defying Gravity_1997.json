I do not find it far fetched that parents and friends can accept gay family and friends in their lives, while most frats are not so accepting, even in California.\n\nI think the subject of being gay, and in a frat, is an important issue. Guys at that age are still trying to grow into their sexuality, and may gays males at that point have not learn to accept their own sexually. Believe me, I know. As a matter of fact this is an important issue, because it not uncommon for those not accepting of their sexually, to take out their discomfort on others (i.e., gay bashing).\n\nThe movie has some touching moments, attractive actors, and I thought it was worth the 90 minute investment of my time. During the move not once did I have an urge to throw the remote, but then again, I have never been accused of being a drama queen."
