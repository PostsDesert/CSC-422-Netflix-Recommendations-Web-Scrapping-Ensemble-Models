Serendipity plays a large part in the transformation of the character's lives, especially the eccentric neighbor who terrifies Garr's kids. MacLaine keeps getting better and better with juicy roles like this one. It's light-hearted comedy, perfect for viewing at the end of the day with friends or family."
