        "reviewBody": "This anime is definitely fun to watch. It's about cute and popular teen girls who calls themselves \"Gals.\" I think that the leader, Ran, can be so funny but annoying at times. She doesn't do home works and other school stuff because her #1 priority is to hang at downtown Shibuya (not sure w/ spelling) and Karaoke, take pictures (neoprint), shop, and eat. It's gnarly like most of the time she's broke so she's always asking someone to buy her food. But in the end, she always gives these speeches to her friends which is supposed to be inspirational or something.\n\nSince she hangs at Shibuya, that is like her territory so when outsiders come, expect a big cat fight, especially with her enemy Mami. They love to fight and also the three over tanned girls, well mostly Ran just tells them off, not really enemies.\n\nWhat I really love is the way they talk and when the overly tanned small girl suddenly appears and explains the words they use and she says something like \"it's common knowledge for gals!\"\n\nI definitely recommend this if you love high school teen stuff w/ hyper characters."
