        "reviewBody": "Despite its silly title, which just refers to a childhood game, this is a profoundly serious movie about reconciliation.\n\nIt spans three generations of women, tormented by religion and mental breakdown. It explores three generations of mother-daughter relationships.\n\nThis would be a great movie for any child of an abusive mother.\n\nSiddalee, the Sandra Bullock character, gradually comes to understand her grandmother and mother and is thus gradually able to forgive them.\n\nIt is a frustrating movie. I found myself demanding the plot bound along with series of Hollywood contrivances, but it meanders and backtracks, tantalising then not delivering, much like real life.\n\nThe unbearably aching mood of reconciliation and nostalgia gradually develops, partly due to the long suffering, ever-loving Shep Walker (James Garner in a low-profile role quite unlike the ones he normally plays), and Connor (Angus Macfadyen), Siddalee's ever-patient Irish boyfriend.\n\nMaggie Smith is in it, reason enough to watch it.\n\nThe movie recreates the south in lush Technicolor over three generations, a visual feast.\n\nIf you are embarrassed to cry in public, make sure to watch this alone.",
