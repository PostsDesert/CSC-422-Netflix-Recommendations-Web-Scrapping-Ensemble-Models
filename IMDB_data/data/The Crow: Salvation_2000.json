        "reviewBody": "Now, the main problem with this film was the plot. It wasn't the actors, because they actually did a decent job. It wasn't the director, because it seemed like he knew what he was doing. It was the plot, plain and simple, the plot. First off, Corvis turning into the crow? No, didn't work for me. I didn't feel for these characters at all to tell the truth. The script didn't develop them as well as the first \"Crow\" did. So that was a major problem, I didn't feel that Corvis and Lauren had a strong love because they repeatedly showed the same loving scene between them. \"Was that their only romantic moment?\" I thought. See, the first \"Crow\" showed many memories of Shelly and Eric that were loving and touching, it showed how much they loved each other and it would never die.\n\nAnother problem I had was the make up was naturally on Corvis and didn't give any depth to his anger on the murder of his girlfriend. Kirsten Dunst seemed really out of place and was just another copy off of Sarah from the first \"Crow\". The villains, they were not that disturbing.\n\nEverything just didn't go in depth enough for me to care. For the \"Crow\" fans, I would recommend to complete the trilogy. But to other movie fans looking for a good rent, forget it.\n\n5/10",
