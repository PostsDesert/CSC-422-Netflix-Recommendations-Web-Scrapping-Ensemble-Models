My favorite character was the French girl, Crapes Suzette. I also liked Ginger Snap and Angel Cake, who are more major in the series. The animation is good, and they teach good morals as well. The songs are catchy and fun, and there is a wide variety of bright, fruity colors. I remember when the new series, Berry Bitty Adventures came out, I was really angry. But after watching some episodes, I began to like that one too. But this will always be my favorite. 10/10.",
