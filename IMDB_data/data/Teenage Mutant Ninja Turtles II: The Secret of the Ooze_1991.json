Paige Turco made a better April than Judith Hoag (and what a cool apartment April has!) and Ernie Reyes Jr. (whatever happened to him?) is a lot of fun to watch too. What WAS the secret of the ooze? I haven't seen the film in years!\n\nRe: Vanilla Ice. Yes, his very presence is laughable, let alone his \"performance\". But in his defense, he's less embarrassing here than in 1991's other blockbuster smash hit, Cool As Ice!"
