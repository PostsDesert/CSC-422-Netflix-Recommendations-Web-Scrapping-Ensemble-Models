A movie that has a good performance from Chow, some excellent, but nonsensical action sequences, and drive that keeps you watching to the end even though there's a point about half way in when the film stops making any sense what so ever. To be honest the film is close to being a complete and utter mess, but at the same time you can't help but watch because you keep hoping that the film will make sense at some point. It never does. Rationally I should hate the film, but there is there are a couple of things that make it intriguing, the fact that Chow fights some zombies during the later part of the film, something I never thought I'd see in one of his films, that make me begrudging like its incomprehensibility. I can't really recommend it as such, but those who want to see an amusing bit of Hong Kong Nonsense will have a good time.",
