I've seen a lot of hk movies like this one, some arent as good, if you want to see an older classic, i reccommend \"Hard Boiled\" with Chow yun-fat\n\nThis movie is about a cop who gets assigned an undercover case working for the triad, until he can get enough evidence to bust them. What insues is a battle between the triads/rival bosses and the police. Its a good movie , i only wish i could have seen the end of it, if your planning to have a Hong Kong movie weekend, throw this one in.",
