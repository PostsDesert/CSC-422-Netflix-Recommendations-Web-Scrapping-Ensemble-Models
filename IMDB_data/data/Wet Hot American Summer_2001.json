But this is very much what its like at camp. Sometimes you just sit around and talk about funny stuff that is just fun to do to. You don't always have to be doing stuff. Some of my favourite memories about camp are just from meeting different people (some weird) and talking about funny stiff. This is what this film is all the weird funny stuff that happens at camp.",
