Its a rock documentary, so from technical, editing, ect perspective it has issues, but that's not the point imho. Lots of great concert footage and Discussion with the original 3 members. Extremely exciting to watch( from a guy that grew up with these guys). This is a chance to see more of the band. Not too many guys are around 50 years and able to play together at this level. Glad to see young people appreciate this band. Wonderful doc that i am glad was made! So, I rate a 10 to compensate for all the trolls that gave a 1 rating ;) Now, lets get Gilmour and Waters together for a tour! That would really bring out the trolls..haha",
