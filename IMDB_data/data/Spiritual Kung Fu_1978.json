        "reviewBody": "Okay, so it's basically a crappy chopsocky movie. There are perhaps hints of Jackie Chan's unparalleled skill and comic brilliance, but not a whole lot more. The action is pretty run of the mill for the period. However, the dubbing in this film makes it pretty entertaining at points, my favorite part being the interaction between Jackie and the the young woman, who is the first girl his character has ever seen. After flirting with her, he tries to show off some of the 5-style fist he's been learning from the white-faced ballerina ghosts (that's a whole other story, but also pretty amusing). Jackie goes into a stance, and the following dialogue ensues: Girl(coy): \"What's that?\" Jackie(smug): \"Oh, you wouldn't know that. That's the famous crane style.\" Girl(bitchy): \"Really? Well, you look like a teapot. Pouring tea!\" Jackie(indignant): \"You insult my style?! I'll show you!\"\n\nThey fight, and she defeats him. After consulting with the ballerina ghosts, Jackie waits for a rematch:\n\nJackie(sly): \"I've been waiting for you all morning.\" Girl(chipper): \"Why? To get beat?\" Jackie(confident): \"I won't get beat. But you will.\"\n\nHe then proceeds to mop the floor with her; poking her in the head with his crane beak/fist, he goads, \"A teapot? Is that right?!\"\n\nIf you found that at all funny, then maybe it's worth checking out. For some reason I thought it was amusing. But you'd better be a pretty serious Jackie Chan fan, 'cause there isn't much else there."
