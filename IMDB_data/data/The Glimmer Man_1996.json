Like many comments, good fight sequences - I particularly liked his answering of the phone at the restaurant saying how long it would be closed for restoration. Bit like Schwarzenegger's humour in the earlier action films - although that tended to be self-deprecating.\n\nBut the one I like here is Brian Cox. One of the most versatile actors around. Pity about his hand and foot, but so much for withstanding extended interrogation - must have flunked that class at the \"farm\".\n\nAs the films went on I wonder just how the ever thickening girth of Seagal affected his movement?. Never mind, it's entertainment!.",
