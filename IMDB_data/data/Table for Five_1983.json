        "reviewBody": "TABLE FOR FIVE is a superior example of overlooked filmmaking. The story is poignant and compelling, Jon Voight ia terrific in a role prior to his character stage. His portrayal of a far from perfect father, not wholeheartedly trying to change his demeanor, is realistic and sensitive. Richard Crenna, far from the Walter Denton of \"Our Miss Brooks\" days, gives an excellent performance as a less charismatic, but especially decent man in a difficult position. The three child actors are equally empathetic and effective. This is a type of movie some critics mistakenly dismiss, but the rest of us appreciate..",
