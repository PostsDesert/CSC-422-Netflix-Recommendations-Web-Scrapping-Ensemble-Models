This story is about kick ass warriors Mugen and Jin and a funny female Fuu on a journey to the find the samurai \"who smells of sunflowers\" the catch is Mugen and Jin don't really like each other very much but made a deal with Fuu that they would not fight each other till they find the samurai \"who smells of sunflowers\" This is what sets up the show to be very entertaining the show is often hilarious and than thrilling with kick ass sword fights etc. I'm not a huge hip-hop fan but damn it works its outstanding for this show the music is awesome...\n\nOverall this is a must own DVD go buy it right now it is worth every cent I can't wait to get this whole set! 10/10"
