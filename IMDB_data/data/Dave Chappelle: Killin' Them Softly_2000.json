He comments on everything from racism to the subtle differences between men and women in this hilarious stand-up routine. His line delivery, content, EVERYTHING is absolutely perfect, and I honest can say this is the funniest show/movie/stand-up session I have ever seen. Not only is he incredibly funny, but also intelligent, as he dabbles in a few situations in politics, scandals, and everything in between. Not only do I agree with this, but everyone who I know saw this agree with me, that this is without a doubt a milestone in comedy, period. Its gut-bustin, unrelenting, and just plain fun. Just one thing...make sure you see it with a group of people. This already comic gem will get even better. SEE IT ASAP!!!"
