The comedy both verbal and visual are all funny. And the voice acting is top notch with great voice actors like Tom Kenny, Rob Paulson, and more doing great performances. The greatest part of the movie to me is that Joseph Barbera helped make the movie when he was 95 years old. 95!!! And that since William Hanna passed away a few years prior, Joseph had to work on this movie without his partner and to think this is as great as it is is fantastic. I highly recommend it.",
