I love the talents of Tara Strong as Kitty and Cree Summer as the villainess Catnip. My favorite episodes are the ones where Kitty plays a princess and Tuxedo Sam the Penguin is the prince in fairy tales like \"Sleeping Beauty,\" \"Cinderella,\" and such; those stories are my favorites. It's like I said, even though I am 24 years old, I still love to read fairy stories. So anyway, I love this Hello Kitty TV series and the \"Hello Kitty and Friends\" TV series.",
