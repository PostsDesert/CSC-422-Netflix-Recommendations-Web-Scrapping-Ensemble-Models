        "reviewBody": "A real family tear jerker, with great amounts of comedy thrown in for good measure. Peter Falk takes his grandson on a journey back through his own imagination and allows him and his own son to follow suit. This movie is mainly about family issues and how in the end our own mortality is what will make you want to resolve them. Father and son (Tim Daly and Josh Hutcherson) realise what it is to stay in tune with your own imagination and not lose yourself in the material trappings of the modern world. It really is a much deeper movie than it lets on. Although a TV movie from 2003, this came out on DVD last year, and looks very much like a motion picture. I recommend it to all. It is a joy to see Peter Falk acting so well - and like somebody mentioned - it seems like an extension of his role in the Princess Bride. I'll be watching this again at the weekend :) \n\nPeter",
