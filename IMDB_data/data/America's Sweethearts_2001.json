I have always enjoyed it very much for it's wit and for the critical undertone it takes about how relationships function is Hollywood )something that is easily capitalized upon with today's celebrities). Really, the movie mocks the holllywood genre in general, which I find to be incredibly amusing! The performances are also very good. Billy Crystal, John Cuzsack, Julia Roberts, and Catherine Zeta Jones all play their roles in a very believable way. The dialogue is witty and engaging. I highly recommend it for a good laugh and a decent romantic comedy!",
