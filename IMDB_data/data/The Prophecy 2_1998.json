        "reviewBody": "The 1998 sequel to the 1995 movie \"The Prophecy\" was certainly watchable and enjoyable, however it just wasn't quite as intense as the first movie. But still, it makes for a good movie, nonetheless.\n\n\"The Prophecy II\" continues on with the story of Gabriel, and actually includes a more clear and drawn out prophecy this time, whereas the first movie was more hesitant about such a thing - oddly enough.\n\nSimilar to the first movie, \"The Prophecy II\" boasts a rather impressive set of casted actors and actresses. And it is nice to see Christopher Walken return to reprise the role as Gabriel. It was a shame that they didn't have Elias Koteas return to the role as Thomas, despite it being a small part in \"The Prophecy II\". But they had Bruce Abbott - from the \"Reanimator\" movies - step in and fill out his shoes, and he does have somewhat of an resemblance to Elias Koteas for sure. \"The Prophecy II\" also have some good performances by Tom Towles, Brittany Murphy and Eric Roberts.\n\nThere was a good pacing to the storyline told in \"The Prophecy II\", however the storyline felt a little bit rushed at times and as if director Greg Spence just wanted to get the movie finished. Personally, I felt there were parts of the movie that were just skimmed across without going into depth with the aspects of the movie, and that was a shame.\n\nAll in all, \"The Prophecy II\" is a worthy sequel to the 1995 \"The Prophecy\" movie for sure.",
