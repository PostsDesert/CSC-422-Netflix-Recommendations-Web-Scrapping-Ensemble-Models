        "reviewBody": "I didn't like this \"Vision Shared\" because it's very different from the CD of the same name which I had enjoyed for years. First of all, this is not a concert film, but rather a compilation of clips of various entertainers in separate settings singing some of the songs on the CD. The trouble is that so many of the songs are talked over by the commentators that you can't enjoy the singing. A prime example of this is the beautiful \"Hobo's Lullaby\" that is performed by Emmilou Harris. Just as she gets into it, the narrator starts another round of commentary totally destroying the song. This happens throughout the documentary. Perhaps it is better for you if you aren't familiar with the famed CD of the same name. It might just make you want to go out and buy it after seeing this.",
