        "reviewBody": "The latest version of longtime blues-rock band concert is a long one, featuring tons of music. Everyone from the original group was gone, except Greg Allman. It is still a solid band with the same it always had. Derek Trucks and Warren Haynes both fill in nicely on guitar work. \n\nThe only problem I found was the same thing I found with all the Allman DVD concerts - too much. Most of it is loud and many of the songs sound the same in concert. They don't vary the music enough and after awhile, the faster material just begins to sound like noise. I don't know why I get suckered into buying these guys' DVDs all the time because they just aren't that great. As I said, too much of it just sounds the same. This was an expensive DVD, too. Since they aren't animated, and the lighting is nothing special, you're better off just enjoying the group on CD.",
