        "reviewBody": "\"Tess McGill\" (Melanie Griffith) is a hard-working woman who is trying to climb the corporate ladder but can't seem to get anybody to give her a fair chance. So after being fired from her current position at a Wall Street investment firm for refusing to sleep with her boss's friend she is assigned to work as a secretary for a female business executive named \"Katherine Parker\" (Sigourney Weaver). At first, Tess likes her new situation as Katherine promises to mentor her so that she can achieve her goals. However, her admiration for her new boss changes when Tess learns that Katherine has recently stolen one of her ideas and is in the process of promoting it as her own. So when Katherine is temporarily side-lined with a broken leg Tess decides to take matters into her own hands and advance the idea on her own. And to do that she turns to an investment broker named \"Jack Trainer\" (Harrison Ford) who is skilled in the art of finance and can help her close the deal. What she doesn't count on is the budding romance between them-or the fact that Jack just happens to be Katherine's boyfriend. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I liked the chemistry between Melanie Griffith and Harrison Ford and thought that both of them performed their roles in an excellent manner. Likewise, Sigourney Weaver was equally effective as the vicious boss from hell that believes that rules and ethics don't apply in her case. Be that as it may, I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a romantic-comedy of this type and have rated it accordingly. Above average.",
