Little if anything of interest through entire jumble of a movie. Didn't care for or feel interest in any character or interaction this movie had to offer. Would clearly appeal to those who found artistic merit, as well enjoyable controversy, in the Virgin Mary covered in Dung. Roger Ebert is quoted as saying that he saw the movie three times. I'm guessing it's because he fell asleep during the first two viewings."
