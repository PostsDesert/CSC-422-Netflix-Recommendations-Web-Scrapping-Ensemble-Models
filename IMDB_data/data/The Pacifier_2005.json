The reason why I watched it was because Lauren Graham was in it and I wanted to see how her pairing worked with Diesel. There was no chemistry (and I mostly blame Diesel as he's hardly ever had chemistry with any of his co-star). The film does have its few funny moments. Brad Garrett makes a few appearances and his wrestling suit was hilarious. Kids might love the film. Diesel fans might love it because he's in it. I don't. For me it's forgettable and certainly better forgotten."
