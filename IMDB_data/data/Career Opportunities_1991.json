The guy stumbles into a girl hiding inside and the two have some harmless fun till a couple of robbers show up (sound familiar). There are maybe 2 or 3 laughs in this movie, but many of the 81 minutes majorly suck. Hughes great insights from the 80s are absent here, and Whaley just comes across dull. Conellys gorgeous yes, which is the only thing to keep male viewers going with all that cleavage, but others will doze off. Thought Id never say it, but Hughes has delivered his worst here. Ick."
