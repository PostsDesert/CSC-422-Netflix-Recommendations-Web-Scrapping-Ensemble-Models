        "reviewBody": "Having been a fan of this show since I first saw it on BBC 2 in 1999, I sat down to watch PKW with some nervousness, Farscape's characters are like a family in a way. A family who you visited every week, you shared their highs and lows, their loves and hates.\n\nWould Peacekeeper Wars be faithful to the series? Or would it be a hodge podge of ideas and scenes with none of the old humanity?\n\nHappily my fears were unjustified. PKW grabs you by the throat and does not let go.\n\nThe acting was, as usual, superb with believable characters, The bad guys do not resort to the clich√© of being bad for the sake of it. Everyone has their reasons for doing what they do.\n\nThe effects were amazing and the story line is a roller coaster ride.\n\nAdmittedly, there are times when the compressed season 5 storyline jars. But this is forgivable.\n\nThe rumour at the time of filming was that the mini series used up all the available squibs in Australia. After seeing the battle scenes, you realize why!\n\nAll in all, a good ending to this part of the story while still leaving a way to make more. \n\nLet's hope Moya keeps flying and we visit her crew in the future.\n\n;-)",
