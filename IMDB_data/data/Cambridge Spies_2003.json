        "reviewBody": "While not unhistorical, this is a very garbled and misleading presentation of the spies in question. Presumably, historical truth is sacrificed for dramatic reasons. But Cambridge Spies doesn't manage to rise to the level of drama. It's melodrama. There are moments when, if you turn off the sound, you'd swear you were watching a not very good silent movie: sentimental and over-wrought. The Guernica scene is a case in point; Guy Burgess, emoting in the rain, lamenting the death of Julian Bell is another. Rather a waste of acting talent. The main characters in this effort have each done other work that displays their talents to much better effect.",
