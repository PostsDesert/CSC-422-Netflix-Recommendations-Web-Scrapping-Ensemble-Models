        "reviewBody": "So thinks Barbara Stanwyck in \"Crime of Passion,\" a 1957 film also starring Sterling Hayden and Raymond Burr. Stanwyck is newspaper woman Kathy Ferguson who, in the beginning, is going after the story of a crime being investigated by Doyle and Alidos (Hayden and Royal Dano). Dano gives the newsroom a speech on the idea of \"let us do our job\" and Stanwyck is the only one who speaks up, stating, \"And we're trying to do our jobs.\" Alidos' reply is a killer: \"You should be home making dinner for your husband.\" Do you love it? Doyle and Kathy fall in love and get married a little too soon after they meet. Kathy, a woman who craves excitement and new adventures in life, is stuck with a bunch of vapid women she can't tolerate. Making things worse, her husband is a gentle and loving man but he has no ambition. And she's bored out of her skull. Of course, now that she's married, there's no question of her working. In an effort to help him, Kathy cultivates a friendship with the wife (Fay Wray) of Police Inspector Pope (Burr) and then has a flirtation with the inspector himself. It leads to problems (that's putting it mildly).\n\nStanwyck is terrific in a difficult role, that of a woman with more going on internally than even she knew; Burr does a good job as a hard-nosed, cold police inspector. Sterling Hayden has never been a favorite of mine. To me he always comes off as a dufus. In \"Crime of Passion,\" he's excellent as a good man whose only ambition is to be happy and spend time with his wife. Alas, his wife didn't share his dream.\n\nThis is a small movie, probably a B, directed by Gerd Oswald that is shot in black and white, probably reflective of what people were seeing on television by then. The twists and turns will keep the viewer off-balance and interested. not to mention the pervasive '50s attitudes toward women.",
