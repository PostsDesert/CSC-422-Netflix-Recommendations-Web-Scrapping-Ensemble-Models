        "reviewBody": "I think that this movie had to be similar to the excellent low-budget film \"Pizza, Birra, Faso\", because they have the same theme (marginal boys trying to survive), but this one did not completely satisfy my expectations. Why is that?: First, because is not so realistic as the other; second, because there are some things in the plot that I think that didn´t work (eg: the dreams that one of the boys had with a girl - they are totally out of context); Finally because the movie´s ending is very excessive. Despite what I have written, it´s a limited but interesting film, and a good attempt at an original movie. I think it's worth a look. I give this title a 6.5 out of 10.",
