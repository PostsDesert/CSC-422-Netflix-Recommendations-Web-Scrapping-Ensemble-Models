Although I still have to see the new film, this take of Piano Lesson was a nice surprise. Funny, smart, touching - it had it all. The storyline is great, evolving just at the right pace, without being too expected (as in Boring) or too melodramatic (as in Not my cup of tea). The plot has twists and turns, the characters are 3-D and interesting and the actors convincingly bring them to life. As I said - a very nice surprise for me, and I'm about to watch this all over again - this time with my boyfriend. I give it an easy 10 out of 10. Wonderful. >> Kim B. >> http://www.reviewsnest.com",
