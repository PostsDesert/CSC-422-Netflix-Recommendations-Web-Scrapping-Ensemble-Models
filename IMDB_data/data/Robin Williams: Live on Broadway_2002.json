Surprisingly though, the funniest moments come when Robin swears. And by god does he ever swear (check the quotes section to see what I mean). As for content, he does everything from improv funniness to jokes about Steve Irwin, Tiger Woods, sex with gorillas, politics and breast implants. This is the funniest thing I have ever seen. Definitely check this out.",
