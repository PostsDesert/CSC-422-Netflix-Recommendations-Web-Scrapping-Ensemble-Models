        "reviewBody": "(Attention: Following comments may contain information about any part of the story\")\n\n\"Fist of the north star\" was originally released in eastern Asia (1987). A strong anime movie and soon to come as series. This perfectionated piece of work was one of the most complete and solid art I have ever had a chance to study. All Characters followed their own way on the same path towards a goal I call love. There was honor, love, bravery and ignorance. Revenge, hunger and determination. All of them disclosed in their most pure way.\n\nEvery word was perfect and the result of generations of toil and thinking. That it was painted was not an obstacle but very helpful because you cannot find actors that can represent these solid characters in real.\n\n1995. Hollywood released a film version of \"Fist of the north star\" with real actors. This movie claims that it is based on the anime. The real facts are that this movie is disappointing and awakes fury and anger in every pure heart. Many characters are changed hiding behind the original \"names\" and some Zealous keycharacters are even removed. At this stage of censor (which I can't comprehend the reasons of) , main characters are shown as cowards and violators against the Jin and jang principles which the anime is based upon. This entire violated story has become a family affair with jelousy, superficial se*ual desires which in this case are against Asian, and even American standards.\n\nThe Scenography is bad and the actors are extremely weak. Love is displayed as something that has come out of a baywatch story.\n\nThis movie is not recommended before the study of the original anime work.\n\nFor an ignorant person, I guess that wouldn't make any difference."
