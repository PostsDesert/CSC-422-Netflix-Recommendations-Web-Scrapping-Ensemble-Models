One off-putting thing about it is a scene where a character gives a sort of \"war whoop\" while machine-gunning someone - what's weird is that it's one of the GOOD GUYS doing it. But one thing made me watch it. Like \"Brad the Lad\", I've always been mad about Lori \"Ice\" Fetrick. And as he says, she's very convincing in that villainous role (that smile of hers works in a role like that as much as any other way, and, needless to say, everything else about her). I just wish she'd gotten to wear the kind of skimpy clothes Kathleen Kinmont did in the previous movie. No offense to Lamas and Kinmont, but 5 stars for the movie, and 10 for her.",
