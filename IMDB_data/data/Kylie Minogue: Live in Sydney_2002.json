From the opening moments where she rises through the stage floor clad in metallic body armour through to the many costume and choreography changes, Kylie delights throughout. She addresses tunes, old and new, in this concert and never misses an opportunity to mock her much-maligned public persona. This show is mostly notable for the multitude of special lighting effects that both enhance and define Kylie's performances throughout the show. If you've never given yourself the chance to enjoy Miss Minogue's talent than this is certainly the place to start. Rent the DVD and love it! Come into her world..."
