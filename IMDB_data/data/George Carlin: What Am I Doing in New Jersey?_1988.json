Here, he brings politics into view with Ronald Reagan and his criminal gang, things to keep people alert with, people I can do without, and Cars and driving pt. 2 (continued from Carlin on Campus). I really enjoyed his bit on Cars and driving being a New Jerseyan and that here, he starts to show signs of anger brewing from his past (usually, Carlin just does bits on things we don't notice and stuff). Funny stuff, but not quite fully dandy. A+",
