        "reviewBody": "The Good: The DVD version has three soundtracks. A Dolby Stereo track which is of similar sound quality to the various CDs that have been released over the years. The second track is in Dolby 5.1, and it's a pretty good surround remix. And then there's the third track in DTS 5.1 format, which is the best of the lot. It packs a punch from all five speakers and will have the neighbors banging on the door telling you to turn it down! It's that good.\n\nThe Bad: While the soundtrack shines, the video quality ain't so good. Some of the earlier footage is a bit grainy, it's in the 4:3 aspect ratio, and most DVD players will probably try and stretch it into 16:9 making the Police look fat. If your TV has \"panoramic\" mode, then use it. It's unfortunate that all of the original video clips were shot in 4:3, but I suppose no one knew any better back then? \n\nThe Ugly: Some of those dance moves are shockers....but I suppose no one knew any better back then, either??",
