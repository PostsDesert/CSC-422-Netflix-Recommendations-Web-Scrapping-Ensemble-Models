The interpretation is brilliant, and has that old-fashioned taste of the 60s, even Paul is playing his old Hoffner bass from the Beatles era.\n\nUnfortunately Paul ain't got 20, so he can't twist and shout like he used to do in the true Cavern Club, and when he sings \"I saw her standing there\", we got those great remembers assuring that old times always were better.\n\nPaul, keep on rocking, every Beatles fan is waiting for your acting.",
