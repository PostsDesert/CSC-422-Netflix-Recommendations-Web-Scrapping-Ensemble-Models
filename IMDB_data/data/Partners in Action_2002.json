        "reviewBody": "Not terribly original in its basic plot, this film still managed to entertain me. Armand Assante delivers a solid performance, the major supporting roles are well handled, especially Douglas Smith's. There are enough fresh details in the story to make it work, and it tries hard to remain plausible. \"Scenery chewing\" over-the-top acting makes an appearance from time to time, perhaps in an effort to pump up the less inspired bits, or so it seemed to me. Blessedly, these moments were brief. As were the periods of subspace turbulence ... uh .. sorry, cinema verite camera shakiness. If you enjoy the \"hard-boiled ex-cop with heart of gold, in trouble\" thing (and who doesn't?), this film will deliver. Not the best, but it's got the goods.",
