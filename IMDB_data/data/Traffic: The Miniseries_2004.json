And in acceptance of this, despite the \"sure deals\" and \"assumed audience\" that USA had working for them, they have managed to develop a brilliant scheme that played out. \"Traffic\", in it's own right, is a beautifuly executed miniseries of it's own. And should be allowed to stand on those legs, despite it's legacy. For this is an issue that man has left unfounded,; and to be so humanistlicly illustrated, quite possibly more than it's predecesor. For this is a story about our own legacy's, our own weaknesses - which has managed to play it self out in of all places: Our Televisions.",
