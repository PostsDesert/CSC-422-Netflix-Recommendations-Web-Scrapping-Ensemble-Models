They attempted to build a 19th Century equivalent using black powder.What they built was a large-bore, muzzle-loading musket that fired from on top of the shooter's shoulder. No rocket, no explosive warhead.Their \"target\" was a Hollywood style special effect explosive that detonated with a satisfying Flash-Boom for the camera. All their targets are the same rigged fireworks. An hour's viewing wasted for special effects. Cancel this... thing... please!"
