The final scenes in the gas chamber are the most realistic i have ever seen of an execution. The movie uses real information supplied by The newsman who followed the case from the start and by Barbra Graham herself. After watching her in the gas chamber,it's very easy ro see why Susan Hayward won the Oscar for best actress."
