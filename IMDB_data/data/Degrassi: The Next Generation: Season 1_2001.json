My favorite characters are definitely Paige and JT. They add much humor to the show. The one thing I don't like is the fact that in the states, The-N edits the episodes. We didn't even get to see one of the episodes, because The-N thinks that the people of the states are too weak to handle a little maturity. Many of the shows do deal with mature topics, but we can handle them just fine, thank you. Anyway, if you don't watch Degrassi: The Next Generation, then you should start watching it!"
