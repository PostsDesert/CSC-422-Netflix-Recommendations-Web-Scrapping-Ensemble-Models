        "reviewBody": "Sorry to pose the question, since I have to say I don't know myself. This was easily the cleverest show I have seen. And it's the only TV comedy I know that is sometimes really fascinating.\n\nIn the episode where the broadcast is jammed by the Soviets, I found that along with the funny premise and its very funny execution (the stroboscopic image, the \"new mini-cam\", \"Uzbeks\"), there was a genuinely creepy vision of media under state control.\n\nBut it would give entirely the wrong impression to suggest that the show was ever preachy, even though it belittled the socially irresponsible from time to time. It was always exuberant fun.\n\nJust so everyone understands, this was the series made for NBC, not the original lower-budget (but very good) years, nor the following year on Cinemax, which I didn't see.\n\nUnfortunately I haven't seen any of them in over ten years. This is one of the very few things I would own on DVD if it were available.\n\n\"Battle of the PBS Stars\", \"Chariots of Eggs\", Guy Caballero forgetting to stay in his chair, the frightening lust of Edith Prickly, and of course \"Great White North\". They deserve to be preserved."
