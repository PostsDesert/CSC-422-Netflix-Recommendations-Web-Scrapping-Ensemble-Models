Don't get me wrong, this was very interesting and very well acted and all, nicely put together, and the ending was little twist that saved a lot.\n\nFew parts doesn't make any sense in the movie but that didn't bother me. It was lovely to watch the whole movie with huge interest for the ending.\n\nTruly worth of watch if you can handle thrillers and 80's style doesn't bother you.\n\nAnd for the last words, this was pretty original for a thriller.. legendary maybe. Now I got lost in nostalgic, enjoy!",
