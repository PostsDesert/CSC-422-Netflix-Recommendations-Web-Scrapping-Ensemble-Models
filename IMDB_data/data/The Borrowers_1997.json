This showed how far technology had come in films and now, of course, we see a lot more amazing special effects.\n\nIt was fun to view how these \"borrowers\" moved about, using ordinary household items to propel themselves around a normal-sized house. It's all pretty ingenious.\n\nJohn Goodman plays a cartoon-like role, a role that is generally funny to watch. The cast has a mixture of American and English actors, with a setting of 1940s Britain. I first saw this on VHS and then later on DVD, which was improvement not only video-wise, but audio, too, as it somehow went from mono to surround sound. This might be considered a kids movie but a lot of the humor is more adult-oriented.",
