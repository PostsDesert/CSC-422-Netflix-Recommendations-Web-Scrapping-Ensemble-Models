This is for the ones who used to listen to Guns n' Roses everyday and used to sing every lyrics by heart. Yes, HEART! This for those who just can't really believe it doesn't exist anymore. This is for the ones who hope the band comes back to the top one day, no matter how long it takes. In this video, that has recently become a DVD, we can see the band performing some of its best songs like \"Welcome to the Jungle\", \"Patience\", \"Don't Cry\" and \"November Rain\". Axl Rose, Slash, Duff McKagan, Gilby Clarke, Dizzy Reed, Matt Sorum and their supporting band show how good they were. We also miss Izzy Stradlin', who had left the band four months before.",
