I happened to catch it On Demand and wound up watching the first three episodes in one binge.\n\nIt's a good show. Yes, we can sit here and pick apart some of the acting or some of this or some of that, but some of these reviews are just asinine.\n\nHonestly, I think some people could save some time and just write \"I hate the military. I hate America. I hate God. I am going to bash this show, no matter what an no matter how ridiculously, unless it changes history to reflect my own personal narrative and wants\".\n\nIt has a \"Blackhawk Down\" feel to it. The character development is fairly well done, although not necessarily done in the conventional way.\n\nGrab a cold drink and a snack, sit down and enjoy the show. If you want an agenda driven, $$$$$$ heavy production, go watch a movie from the any major studio.",
