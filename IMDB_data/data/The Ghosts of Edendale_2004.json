The story itself has potential but the delivery is quite awkward.\n\nActing: First 15 minutes was nice because it's full of mystery then comes the awkward and cliche acting to the point it was too funny. I really laughed in the cinemas (not trying to insult) because of the awkwardness is so beyond my comprehension.\n\nYou can already tell who's the antagonist and what's going on without even thinking.\n\nImpact: No impact at all, even at the climax of the story gave me a laugh.\n\nSound: they use the \"horror\" sound too much to the point it doesn't scare the audience anymore or keep them on their toes.\n\nThe verdict: Story could've been better, Awkward delivery, acting and camera angles especially when they emphasize the antagonists.",
