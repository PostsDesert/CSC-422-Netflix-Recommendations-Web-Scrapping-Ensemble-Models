        "reviewBody": "No Spoilers here. One of my favorite 10 movies, and easily the best made for TV movie ever. Storm of the Century reaches the highest level of suspense of any movie I have ever seen. I have watched it 5 times now, and am amazed at how linear it is for its length. Not a minute is wasted.\n\nAs with every great film it is not for everyone, but keep in mind that no movie is rated above 9.0 here, and that some people will not like it because it was made for TV, is Stephen King, is long, isn't packed with CGI or gore, or isn't a comfortably predictable Hollywood story. Don't let the fact it isn't rated 8.0+ fool you-this is an outstanding movie.\n\nAbsolutely anti-Hollywood (I love it for that as well), this is much more like an independent film not trying to be artsy. Few big name stars, no wasted sub-plots to draw in general audiences, no special effects wedged awkwardly in, not packed with pretty people who cannot act or out-of-place one-liners. This is a pure horror/suspense movie.\n\nIf you want a movie you can predict the ending to within 10 minutes, or settle down comfortably to another familiar rehashed horror story, pass on this one-it is original, chilling, and as gripping and memorable as any movie you will see. Like any horror suspense movie, you won't get the full effect if you have it on at noon while surfing the net and chatting on the phone. I most closely would compare it to Silence of the Lambs or The Ring in tension and flow, but without the shock value. The tension and eeriness this movie creates is palpable.\n\nThis is not a slasher/gore movie, and you will get a chance to know the main characters of Little Tall Island, as well as see an original portrayal of antagonist Colm Feore (who perfectly nailed his role). Yes, Anthony Hopkins would have ALSO been great for this role, but I don't think better. If you are chilled by hearing \"I'm a Little Teapot, short and stout...\" afterwards, you'll be here posting great reviews as well.",
