        "reviewBody": "This movie had the potential to be incredible. It's the best stoner film yet, but there is more to it than just getting high and giggling. It's definitely not the thing to see if you're in the mood for something fun and uplifting, or something with tons of thrills and action. The metaphors in this movie are abundant. Are there annoying things in this movie? Yes, like the overdone puppetry. But the movie has enough to keep you entertained. I think it is still a reasonable film. It was really beyond over the top. This film is not as bad as they say. Heartfelt and riveting from the first frame to the last. 7 out of 10.",
