This one turned out to be the worst, with no substance, poor dialog, and an incredible lack of action. Passion is shown as something evil, to be avoided by all means. The scenes of fainting people everywhere are beyond the limits of stupidity. Some of the characters are beyond fantasy, as is the recurrent idea of coincidence against all odds. Having met friends who recently came from Havana, it is clear that the director avoided showing the miserable state of that city. It is hard to believe that this awful creation received any award ever. The only reason I give it a 3 out of 10 is out of respect for most of the main actors, who were pitifully wasted.",
