I am not surprised the actors from this movie have not gone on to do bigger and better things. Because, after watching this movie, you could see why. The direction is awful, the pace is slow. But, more than that, the description on the back of the box is VERY VERY misleading. Proceed with caution, and if you disregard this and decided to give it a try, I am so very sorry, because I know it's 120 mins of my life I would like back. C. McCormick, I hear, is actually considering doing more things. I am trying very hard not to hold this movie against her, it being her first film and all. But, believe me, it's hard. Still in the end, I left not really knowing what the movie was all about.",
