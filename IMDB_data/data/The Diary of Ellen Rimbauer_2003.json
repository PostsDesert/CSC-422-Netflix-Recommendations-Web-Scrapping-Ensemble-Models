        "reviewBody": "\"The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer\" is a prequel to the Mini-Series \"Rose Red\" (2002). The cinematography and the art direction are excellent, depicting Seattle in 1910 and a few years after. The cast is also great with good performances. However, the story is weak and disclosed in a very slow pace. The great mystery of the disappearances of women is never explained and there is no explanation about the evil entity that torments Ellen Rimbauer. In the end, \"The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer\" is a huge disappointment and never satisfies fans of horror, thriller, drama and romance genres. My vote is five.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"O Di√°rio de Ellen Rimbauer\" (\"The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer\")",
