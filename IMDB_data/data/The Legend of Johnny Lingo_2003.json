        "reviewBody": "That's not how I felt about it the first couple of times I watched it, but seeing it again recently, I realized: I really, really like this movie.\n\nYou need to see it several times.\n\nOkay, so Alvin Fitisemanu's acting is awful in this film.\n\nOkay, so it's a rolling commercial for Tahitian Noni Juice.\n\nOkay, so it's weighed down by its share of clich√©s, including one scene that appeared to have been stolen directly from Chicken Run.\n\nIn the end, I just don't care. In the end, I am overcome by the story, the music and the characters in this film. I LIKE Johnny Lingo, I LIKE Toma, and I LIKE Mahane.\n\nNo, there are no Academy Awards here - but what we DO have is a good clean film with some positive things to say and a fun way to say them. For us, that was enough. And after several times of seeing The Legend of Johnny Lingo over the past few years, what seemed to be glaring flaws the first few times around have faded. I really like what's left.\n\n[Edit: We just watched this again after many years. And I thought, \"I really love this movie.\" So I went to read reviews, and was reading a review, and thought, \"Yeah, I agree.\" Then I noticed... I wrote the review! 15 years ago!\n\n15 years later and after a long absence, I feel the same. Even the obvious flaws in this movie are endearing. In fact, I upgraded my rating from an 8 to a 10.]",
