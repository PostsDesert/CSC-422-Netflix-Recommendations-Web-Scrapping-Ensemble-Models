This typically Japanese series takes place at a girls' school and chronicles three wacky adventures of the Exstars, 5 kick-butt(but SO polite!) members of the Etiquette Club who also have access to top-secret robosuits and fight the Etiquette Club's archrival, Sayaka Kitaoji, president of the Debutante Club, who wants to take over the world. Okay, it's been done to death. And maybe it's been done better. But the characters are so stereotypical I just have to grin, and admittedly, the mecha is pretty cool. For my first taste of real anime, I thought it was awfully awesome.",
