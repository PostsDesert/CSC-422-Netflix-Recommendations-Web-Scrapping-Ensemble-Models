I love indie flicks set in NYC like most Woody Allen flicks and films like Rodger Dodger, Tadpole, an indie flick with Adrien Brody which I can't recall the name but is an overlooked gem, etc. The ensemble cast is very good and the director connects the stories very well. I liked the stories with contractor and the hooker, Steve Buscemi was good as usual, and the scene with Michael Imperioli at the end with the hooker was very well acted. Also, the banter between Buscemi and the gorgeous Rosario Dawson was well written. I just wish they showed her naked as she looks like she got a nice body. Also, look for a pre Entourage Adrien Brenier who has a decent role. I thought he was very good in the overlooked indie \"The Adventures of Sebastian Cole\" also.",
