        "reviewBody": "I was born in 1986, and this show came on Nick when I was five. I was a little young during its original run to seriously enjoy it, but now that it's back on Noggin (who are also reviving the genius classic 'The Adventures of Pete and Pete') I think it's one of the most fantastically entertaining shows out there. It may not be the most ground breaking and original show I've ever seen in my life, but it really doesn't matter for the fact that you just can't get enough of it!\n\nClarissa Darling is a hip and smart high school girl who has the coolest outfits (not to mention the coolest room!) and often finds herself in complicated situations (such as dancing in a talent show and going on a blind date). She also has a little brother from hell named Ferguson (AKA Ferg-face or Ferg-wad), who always tries hard to become a businessman, stand-up comic... you name it.\n\nThe parents are just kind of average, but Sam's awesome because it's not too often you see a girl's best friend who's a guy (on a TV show that is).\n\n So all in all, give this show a shot if you get Noggin. It's a classic for all of us who were born in the '80s and grew up in the early '90s. : )"
