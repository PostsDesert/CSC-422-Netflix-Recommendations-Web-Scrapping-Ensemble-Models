It's only about 12 episodes, so if you do want to watch it, it's not an insanely long series, so you could probably finish it in a day or two. Vic Mignogna was absolutely HILARIOUS as Gawl, and his voice acting was on point in the more serious scenes. Loved the story line of the show, and I never saw the plot twist coming. I think this series is one of the most underrated anime series of all time, and I highly recommend it to any anime fan.",
