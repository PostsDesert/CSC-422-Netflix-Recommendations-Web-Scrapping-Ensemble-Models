The special effects are not quite up to Jurassic Park but they are the best yet in any documentary I've seen. My only criticism is that the movie is too short, just as it starts to pull you in, it's off to another timeline and new dinosaurs.\n\nOverall a great movie for youngsters, though it will leave serious dinosaur fans wanting more, much more.",
