        "reviewBody": "Bravo! A remake that tops the original! I loved this movie. Kudos to Charles Shyer, Jude Law, and screenwriter Elaine Pope for making this awesome movie! Sure, I wish Michael Caine could have played the role of Joe and Shirley Winters had played Alfie's neighbor, but other than that I totally dug the film.\n\nOh! And too bad the Rolling Stones didn't do the music. Sure, Mick Jagger and Dave Stewart did a great job, but if the Stones had done the music? Man! That woulda been ultra awesome! But yeah, this is a great story of a pretty boy Englishman ladies man and his trials and tribulations in modern day Manhattan! Great new setting for the remake! I think Alfie should have driven a motorcycle. A Rune. Other than his Vespa. I think the Vespa worked. But it wasn't ballsy enough I think. Still, it worked for the retro 60's vibe they were going for.\n\nThe rest of the cast is perfect. Nia Long and Omar Epps are perfectly cast. And Jude Law? Whoa, this is one of his best performances. And Alfie's words about F.B.B. -- face, boobs, bum! And how those things are what matter most to men. Too true.\n\nAnd Jane Krakowski was great in her role. The scene where she is in the limo. It had a kind of S&M feel to it with her hands in those straps. And man, her legs! Awesome! She is smokin' hot! You see just a bit of her naked bum in a shot where she walks off to meet her husband Phil the Pill after saying bye to Alfie. Hmmmmmmmm. Hot stuff.\n\nThis is more of a guy flick than a chick flick. Hell, a story about a guy getting women left and right? Now that's a dick flick! HA! I liked lots of little details about this film. Alfie's relationship with Julie and the scene where she makes him a late night dinner of chili and French bread. Yum! And Alfie selecting his wardrobe of Gucci and pink shirt at the start of the film. I could never wear that color but it works in this flick! And the ending. Man! Heartbreaking, tragic and magic! A guy who is doomed. But maybe there is some hope for him. Maybe. And! This is probably the old Charles Shyer directed film I've ever loved.\n\nOld habits die hard. As does the memory of this great movie."
