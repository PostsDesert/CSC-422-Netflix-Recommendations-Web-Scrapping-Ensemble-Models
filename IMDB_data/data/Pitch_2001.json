        "reviewBody": "I saw this directly before The Others in the Savoy in Dublin, & was pleasantly surprised. The short deals with a 'Waiting for Godot' type story, with James Joyce & Samuel Beckett waiting for WB Yeats to show up, so they can play pitch & putt. Joyce is a raving lunatic, while Beckett just looks at the golf ball, not uttering a single word 'til the very end, & even then in true Beckett fashion! Part of the 'Short Shorts' series, this is one of the better films to come out of Ireland in a long while (and that includes any feature stuff!).",
