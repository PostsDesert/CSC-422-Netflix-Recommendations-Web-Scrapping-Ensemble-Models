Though maybe it's just the preferences of my little 10 month old girl that she doesn't like it. Less than halfway through she starts whimpering and then crying. There's also a UFO between some of the segments that repeats a few times. Not sure if I want my baby to think there are really UFOs. As an adult, I find the video more interesting than the other Baby Einstein videos, but it is slower paced. The music is very subdued and quiet. The other videos seem to have upbeat music with a tempo. I won't resell the video yet, maybe she'll like in another year???",
