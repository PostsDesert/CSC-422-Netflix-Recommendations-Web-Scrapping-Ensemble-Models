        "reviewBody": "Eleven years ago (one year before this movie debuted), if you'd have told me you can get an entire movie from two guys sitting on their porch on a hot Friday afternoon, I'd have said you were nuts.\n\nI first saw this movie on a date with my girlfriend as a teenager way back in 1995 (it's hard to believe that was 10 years ago, I laughed through it then and I laugh through it now.\n\nIt's also the movie that made me a Chris Tucker mark.\n\nI see everything that guy is in.\n\nThe same goes for Cube.\n\nI love this movie's ability to show that ghettos aren't all like the 'Good Times' TV series.\n\nThis movie keeps it's lightheartedness throughout especially with funny characters to support Cube and Tucker like DJ Pooh, A.J. Johnson and Tiny Lister.\n\nIt also doesn't hurt to have Nia Long with her fine self in it either.\n\nBut as I stated this movie is very lighthearted and doesn't begin to get serious at all until the end where Craig tears Smokey a new one for getting him involved in the mess, Big Worm's assassination attempt on Craig and Smokey and Craig coming to the aid of Debbie (Nia) when D-bo (Lister) is beating her up.\n\nIt's at those two points you almost forget this is supposed to be a comedy movie.\n\nThe most important message in this movie actually came from Johnny Witherspoon who portrayed Craig's father.\n\nHe gave his son some very fatherly advise...which I hope to follow with my own son one day.\n\nAlthough I can't say I'd have been that calm if I walked into my son's room and saw him holding a semi-aotumatic 9mm pistol.\n\nBut I did like his advice....as I believe it was meant to be a message to the audience.\n\n\"You kids today are nothing but punks, so quick to pick up a gun. You scared to take an ass-whipping!\" (referring to his fists) \"These are all the protection you need. You win some, you lose some, but you live!\""
