It is slightly confusing to begin with because the hidden features are well hidden! IF you have difficulty in finding the \"Easter Eggs\" then there are some websites which tell you where they all are. Apart from this bit of confusion, it is a must for any Duranie! The DVD includes also loads of videos which you won't see on VH1 i.e. the long, uncut version of Girls on Film. It also has the New Moon on Monday movie version which in my opinion is brilliant. An excellent DVD!! Brilliant! Must-have if you love their Greatest Videos!",
