        "reviewBody": "Chori Chori is a nice movie which can be great to watch on a family evening.\n\nIt is about the two characters Khushi and Ranvir who do not fall for each other at first sight but after a certain time. Ranvir is an architect who has built a house for his childhood love Pooja. He asks her to marry him but she refuses. At a party he meets Khushi, a lively woman who is an orphan and lives alone in Delhi. When Khushi loses her job and the flat she moves into Ranvir's house in Shimla without his knowledge and claims to be his fianc√©e. After finding out about her Ranvir is quite angry but wants to continue the game just to make Pooja jealous so that she changes her mind. But Ranvir forgets one thing, that he could fall in love for Khushi.\n\nThe movie is quite the exact Bollywood copy of the Hollywood movie \"HouseSitter\" with Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn. Nevertheless I liked it, especially because of the great performance of Rani Mukherjee. She plays her role absolutely convincingly. For those who have not seen \"HouseSitter\", it's great to watch and for those who have seen it, maybe it won't be interesting but they will still like Rani's performance."
