Hey, why conduct a serious scientific expedition when you can romp around roasting the locals?\n\nAll its faults aside (and there are many of them), this is a fun movie to watch, particularly if you enjoy screaming in delight at all the bizarre events depicted on the screen.\n\nGo ahead and rent this one, just make sure no one sees you with the evidence."
