I love it and watch it all the time. My husband hates anime. He really got into it. He said this one isn't bad at all! I also love all the voices. Both Japanese and English.\n\nI love the characters and everything they go through. The lives of the characters, their relationship with each other, how they all come together and develop a fascinating story. Mirage of Blaze has left me with feelings of happiness. I even love some of the bad guys!! Mirage of Blaze is fast paced and very exciting from the get go. Each episode grabs you and doesn't let go. I want more......",
