        "reviewBody": "Lou Diamond Phillips and marina Black star together with Lee majors and Ernest Borgnine in an entertaining western drama. Lou plays an ex convict who tries to make a living as a mine worker, closely watched by Marshal Luther Toll. The convict knows he is just one step away from going back to prison if he gets out of line - but when he stops a neighbor from severely beating his wife and teams up with an old rancher who stands alone against the mine owner's interests things get complicated for our hero. The movie is not as tough as some of the recent western productions but it is atmospheric, entertaining, full of emotions and some nice action scenes. The actors do a great job and seem to enjoy themselves. For the missing shootout scenes and a rather tame showdown, I'll give it 8 out of 10 points, but I still enjoyed it and can recommend it.
