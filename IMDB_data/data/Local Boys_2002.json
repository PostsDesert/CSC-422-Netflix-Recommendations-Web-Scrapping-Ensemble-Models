I lowered my opinion a bit because of the cussing, but other than that, I loved it. My favorite part would have to be the part when Skeet first tries his new board. It was funny in a humiliating way. I liked how the actors new what they were doing. It's just neat to see a movie where that actor know how to act. Eric Christian Olsen, Mark Harmon, and Jeremy Sumpter portrayed the characters wonderfully. It was great to see how Jessica and Jim kind of liked each other, and then Jim suddenly disappeared. I was, however, surprised to see how Randy reacted to Jim."
