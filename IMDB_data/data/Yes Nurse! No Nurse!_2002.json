        "reviewBody": "Happy comment on the 60-ties in the pre-hippie era, where everything had to be neat and tidy. The story is about a household ruled by a good and naive nurse that has to compete with a nasty neighbour. The film was made after the television series, that turned some characters' behaviour more into a running gag than a film is able to do. The original TV-series only remain to exist in the memory of people as the tape copies were reused and thus destroyed in the pre-VCR times. Based on the concepts of the series a new script was made with a simple storyline that makes up a nice base for singing (of the original songs) and dancing. Most of the songs are now classics by writer Annie M.G. Schmidt and composer Harrie Bannink, who both recently died. I think nevertheless that it is a very Dutch movie. Subtilties are harder to understand for outsiders. One other goof found. In the scene with the singing flight attendants, a model plane is used of a 747-400. It was introduced in 1988. Even a 747 is questionable as it wasn't launched until 1969 and KLM took it's first one into operation in 1971.",
