        "reviewBody": "This made for TV movie is perhaps one of the best factual accounts that I have watched in a while.\n\nThe story of a single mother brilliantly played by the beautiful Estella Warren is one of those film that won't let you look away for a second. You cant keep you eyes off the screen. Yes I did find it that good.\n\nThe plot consists of a single mother ( Warren) who after a quarrel that turns physical with her boyfriend, goes to the local emergency room for treatment. The doctor on duty.played quite well by John Hannah sedates her (Warren) and rapes her. she goes to the police who initially doubt her story . Doctor Darian (Hannah) is something of a local \"darling\" and almost the entire town sides with him and against the victim. (Warren). The Doctor uses his good relations with the local authorities to defame his victim, and uses extreme measures to elude prosecution.\n\nForced to relocate she then embarks on a crusade to prove that she was in fact raped by the Doctor. Needless to say the Doctor continues with rather creative ways to pass DNA tests. Not getting justice from the authorities she goes and hires a private investigator to get her due justice.\n\nI will not divulge further details since many readers have not seen this film.\n\nThe courage and perseverance of this woman, in seeking justice is truly inspirational.\n\nThis is a true story that to the dis-credit of many societies happens quite often. Something we all need to fight for change. .",
