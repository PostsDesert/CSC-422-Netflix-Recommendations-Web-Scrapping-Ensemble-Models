        "reviewBody": "The first thing you will notice about VISIBLE SECRET is its strange sensibilities. Even the film's rhythm is slightly \"off\", making it very different from the current rash of Hong Kong \"I See Ghost\" movies of late. Although the premise is overly familiar by now (Shu Qi plays a woman who can see ghosts -- but only with her left eye!), the movie works as an effective human drama (especially the lead's relationship with his brother and father) and as a quirky comedy (the movie is oftentimes very funny). As a ghost story, it falters badly, and there's a twist at the end that, if you weren't asleep during the previous 90 minutes, you can see coming about 50 miles away.\n\nOne other thing: VISIBLE SECRET has almost no scares in it. There are some attempts at mood and atmosphere, but for the most part the laughs and over-the-top hilarity overcomes the thrills and chills, which comes across as more mundane requisite than anything the filmmakers were interested in putting into their movie.\n\n7 out of 10\n\n(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of the film, and reviews of other movies in this genre)",
