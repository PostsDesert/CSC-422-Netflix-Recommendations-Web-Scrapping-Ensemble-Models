        "reviewBody": "As much as I would like to, I cannot recommend Judaai to my friends unless they did not mind fast forwarding whenever Johnny Lever shows up. The story line to Judaai is fascinating, production values are top notch, songs are good, and, as always, Sridevi, Anil, and Urmila are at the top of their form. All other serious supporting roles are good. Then there is the comedy if that is what you want to call it. It frequently brought the plot to a screeching halt and, after the first hour of the film, I almost gave up but decided on fast forwarding the rest of the comedy sections which I should have done earlier. I enjoyed the comedy in Dil Chahta Hai and Awara Paagal Deewana and even like the Johnny Lever characters in Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya and Sirf Tum, but cringed every time Johnny Lever et. al showed up in this film. I gave the film a 6 only because the comedy sequences were so irritating and lengthy. Had the film just focused on the drama and inserted comedy about Sridevi's new found wealth, I would have given it a 9.",
