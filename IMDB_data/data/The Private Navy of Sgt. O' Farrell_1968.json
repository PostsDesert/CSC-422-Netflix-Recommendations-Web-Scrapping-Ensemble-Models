O'Farrell dreams aloud of being in a bathtub with a geisha girl \"steering his ship.\" Somebody certainly steered this Hope-hackery over the cliff, as it features Phyllis Diller and Gina Lollobrigida and still can't work up any laughs or excitement. Frank Tashlin is to blame for the lax direction (he also had a hand in the screenplay, though I have no idea why he wanted the credit). Alan Stensvold's cinematography is an eyesore, and Hope has never seemed so square and bland. Where's Bing Crosby when you need him? NO STARS from ****",
