        "reviewBody": "This is a typical direct to video horror movie, with the exception of Samantha Aisling, the acting is pretty bad (especially Ken Shamrock). I thought Samantha Aisling was very attractive and a pretty good actor, especially considering that according to IMDb this is her only film. Hopefully we'll be seeing a lot more of her in the near future. This isn't a horrible movie, but I don't think anyone renting this should be expecting award winning movie making. If you go realizing it is a low budget horror movie it's pretty good. I thought the special effects were pretty good, the scarecrow looks fairly scary as long as they don't show close-ups of it. When they show close-ups it looks like what it is... I guy in a Halloween mask. One of the things I did like about it was that, in most every horror movie, the monster waits until each person is alone then kills them one by one. The scarecrow actually attacks them as a group, nothing really special, just something different. I liked it, it's good for a minor scares and a couple of laughs. I gave it a 5/10",
