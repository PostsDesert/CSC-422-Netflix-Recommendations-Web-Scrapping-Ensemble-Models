Fine for what it is but it's sad that SciFi passed this off as a real documentary instead of a commercial for the Village/Shyamalan (but I guess that is on par for a channel that passes off that fraud John Edwards as anything more than a bad circus act.)\n\nThink 'This is Spinal Tap' without any of the wit, humor or even decent acting.\n\n(3/10)",
