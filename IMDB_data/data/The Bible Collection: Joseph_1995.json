It showed God's love and plan for our lives and His people even though we don't see it.\n\nThe book of Esther had two major themes in it for me, one was how a wife is to prepare for her husband, Esther prepared for the King 12 months, second Esther's obedience that ultimately led to the Jewish people being spared from slaughter. Please notice that the queen could only be summoned by the King, Esther and the Jewish people prayed and fasted for three days in order to soften the King's heart when Esther approached him unannounced.\n\nThe movie also showed the sweet relationship between Esther and the King.\n\nI highly recommend this movie!
