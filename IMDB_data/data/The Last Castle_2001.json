In this case, a prisoner manages to give the other inmates some honor by reminding them that they were soldiers. The tension escalates and explodes when one of the prisoners dies. A revolt breaks out in which the prisoners can control the prison but everything ends when the flag is raised.\n\nA clear propaganda movie that works beautifully. I r eally liked this film for the martial sense and honor it inspires despite being set in a prison and there are characters who manage to capture you in the story and played really well.",
