        "reviewBody": "Dr. John Richards (Hannes Jaenicke) is working on a top secret transmitting ray, called the \"Triton,\" which can move objects from one place to another instantly by scrambling its molecules. However, John's Assistant Angie (Ariauna Albright) devises a different use for the machine, which enables her to turn into an exact replica of John. With John locked away in a secret warehouse, Angie, who now looks like John, and her evil accomplice, Martin Grecko (Steve Scionti), proceed with their evil plan to set John up to make it look like he's trying to steal the machine and then make $4 million from it in the meantime. Dr. Richards' son, Jackie (Harrison Myers) and his wife, Barbara (Mary Elizabeth McGlynn billed as \"Melissa Williamson\") step forward to thwart the evil duo. It becomes much easier after Jackie accidentally renders his mom invisible. This movie sat on the shelf for three years and it's easy to see why. The cheap special effects reflects the film's near microscopic budget. The script is filled with dull clich√©s and a silly, overly simplistic plot. Only children under the age of ten are likely to find this movie even remotely amusing."
