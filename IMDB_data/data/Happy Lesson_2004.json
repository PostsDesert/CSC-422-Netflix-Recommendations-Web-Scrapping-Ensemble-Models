This series is way too bland for my tastes. I guess their's a demand for it, there must be as this and \"Sister Princess\" and \"Love Hina, and \"Tenchi Muyo, and blah blah blah, etc. are all the same. This one isn't as good as most in the sub-genre. And I don't really recommend it much at all. I didn't really know much about it before watching and neither of the directors have any prior credits so I have no one to blame but myself.\n\nMy Grade:D+ \n\nWhere I saw it: Anime Network on Demand"
