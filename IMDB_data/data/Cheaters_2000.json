        "reviewBody": "This is perhaps the best reality show on TV. This is true drama. Human beings at their worst. Men and Women behaving like children and most of them not even caring. Shows you that you can sometimes never really trust the person who's supposed to have your back. Love it. The music, the voice-over artist, the commitment to form - every show has the \"deceptive lover/husband/wife\" lying on the phone. I don't understand why there are so many negative reactions to this show. I'm sick of seeing the same cookie-cutter cute people running around having fun and being stupid because they can't communicate their feeling or intentions. With Cheaters - we have all sorts of people who are in that place that we all fear to be in: Infidelity. Where a person who has given into that mental illness called love which requires you to open yourself up to being hurt by another person - and gets hurt by that person. It sucks that with the FCC crap they have blurred out the cheating couples even more. You don't have any idea what \"position\" they're in. Once again, great show."
