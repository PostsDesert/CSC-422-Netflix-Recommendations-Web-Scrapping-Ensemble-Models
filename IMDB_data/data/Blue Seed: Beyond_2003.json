        "reviewBody": "Let me start off by saying I love Blue Seed. On many occasions, I have watched the entire show in one sitting. So when I found out ADV was going to release Blue Seed Beyond, I was pretty dang excited. But all that changed when I rented this. First of all, the animation quality is TERRIBLE. It resembles the TV show in no way. It was animated the new way with a computer, but it actually looks worse than the TV series. Secondly, the story is lousy. Two episodes is way too short to revive an enemy that they fought for 26 episodes, and moving it to America made it even worse because part of the charm of the original was it was a Japanese legend. All the are characters back, but they do not act the same and they are almost aren't even used in the story. The villain is laughably bad, and if you watch the dubbed version, you won't even find it funny but unbearable. And to add insult to injury, they throw in a third episode that has nothing to do with the series. It involves a terrorist planting a bomb in a hot spring where the characters are, and if the level of the water changes, it goes off. It seemed like a rip off of Burn Up, and had nothing to do with Blue Seed. It wasn't funny, it wasn't dramatic, and even the fan service (which they obviously wrote the episode for) wasn't good or interesting. Even though I pride myself on not being a troll or arguing with trolls, I honestly cannot say enough bad things about this OAV. Just rewatch all your old blue seed tapes and do not even think about this, for it might as well not exist."
