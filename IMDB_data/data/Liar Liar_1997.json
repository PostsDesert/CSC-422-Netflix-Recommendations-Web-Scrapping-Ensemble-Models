His son wishes Carrey can only tell the truth for 24 hours, and it comes true. Unfortunately for Jim, it comes just as he is about to embark on the court case of a lifetime. Watching him go through the motions was a treat, and i guarantee you will love it. You will have to see it to understand, because most of it is too difficult to describe with written words, but it was FUNNY!\n\n*** 1/2 out of ****"
