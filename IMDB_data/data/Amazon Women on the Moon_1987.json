        "reviewBody": "There's no subtlety with \"Amazon Women on the Moon\"; a lot of the gags are on-the-nose and sometimes I actually wanted to shake my head for laughing. But I think the key here is the execution. \n\nFor starters, just look at the cast on this thing. It's one name actor after another, and I don't think there's a weakness among them. Also, the subject matter (late-night TV) seems ripe for parody; it lends itself to the movie's shameless mix of ribald and farcical. But more important than all of this is the ability to surprise. My favorite segment (aside from Arsenio Hall's being systematically attacked by his own apartment) is Don \"No Soul\" Simmons:\n\n\"Did you know that every seven minutes, a black person is born in this country without soul?\"\n\nIt wouldn't be a stretch to say that David Alan Grier walks away with this movie. \n\nThere's just something about this that works; it's consistently funny, the bits are largely memorable, and it's got John Landis' fingerprints all over it. Sold! \n\n8/10",
