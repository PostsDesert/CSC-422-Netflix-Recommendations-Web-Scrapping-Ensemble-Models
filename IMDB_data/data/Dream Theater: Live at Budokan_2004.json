If you want to seek finesse and grace of music craftsmanship, get this video. If you want to see a real concert and not just a crappy show, get this video. If you want to improve your music skills, get this video. Simply said, this IS one of the bands you must listen to before you die... If possible, collect all their DVD releases and their albums. I've listened to them for the last 8 years and so far none can match their heart and skills they put in their songs. Perfection at its best can only be described (and maybe subscribed to) this band.",
