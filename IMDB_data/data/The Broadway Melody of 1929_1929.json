        "reviewBody": "I agree with Kieran Kenney, Historians who give bad reviews on this film must be smoking something or don't know what talent is, Historians seem to call movies good that aren't. Some of these so-called Hollywood and Movie Historians are blind. I love this movie. This is my favorite musical and movie. The Broadway Melody was the film that opened the door for musicals and was one of the first Talkies. Everyone holds their own in this own. Anita Page is so talented. I can't see why she didn't become one of MGM'S biggest star. Anita Page was more beautiful then most of the other stars of early Hollywood. Anita Page was one of the most beautiful women in the history of Hollywood. She's still alive, people should be trying to interview, write a book on her, and get the public to know her. She's one of the few living of early Hollywood. Historians and classic movie fans should appreciate her, give her recognition, instead of writing 5 sometimes 10 books on the same classic star. How many books does it take to tell a person's life? Anita Page has plenty of stories about herself and other stars. In every movie Anita was in she gave her heart and soul. Anita always gave a performance. I enjoyed every movie I've seen her in. \n\nI love Bessie Love in this movie also, MGM gave her worthless movies after The Broadway Melody. Bessie Love was a talented actress and dancer. it wasn't her, so it must of been the studio's fault of her not making the transition to being a Talkie Star. Another one who didn't make it was Mary Doran who played Flo and the girl Hank(Bessie Love) gets in a fight with. Mary Doran was talented, but she usually had bit parts but she always stole the scene. In this movie everyone gives a performance of a lifetime, they give Academy Award performances, they give put their heart and soul in this movie. I don't know but this movie gives you the feel of how life was back in the late 1920s, early 1930s. Times weren't as innocent as people think. People back then seem to be full of life, full of love, full of song and dance(unlike today). This movies puts you in that era. If you got a taste for good movies, you'll love this. Hollywood don't make movies like this anymore."
