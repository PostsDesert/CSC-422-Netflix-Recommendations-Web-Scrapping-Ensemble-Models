And he was excellent in The Silence of the Lambs. This is a good story about two women who quickly became friends. Shared stories and secrets about men (read Helen's review for more info).\n\nI was glad I watched it. Hadn't seen Stockard Channing much lately. She was in The First Wive's Club just for a bit. I should have seen the ending coming where Edie's new boyfriend is Pen's old... oh nevermind, go watch it.\n\n7.5 out of 10",
