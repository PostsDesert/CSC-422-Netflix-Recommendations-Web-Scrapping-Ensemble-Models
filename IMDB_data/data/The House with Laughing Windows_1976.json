        "reviewBody": "The restorer Stefano (Lino Capolicchio) is hired by the Mayor Solmi (Bob Tonelli) of a small village nearby Ferrara to restore a painting of St. Sebastian, made by the mentally disturbed painter Buono Legnani in the local church. Stefano was recommended by his friend, Dr. Antonio Mazza (Giulio Pizzirani), and he learns that Legnani was known as \"The Painter of the Agony\", since he used to paint near-death people. Further, he was presumed dead many years ago but his body has never been found.\n\nStefano works in the church, where he meets the weirdo Lidio (Pietro Brambilla), and he has one night stand with the local nymphomaniac teacher (Vanna Busoni) that is leaving the village. Meanwhile Antonio investigates the life of Buono Legnani and tells Stefano that he had found a dark secret about the painter and the villagers. However, Antonio dies before meeting Stefano and the police conclude that he committed suicide.\n\nStefano is intrigued by the mystery surrounds Legnani and decides to investigate more about the deranged painter. However, he in evicted of his hotel room and Lidio brings him to the isolated house of a paraplegic woman (Pina Borione) where he lives. Meanwhile, he meets the teacher's substitute Francesca (Francesca Marciano) and they have a love affair. Francesca moves to Stefano's room and they are affected by the strange atmosphere of the place.\n\nWhen the restoration is damaged by acid, Stefano decides to leave the village with Francesca. However, he meets the alcoholic driver Coppola (Gianni Cavina) that decides to disclose to him the secret of the house of the laughing windows. But now it seems to be too late to move out of the mysterious village.\n\n\"La Casa Dalle Finestre Che Ridono\" is a dark film developed in a creepy nightmarish atmosphere and visibly inspired in \"The Wicker Man\". The lead character seems to be trapped in his morbid curiosity of discovering the hidden secret of the village and never leaves the spot. Like many Europeans movies, the plot has many open questions, maybe with the intention of discussing them among friends or in forums and board like the one in IMDb. After watching the film, it is worthwhile reading the interpretations of other Users to improve yours or find some missing detail. Last but not the least, the beauty of Francesca Marciano is really impressive. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"A Casa com Janelas Sorridentes\" (\"The House with Laughing Windows\")",
