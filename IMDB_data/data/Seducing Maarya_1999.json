So many Canadian movies I have watched offer poor lighting, sound and dark or weird plots with often even weirder endings. Maybe it it because the movie industry here does not have the money for their productions. I think the acting was mostly good but the crafting of the movie in my opinion was very poor and the bad sound became annoying. The story was interesting and intriguing but I just do not feel that overall it was executed as well as it could have been. So much of the background of Maarya was hazy even in the end. However, having said that I did hang in there and watch it until the end so there must have been enough to hold my interest.",
