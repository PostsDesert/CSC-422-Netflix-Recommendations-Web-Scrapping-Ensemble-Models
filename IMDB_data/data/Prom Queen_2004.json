        "reviewBody": "This uplifting comedy-drama is based on the true story of Marc Hall, the Canadian gay teen who sued the Catholic Church for not letting him bring his boyfriend to his High School Prom. Like a homo-positive \"Afterschool Special,\" Prom Queen has a terrific cast which includes openly gay \"Kids In The Hall\" comedian Scott Thompson and rising star Aaron Ashmore as the blue-eyed, blue-haired rebel who boldly confronts the homophobic school board, and ultimately takes on the Catholic Church. This heartfelt story inspires and entertains as it offers up a heroic portrait of gay teen activism and portrays the true courage of his straight friends and family as they rally together to send Marc and his boyfriend to the prom.",
