I can say it was a very pleasant surprise. May be the story is not very good but there is so much more that is great that it didn't bother me. The story isn't bad either, it is pretty standard. It is about revenge, of course with some hidden secrets, and great samurais like Kenshin himself.\n\nThe animation is perfect for a movie like this. The fighting sequences look great and powerful, almost like you're in the middle of the fight yourself. The opening sequence amazed me in every positive way possible. Only the way this movie looks makes it interesting and entertaining to watch. Like I said, I wasn't sure if I was going to like this movie, but I did. Even more than that.",
