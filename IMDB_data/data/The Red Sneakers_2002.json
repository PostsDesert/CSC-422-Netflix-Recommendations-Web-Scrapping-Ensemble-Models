        "reviewBody": "The movie is a typical play sports vs. have a fulfilling life type theme and is somewhat predictable coming down to the last minute of a championship game. However, it is well worth watching as a feel-good family type movie. There are some surprises along with the expected moral to the story. Being from a family full of coaches and basketball players and having a fascination with math definitely made this movie more entertaining for me, but I think it would also be enjoyed by those who are not particularly sports fans. It is one I will recommend to family and friends. Fans of Vincent D'Onofrio will enjoy watching him briefly in a character different than what they are used to. I'm sorry I left this one sitting on the shelf for so long.",
