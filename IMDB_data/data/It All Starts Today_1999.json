Apparently there are not sufficient financial means for the schools and the teachers are confronted with the enormous task of holding everything together. The schoolmaster Daniël Lefebre (Philippe Torreton) manages to be as well a celebration-organizer, a social worker, a psycho-therapeutist, a pediatrist and ... a good teacher. Does he have a private life? He must be an idealist. As long as such people continue to work for the good of the upcoming youth, our civilization has less chances to fall apart. This movie is an encouragement for all good teachers in the world.",
