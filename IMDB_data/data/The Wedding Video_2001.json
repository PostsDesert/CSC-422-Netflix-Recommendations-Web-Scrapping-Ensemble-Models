        "reviewBody": "Why this movie gets such angry reviews is a mystery to me. It's no way an innovative story and has no daring Hangover jokes but it's absolutely entertaining. The comic moments are delivered well but it stays a little on the timid side. It could have had more of an edge and there is a tendency to have rather great moments end in a bit of an anti climax. Lucy Punch is great as the former wild girl getting married. She has a unique quirky style that you either love or not at all; that was obviously the risk to leave the leading role to her. If this movie doesn't suit you this might be why but there is nothing wrong with either the acting performance or the script.",
