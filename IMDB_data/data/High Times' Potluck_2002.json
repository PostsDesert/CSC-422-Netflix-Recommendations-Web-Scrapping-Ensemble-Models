        "reviewBody": "A female Scorsese is born. New York Streets, gritty, street actors, experimental, witty, great direction, in your face camera work. Times square chase scene with wild animal sound affects underneath are very cool. Lots of very subtle things you could miss. Mobsters, punk rockers, transvestites, upper east side yuppies, cops, politicians, rappers, bankers, potheads. It reminded me of a cross between the movie \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" and \"Mean Streets\" on Pot. I rented this from the video store and watched it twice as i found extra stuff I missed the first time. I am a big fan of Jason Issacs work he is a cool actor!! I loved him in \"The Patriot\" with Mel Gibson, in every film he plays someone different you can hardly recognize him. He's also in Armageddon and the Harry Potter films. I'd watch Potluck again! I wonder what Ms. S will do next!",
