        "reviewBody": "I just saw this movie at the 34:th Gothenburg International Film Festival, Sweden. My strategy for picking movies this festival was more or less random - and that's how and why I like going on a festival, being it film or music. So I really had no idea of what to expect from Daniel Cockburn and his movie.\n\nIt started with sea waves rolling calmly over the screen, soon accompanied by a voice asking us to just look at the waves and think. Just think. It is all very \"new age\". After a while the speaker is replaced with a narrator and out of focus people walking hastily on a sidewalk. This crowd is named \"Alan\" and from this point it all gets strange. And very fascinating. Daniel Cockburn (also script) takes us to all kinds of different places and the people occupying them. Mostly we are guided by voice over, bur sometimes there is dialogue.\n\nI really loved this movie. I just sat back in my chair and enjoyed the images, the narration, and all the nice characters. What does he want to conduct to / tell us, the audience? Confusion? Headache? Happiness? Well, I'm not sure, but I really enjoyed the ride!",
