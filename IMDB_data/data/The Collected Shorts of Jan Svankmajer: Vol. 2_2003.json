        "reviewBody": "The short films of Jan Svankmajer are very unusual to say the least. Using what are often everyday objects and rubbish, he is able to create some amazingly bizarre stop-motion films. Each is very creative but some are so creepy that I am not sure they are for everyone's taste. However, I love the films and recommend you see them as soon as possible.\n\nIn this second disc from \"The Collected Shorts of Jan Svankmajer\", you see his later films--that is, later but not including his more recent ones. As far as I could tell, there is no collection featuring his more recent films. Compared to disc one, this collection is more interesting--and more weird. In fact, every one of them is well worth seeing--even the couple that are under a minute long. Exceptionally well animated and never dull--this collection is a must-see for anyone who likes international animations.",
