It's lighthearted, full of one-liners, and surprisingly tame on the \"let's show some breasts\" element. I appreciate the fact that nudity was not a chief concern for this story. I never thought these gals were dumb at all, the references to them as bimbos came from the \"dudes\" who were just not very bright themselves. And like Thelma and Louise, they rise above all the obstacles in their way. Think of this film as celebration of spiritedness and going for your dreams, well, even if it's a cowabunga barbecue! Favorite line: \"MMMMM I love pancakes!\"",
