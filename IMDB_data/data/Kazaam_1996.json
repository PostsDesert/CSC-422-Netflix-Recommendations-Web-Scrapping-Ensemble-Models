I'm still trying to get back the couple hours I wasted on it.\n\nLet me leave it simply with - Shaq has NO BUSINESS being an actor or singer. He is utterly without talent at both discplines. It's a crying shame that substantially more talented people waste away in community theatres and karaoke bars while Shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservedly get cast in movies and cut CDs.\n\nMuch of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no-talent that is Shaq.",
