This aint Western Sizzlin, ya know!\n\nSo it was mindless, laughable, and possessed all of the other attributes that all TCM movies have. So what.\n\nCan we really say that the original TCM had any kind of cinematic value. It was intense, graphic...yes. But the dialogue, (the small amount that it required) was no more cerebral than any TCM produced after.\n\nI agree with the viewer in Baltimore that the mechanical leg was very funny. I preferred the trailer park babe who was constantly making references to her fake breasts. She was funny. The movie did go downhill with the arrival of the freak in the limo. It became very disjointed. So did all of the others, though. All TCM movies have always been about one subject...mindless violence and shock value.\n\nIf you didn't like it...fine. I was disappointed that the two main characters are embarrassed about making the movie. It's not something to be proud of, no. But it is still a piece of film that they got paid for. Also a break that they were given, as unknown actors. Just goes to show that once actors make it to the top, they forget the mere humans at the bottom, that boosted them up."
