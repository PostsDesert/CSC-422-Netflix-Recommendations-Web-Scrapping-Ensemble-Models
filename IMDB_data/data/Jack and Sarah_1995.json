        "reviewBody": "This movie start getting promos about the same time as French Kiss but was held back for release in my area of the world presumably because of the Ryan/Klein comedy which local powers felt would steal its audience. Some half year later I was invited to a preview showing. Most of the audience were little old ladies from 30 on upwards - not that the audience was consistently old, but it definitely had that kind of feeling. The experience was also unique in that the movie got a standing ovation at the end. It's just a comedy, but it's more than that too: It's a very heart-warming comedy, and to my way of thinking is all that the British 'Jurassic Park' (Four Weddings and a Funeral) was supposed to be - very British, but a lot better view. Critics say it's Grant which provides the surprise element, as he never reveals what is coming next, but there are a lot of cute plot twists here as well - not in the least the final closing titles scene."
