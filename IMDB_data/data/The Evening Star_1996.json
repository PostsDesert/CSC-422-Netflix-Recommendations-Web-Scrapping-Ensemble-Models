Let me just say that I cried for a lot longer in this movie. For a sequel, it's excellent. It's almost like a story in a story.\n\n In Aurora's later years, when her grandchildren are grown up and she even has a great-grand son (who enjoys singing \"For she's a jolly good butt whole which nobody can deny\" to Aurora's great annoyance) Aurora is still looking for the love of her life. She's still chasing after men, and finds one at, that, with her counselor/physchiatrist played by Bill Paxton. The romantic scenes between these two are unmissable. But here's where the problems strike the movie. In the first movie, Aurora was a little bit more....well.... unpremiscuous as you could possibly get. Here, she's a little more floozy-ish. Aurora changes from \"Terms of Endearment\" to this movie. This is still an excellent movie, with an extrememly heart-felt, and sad ending. I loved it! For those who liked \"Terms\", you'll love \"The Evening Star.\" Shirley MacLaine shines. :)"
