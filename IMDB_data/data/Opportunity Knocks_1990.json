        "reviewBody": "I'm the first to be skeptical of any movie like this. In fact, most movies I watch these days involves at least one visit to IMDb.COM first. But some movies, no matter how accurately they may be reviewed for technical merits just can't review the sentimental or personal value they may have to you. This is one of them. Oh, trust me - I've watched my share of movies like this that have left me more than high and dry - but this one is different (at least for me). I've always felt Dana Carvey was a special comedian and has never reached his full potential as an actor. However poor the writing, or perhaps his acting, the movie is engaging enough to keep this harden skeptic enthralled for greater than 90mins. That's saying a lot.\n\nThis movie will surely not go down in history as a one of the 'greats' of comedy - but is well worth an evening if you're just looking for something funny, heart-touching and romantic."
