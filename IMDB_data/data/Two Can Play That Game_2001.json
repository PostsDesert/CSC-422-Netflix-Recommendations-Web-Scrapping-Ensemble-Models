        "reviewBody": "A smart and sassy ad exec, Shante ( Viveca Fox looking very hot ) wants to keep her man, Keith ( Morris Chestnut also looking pretty fine ) in check after he messes up by saying he is \"working late\" and ends up taking another woman to \"their\" restaurant for some drinks and dancing. What happens next is Shante's 10 day rules of putting you man in check. We're taken along for hilarious ride as Shante and Keith match wits to see who can get the upper hand. The movie depicts very honestly, and in a humorous way, the games men and women play with each other. Anthony Anderson is a riot as Keith's friend, Tony, who helps Keith battle the very sly Shante at her game. Shante's gal pals, Wendy Raquel Robinson, Mo'Nique, and Tamala Jones, are also pretty funny. Gabrielle Union makes a sexy turn as Shante's nemesis who is after Keith and isn't shy about it. This battle of the sexes romp is hilarious and witty and should just be enjoyed for what it is; a real good time. A great friends get together flick.",
