        "reviewBody": "At first glance, one could be forgiven for thinking The West Wing Documentary is yet another self-congratulatory network fusion of EPK's and B-roll designed to create 'event' television for the promotional convenience it affords the broadcast of re-packaged re-runs. But such thinking is wrong. The West Wing Documentary illuminates the fundamental appeal of the series: the hour-long weekly fantasy of a world of noble politics where intelligence triumphs and where the ego  whilst playfully present  is tamed in the interest of service, compassion, justice and unity.\n\nAs with many dreams, one wonders just how fantastical the visions we beheld for its duration really were. This documentary shines some light on whence our hopes  that we eagerly sustain through our consumption of the West Wing - come and provides some forgiveness for our delusions; we are reminded by famous politicians and daunted, ambitious and idealistic staffers alike that these hopes and dreams exist at least in the rhetoric and charm of the so-called real political world.\n\nA must-watch for any West Wing fan. If only it were included with the DVD boxed set!!!!"
