        "reviewBody": "Nice action piece, with some nice period detail of what it was probably like being a US bomber pilot in the US in the war. While not the movie mainly focuses on the the relationship between the three main characters, it also focuses on Buzz's character, a vaguely psychotic bomber pilot.\n\nMotivations and the lives on the bomber crew are shown, I quite liked the setting and the portrayal of these guys. The relationship between Buss, Boland and Daphne is a tad clichéd...and really seems to be one of those war movies that are spoiled because it was felt there was a need to fit a romance into it.\n\nLots of great footage of bombers, including some amazing footage of a bomber landing on its belly with no undercarriage, and some low level stunt stuff that has to be played with a good sound system. However some of the effects are a tad dodgy, and all the Luftwaffe fighter footage is obvious grainy stock footage..shame that they went to the trouble to use real US bombers, but couldn't get hold of a few Messercshmidts!",
