Seeing the special really made me wish that I could have seen \"Phantom of the Opera\" on Broadway with him as the Phantom. His selections from that musical sounded heavenly. His other selections, especially the Irish music, were also beautiful. I only wish my local video store had this in stock so I could rent it sometime.",
