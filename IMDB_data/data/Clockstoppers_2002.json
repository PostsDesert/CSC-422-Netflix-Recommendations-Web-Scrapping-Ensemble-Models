I mean, it's about everyone's fantasy, to be able to stop time and do what you are doing while everyone else is frozen. Except in this movie the people really aren't frozen, it is just that the people with the stop watches are able to speed themselves up so it looks like everyone else is standing still. A pretty cool idea, but when the bad guys show up with the special watches, a bunch of plot holes show up. And it was amusing, especially the dance party scene when Zak and Francesa spin their DJ friend around, so in real time it looks like he is a really good dancer.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: A fairly entertaining kids movie. I think 9-13 year olds will like it, plus it isn't a total bore for adults."
