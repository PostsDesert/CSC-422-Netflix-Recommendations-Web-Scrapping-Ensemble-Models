        "reviewBody": "A rather comprehensive exposition on the history of genetics, from Mendel to CRISPR. Real-world consequences on our breakthroughs - or lack thereof - in genetics are utilized to break up the linearity of the narrative. The pacing is tight, but never hurried. Some events are inherently dramatic, but they're never overly sensationalized. All concepts and terminologies are at least briefly explained.\n\nThere are no groundbreaking filmmaking techniques or artistry here, but that's not the point, it's meant more as an informative public lecture on genetics.",
