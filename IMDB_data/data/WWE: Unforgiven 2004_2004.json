He even was a victim of Rikishi's stinky face. There's gotta be a reason why he was inducted, especially before veterans such as Hulk Hogan, Bret Hart, and Roddy Piper, I know they had past beef with McMahon, but they're more deserving than a former baseball player whose memories in wrestling are being embarrassed by Kane. So, this year they inducted William Perry, former NFL star in the Hall Of Fame. He only made one appearance at Wrestlemania 2 and eliminated Big John Studd. I suppose next year they'll induct Mr. T and Lawrence Taylor. I just hope that more ring veterans will be inducted before other sport stars do."
