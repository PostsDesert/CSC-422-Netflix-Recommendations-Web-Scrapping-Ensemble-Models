The scenery, the sounds, the lighting, just like a day by the beach. I was totally mesmerized by the cinematography.\n\nI am not professional reviewer and I don't write often about photography etc but this was one time that it needed mentioned.\n\nI do know what I like and I really liked this movie. I recommend it to anyone and everyone. It touched my heart and I will be forever grateful for that touch.",
