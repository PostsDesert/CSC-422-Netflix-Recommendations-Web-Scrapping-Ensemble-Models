I thought this was going to be another lame, stupid movie that looked like it was filmed in my backyard but it wasn't. It was totally scary. This movie kept me thinking and thinking way after the credits were done rolling. I have rented it twice and still love it. The acting is awesome, the plot rocks, the twists are cool, and the filing (thank god!) is good! If you ever have the chance, you have to see this movie! I promise that you will get a scary, suspenseful movie! There is one nasty scene which should have never been put into this movie in the first place because it has nothing to do with the plot, but ignore it and keep on watching!\n\nMy Take out of 5 *'s\n\n*****"
