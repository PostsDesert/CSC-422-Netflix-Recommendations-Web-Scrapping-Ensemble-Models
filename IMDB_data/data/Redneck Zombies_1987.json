It's got tons of gore, hilarious dialogue, some surprisingly good acting, and some truly disturbing moments. I didn't expect to actually be unnerved by a film with a title like Redneck Zombies, but it definitely has some moody, disconcerting scenes in it. Released by Troma, the undisputed kings of bad taste cinema. Go pick up a copy today, or I'll go a lookin' fer ya. HEH, HEH, HEH!!!"
