By \"Classic\" we are talking here the ilk of Blue Angel and Casablanca. This film portrays the existential tale of human loneliness embodied by the forlorn hapless Mona, incapable of love and unwilling to thank people for their efforts to help her....And those who help her- how skillfully they are handled by the movie maker. \n\nWhether to hold their nose, love her or kick her, they know not.Last week I saw \"North Country\", loved it and gave it 3 stars, but this epic of the strange wandering girl deserves 5. It is the best movie I have seen this year. The five stars apply also to the music, photography and characterizations.",
