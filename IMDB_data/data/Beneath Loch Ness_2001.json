It's sad to see even slightly recognisable personnel in such an abysmal production. I can only assume that they fired the person responsible for continuity, as there are more holes in this picture than a dartboard.\n\nIts set in a Scotland where:-\n\nPeople speak in American, Irish, English, and probably Punjabi accents- but not Scottish.\n\nThe loch Ness monster looks like something from a game on the commodore 64\n\nPeople drive American 4x4 vehicles on the wrong side of the road\n\nThe police wear American uniforms\n\nYou can use American dollars in the local shops and pubs\n\netc., etc. - the list goes on.\n\nIndeed, this is a pathetic and insulting offering, with \"Scotsmen\" stereotyped that I am surprised the casting department didn't hire Russ Abbott to do his mad Scotsman impersonation.",
