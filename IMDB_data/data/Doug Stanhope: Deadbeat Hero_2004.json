If you have blind faith in cultural/spiritual/social/moral norms - stay away from Doug.\n\nIf, however, you are open minded and enjoy having your assumptions challenged in an uncompromising manner - then this is for you.\n\nI hate to compare one brilliant comic to another, but Doug reminded me of why the late Bill Hick was such a genius. They both have incredible sense of logic and right and - unlike almost any other stand-up - they do not try in any way to get the audience on their side. You either come with them on the journey and try to understand, or you get out. What balls.\n\nI didn't agree with everything Doug/Bill say but thank god someone was saying it. It is incredible how shocking someone telling the truth can be.\n\nDark, sick, disgusting, challenging, disturbing, difficult and utterly redeeming. Doug is one of a very few comics who truly test his audience and stretches the limits of what comedy is.\n\nIn society, since the dawn of civilisation, comedians (jesters and fools) were the only ones who were able to tell the truth to power. They were the only ones licenced to challenge social assumptions and get away with it - because people think it is just a joke. That's why people walk out of comedy shows like Dougs - because they think it's just entertainment. They think it is like switching on a sit-com, they want to switch their brains off and just watch and laugh at the bits with the canned laughter. This kind of comedy wont stoop to that level. It is not just empty entertainment.\n\nThe likes of Doug show comedy in its true form. It is an art. It is socially important. It is challenging and liberating. It is hilarious.",
