Annette Day plays Jill Conway who is sent away to Belgium to keep her away from Lambert and finding out her uncle (John Williams) is trying to steal her inheritance. Guess who ends up singing in Belgium? More trouble arises when Lambert is suspected of jewel smuggling. Nine songs try to save this movie. The better tunes are \"Baby, If You Give Me All Your Love\", \"City By Night\" and \"Long Legged Girl\". Elvis looks puffy and his leading lady is the least attractive of all his movie co-stars.",
