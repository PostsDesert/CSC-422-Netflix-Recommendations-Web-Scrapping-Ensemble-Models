Quotes are taken from Democrats in supposed support of a war in Iraq (predicated on intelligence provided by the Bush administration) and are seamlessly narrated by our helpful nobody ra-ra, 'my way or the highway', war mongering nobody commentator. The videos are graphic, real and disturbing, but out of place and badly analyzed.\n\nPlease, put your time to better use. This film will either make you hate 'Islamic Extremists', the 'Radical Left' or just yourself for giving this garbage the time of day.",
