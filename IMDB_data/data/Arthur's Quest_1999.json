And be sure, this is a film for kids around that age, a throwback to the old live-action family films that Disney was churning out in the late sixties and seventies.\n\nStill, there's enough to keep adults interested, for the dads there is the scantily clad Catherine Oxenberg, looking more like a supermodel Xena than a medieval sorceress and for the mums there is the young hero's working mother to empathise with.\n\nFor the rest of us, it's spotting all the holes in the plot! For instance, how are all the ancients from another century so familiar with modern age slang? Not to mention the fundamental flaw when the evil Morgana is defeated, if it was that easy, why not just do it from the start?\n\nThen again, that's rather unfair as we adults are not the intended audience and the kids it was aimed at, should like this.",
