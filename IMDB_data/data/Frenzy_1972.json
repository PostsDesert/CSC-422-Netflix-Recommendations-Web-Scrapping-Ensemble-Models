        "reviewBody": "\"Frenzy\" was Alfred Hitchcock's next-to-last film. And though it's not a great classic like \"Psycho\" and \"North by Northwest\", it's still a very good movie. After making mostly American movies for four decades, Hitchcock returned to his native Britain to make \"Frenzy\". It's about a series of murders that's devastating London. These murders have two things in common: 1) The victims are all women; and 2) they're all raped and then strangled with a neck-tie. When a marriage counselor is murdered this way, the police suspect the woman's ex-husband is the culprit. But actually the husband is innocent, and is forced to hide out from the cops. \"Frenzy\" has all the usual Hitchcock elements: thrills, suspense, comedy, and Hitchcock's cameo appearence. The two best scenes in the movie are the hilarious moments when the police inspector (who's heading up the investigation of the neck-tie murders) is served two gourmet dinners by his wife. These scenes are very funny. The comic moments is what gives \"Frenzy\" a edge over Hitchcock's previous film \"Topaz\". Plus, it's a more entertaining thriller.\n\n*** (out of four)",
