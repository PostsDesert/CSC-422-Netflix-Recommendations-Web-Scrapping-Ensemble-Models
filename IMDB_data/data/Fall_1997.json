        "reviewBody": "I absolutely hated this movie. The writer/director/leading `man' was the most unlikable character ever portrayed. To me it was quite obvious he was at least bisexual, and at times I was certain the `world's most beautiful woman' was a transvestite. Did he really let her penetrate him? And this is supposed to be sexy?\n\nI only watched this movie because it was so horrible I couldn't look away. I actually got more laughs out of this than anything.\n\nWho the hell was in charge of continuity? The scene in the beginning, when her hair is all frizzy in the cab, then she hands him a $20 for a $2.50 fare and gets out. He gets out and says `Yo!' (please!) Here hair is now OBVIOUSLY brushed straight..I was hooked. I had to watch this train wreck. `I don't want your twenty.I want to buy your dinner.'\n\nI don't believe the premise that there is a white, English speaking cabbie in New York, anymore than I believe any of the dialogue in this fecal epic.\n\nWhat the hell was that screaming at the end?\n\nThe ending gave me some hope because for a second I was certain he was going to be run over by a speeding car as he stood in the street. Of course he wasn't.\n\nNote to female readers: No man hugs a pillow and cries over his lost love. This guy is a little bitch.\n\nNote to the director/writer/actor: Your character is not cool, or even remotely believable, and your poetry is laughable.\n\nWhat the hell was her accent? Does anyone make a hat big enough to fit her enormous head?\n\nWhat about his `girlfriends'... Cardboard cutouts would have been more believable.\n\nThis movie sucked harder than my brand new Hoover. It is too late for me, but please spare yourself the two hours I spent on this waste of time. Call your mom instead.or check your girlfriend's dresser drawer for double-headed dildos."
