She gives us a radiant but guilt-ridden Kristin not far off the mark from the character in Undset's books. \n\nThe architectural details, costumes and various artifacts around the farm seem just right for the era. \n\nI felt disappointed when the film ended as I was eager to see the subsequent development of Kristin's character we see in the second and third volumes of Undset's trilogy. One can only hope that these, too, will come in time."
