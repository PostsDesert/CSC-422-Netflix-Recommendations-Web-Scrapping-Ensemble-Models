These are the kind of people who read books, listen to music, and watch TV shows just to create a mental checklist of all the things that are done wrong in their own brilliant opinions. So if you follow me so far, here's my brief review of The Core.\n\nMy reactions to the various big budget disaster movies of recent years have been varied. My expectations were low going into \"The Core\" because the trailer, while interesting, still made the movie look like major cheese potential. But I must say I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. For what it is, which is pure popcorn escapism fun, it works. The special effects and sets are excellent, the actors are all good, and the story was not nearly as hokey as I thought it would be.\n\nAaron Eckhart, Hillary Swank and Stanley Tucci are all pretty respectable actors, and they give the movie the substance that it may have otherwise lacked. Yes, the clich√© \"hacker nerd\" and military brass characters are a little old, but they don't ruin the experience. I have no idea how realistic or plausible the story is. But \"The Core\" is one of those entertaining movies that will take you away for a ride if you can suspend your disbelief. Thumbs up for a good effort."
