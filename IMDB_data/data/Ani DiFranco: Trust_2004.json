Great versions of \"Phase,\" \"Grand Canyon,\" \"Coming Up,\" and \"Gods Country\" are illustrated by some great cinematography by Danny Clinch, also known for his awesome work with Phish (see the Specimens of Beauty DVD that came with their album \"Undermind\"). There are interesting insights from fans (replete with \"This is what a Feminist Looks Like\" t-shirts), Ani herself, former presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich, and bassist Todd Sickafoose. This is an excellent DVD to get whether you're a hardcore fan, or someone wondering what the buzz is all about.",
