The acting is wonderful - especially by Robert Downey Jnr. who, when you think about it, really plays five characters (his character plus the other four main characters when they enter his body).\n\nHeart and Souls deserves more recognition than it has gotten, and if you haven't seen it yet, i recommend you rent the video and watch it - you won't be disappointed!"
