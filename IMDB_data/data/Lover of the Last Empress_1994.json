        "reviewBody": "This is a grand production for Wong Jin movies, and many Hong Kong luminaries stars in this rather epic story. I'm not sure if it was released as Cat 3 film, but the story is mostly about what happens in the bedroom between Hui (Chingmy Yau), and the emperor (plus the prince).\n\nThis is the most pornographic of all the movies I've seen featuring Chingmy Yau, and as if it was to be the last hurrah of her career, and the Hong Kong cinema as it was prior to repatriation of Hong Kong to China, she (almost) bears it all in this movie. \n\nAs it's usual for Wong Jin, the quality of the movie is high, and this one has expensive look to it as well. You can see that the people were still \"free\" when this movie was made, as they have bit more flamboyant attitude in acting. If you watch the more recent Hong Kong cinema, the acting is very stiff, and actor's attitude is much more tense. I kind of miss these old school Hong Kong movies.\n\nThe story is basically a filler between the love scenes, and you should watch this movie to enjoy Chingmy Yau's sex appeal before she got married in 1997. There are many actors in this movie, but 90% of the acting (and dialogues although dubbed) is done by Chingmy Yau.\n\nBeautiful Chingmy Yau gives one of her last performances in this movie. She came a long ways from her young girl days in her earlier career to a fully mature woman in her later movies like this one. \n\nIf you're a Chingmy Yau fan, you wouldn't want to miss this movie.",
