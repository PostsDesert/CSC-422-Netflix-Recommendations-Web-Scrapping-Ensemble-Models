The first thing I noticed while watching \"Desecration\" was how much thought must have went into each shot. From the lighting set-up to the camera angles, Tomaselli's vision comes across in a visually stunning fashion. As for the story, it seems to move slowly and cautiously, at times far too much, and this tends to take away from the picture's prowess. Confusing as it may be, \"Desecration\" is worth a viewing, if only to enjoy the director's take on \"How a low budget film should look\", as it is eons above it's contemporaries. Well acted by the unknown cast, I recommend this film to anyone looking for a little something different from the genre, but don't try to figure out the story too hard or you will end up with a headache...",
