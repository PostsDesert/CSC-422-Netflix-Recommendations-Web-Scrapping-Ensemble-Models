        "reviewBody": "A modestly effective supernatural thriller based on the James Herbert novel, and directed by veteran Lewis Gilbert. Weakness is the over lighting of many scenes that would have been much better in low key, but there are moments of shock that work well, especially in the early sequences. Quinn is somewhat wooden, and its left to Kate Beckinsale to add zest and glamor, which she does effectively, with several nude scenes and some moments of steamy sex. Lewis Gilbert directs without enthusiasm, though at times can we see traces of his earlier and better screen work. Finally the plot which has a major twist at the ending, is full of red herrings and pot holes, which makes it less than believable. A precursor to \"The Others\" which handles a similar situation with more classic flair, better cast and direction.",
