As for the story, it is a fairy tale, totally unrealistic. But it is a very, very romantic fairy tale. I'm an overage, overweight, cynical old lady, but I still cried through half the movie. If you watch this movie, have a big box of tissues, a big box of chocolates, and a large dose of the willing suspension of disbelief. If you have even one romantic bone in your body, you'll love it. If you can't suspend your disbelief, skip it - you will just be irritated.",
