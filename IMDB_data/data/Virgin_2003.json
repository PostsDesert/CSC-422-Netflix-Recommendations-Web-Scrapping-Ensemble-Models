        "reviewBody": "I was fortunate enough to catch this film with a friend at the East Hampton film festival almost one year ago. \"Virgin\" is not always an easy film to watch, but it is one that courageously expresses both the despair and hope of adolescence and young adulthood. \n\n\"Virgin\" did not entertain me, it moved me. Writer/Director Deborah Kampmeier immediately takes her audience into the deep end. She does not stay in safe and shallow waters, but apparently believes that our hearts and minds will expand to take it all in. This belief inspired me to do so.\n\nMs. Kampmeier's symbolism is unsettling and brilliant. If you are willing to think and feel (and have the heart and courage to do so), you will not be disappointed. Even now, almost one year later, I am still moved and reminded of images in her film that express the human struggle and condition.\n\nAs the mother of two teenage daughters (and two adolescent sons), I am grateful for the opportunity to be able to share \"VIRGIN\" with them. Although the film is too intense for my boys to see at this time, I am relieved to be able to share a film with my daughters that does not focus on the troubled but \"very sexy\" longed for experiences (of most teenage girls) more evident in a film such as \"THIRTEEN\", but rather truly addresses the typical teen's need to be seen and loved through a heart wrenchingly honest and believable performance by her main character, Elizabeth Moss.\n\nThis film reverberates long after you leave the theatre."
