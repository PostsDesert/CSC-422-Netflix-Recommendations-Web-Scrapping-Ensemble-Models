It's one of the best short films I've seen in the last few years, and kind of goes past being a short. Unique, well-done, and filled with detail. If you like to think when you see a scary movie, then don't pass this one. I still have yet to see the full 35 minute one, and now I can't wait to see it. Unfortunately, we don't have it up here. I bet it's fresh though!",
