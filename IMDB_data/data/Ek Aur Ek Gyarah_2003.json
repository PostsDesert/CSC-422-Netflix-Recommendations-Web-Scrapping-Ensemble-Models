        "reviewBody": "Ek Aur Ek Gyarah (transl. One and one is eleven) is a 2003 Indian action comedy film by David Dhawan. The film stars Sanjay Dutt, Govinda, Jackie Shroff, Amrita Arora, Nandini Singh, Ashish Vidhyarthi, Rajpal Yadav and Gulshan Grover.\n\nTwo petty thieves, take shelter in the house of a Major. They are forced to deceive him when, a gangster, kidnaps their mother to get his brother released from prison.\n\nI have seen Haseena Maan Jayegi and Jodi No.1 of the trio of David Dhawan, Sanjay Dutt and Govinda and both the films were hilariously entertaining and funny and I have had very high hopes with this film also but this film was a major disappointment. It seems that neither the director nor the actors were over from the hangover of Jodi no.1 and it looked like the pale sequel of Jodi No.1 because the plot and the dialogue delivery looked like the copy of Jodi No.1 but comedy is missing this time. The film has some great comic actors like Govinda, Sanjay Dutt and Rajpal Yadav but failed to leave impression, barring only very minimal funny scenes the film is boring, clumsy and monotonous.\n\nThe plot of the film is very similar to that of Jodi no.1 and execution is also similar but the only difference in both the film is that the Jodi No.1 was comical and entertaining. Dialogue delivery in both the films were also similar but on the one hand it looked impressive in the earlier film but annoys in this film.\n\nThe screenplay of the film is mediocre and cliched and the music is also poor in taste. Acting is average with Govinda, Sanjay Dutt and Rajpal Yadav looked less impressive while Amrita Arora and Nandini Singh irritates. Jackie Shroff, Ashish Vidhyarthi and Gulshan Grover were wasted.\n\nClimax of the film is also boring and doesn't make any impact, this film is a huge disappointment. The hopes were high but the disappointment is even higher.",
