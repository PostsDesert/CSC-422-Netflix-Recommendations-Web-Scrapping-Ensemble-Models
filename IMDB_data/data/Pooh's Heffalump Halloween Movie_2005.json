        "reviewBody": "It is Halloween time in the hundred acre woods and it is also Lumpy's first Halloween. As the rest of the gang prepare him for the night he becomes scared and only is brave with his best friend Roo by his side. The plot thickens when Pooh eats all the candy meant for trick-or-treating and Lumpy and Roo decide to catch the Gobloon to wish for enough candy for everyone, and a Poohish adventure begins. The film is not a stroke of genius but it will entertain your children. There are some classic Pooh moments that will bring a smile to the parents face but all in all the kids will enjoy far more than you. Which isn't really a bad thing. The DVD has a few special features including a pass the pumpkin game which is a lot like hot potato. There is also a Heffalump Halloween party planner and on the DVD-Rom you can decorate your own pumpkin. Not Earth shattering but if your kids like the Heffalump movie, then they will enjoy this very much. 7/10",
