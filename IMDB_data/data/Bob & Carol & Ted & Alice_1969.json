It's got some good lines, some good jokes and very good timing on delivery of those jokes. I'm undecided on the aunt and uncle yet but I like Abishola and her son both. I even like her co-workers that she talks to about some of the Bob/husband/life things. Vernee Watson-Johnson is one of her co-workers and I've liked her since I saw her in Welcome Back Kotter. There are some strong actors in this show with good scripting and funny, endearing lines. The characters have a real quality about them and the actors are good enough to get you involved in the show.",
