        "reviewBody": "Allen and Bonham Carter adopt a boy of such genius that Allen sets out to find his real mother who turns out to be a prostitute and porn movie star and not the sharpest pencil in the box.\n\nOne of Allen's better comedies held up high by a luscious performance by Sorvino - you just can't wait until she's back on screen. As usual the support cast is impressive and Allen's interplay with Sorvino is as witty as he's been for some time. In addition, the use of a Greek chorus lead by F Murray Abraham who largely counsel Allen on his life is nicely handled.",
