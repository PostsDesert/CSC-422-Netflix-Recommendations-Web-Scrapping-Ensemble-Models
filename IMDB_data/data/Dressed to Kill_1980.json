I like the story it was wonderful & I it took me almost after 75 min of watching movie to take guess who could be the mysterious killer and when I find out I got quiet excited although 10 minutes later everybody knew who's the killer. but all in all I enjoyed that and I could call it one of the best Mystery, Thriller movies I have ever seen of curse with breath taking ending. I should say the acting of Michael Caine & Nancy Allen were perfect.",
