        "reviewBody": "However obscure this tight little band might appear by the lack of votes here at IMDb, they have been making significant contributions to the Bluegrass music scene for over a decade. With soundtrack installments to films such as Twister, and Oh Brother Where Art Thou, I am truly surprised that their popularity has not gained more momentum. This particular illustration of their talent is a filmed concert in Louisville Kentucky's Palace Theater where the audience is enormously receptive for obvious reasons. Being a native of Kentucky myself I probably have a bias when it comes to this type of music. Be that as it may, the concert in its own right is a wonderful example of the modernization of Bluegrass music and here is a group that never over steps its boundaries as do many neo-Bluegrass bands. If you have an interest in Bluegrass music or want to spend a couple of hours with a group of musicians who will truly entertain you, take it from an old hillbilly you won't be disappointed by these folks.",
