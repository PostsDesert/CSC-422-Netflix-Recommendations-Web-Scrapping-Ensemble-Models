They really need to stay away from the \"Ditsy-Valley Girl from California\" rolls. If you are a MK and A fan then of course you'll need to see this movie. Just be prepared. They dont play the \"cute and smart\" characters they are used to but instead \"cute and ditsy\". They still have the style just not the brains. I'm sure they will probably be back to more quality roles in their next movie \"When In Rome\". I just pray they know to stay away from the ditsy roles and put some brains in these characters!"
