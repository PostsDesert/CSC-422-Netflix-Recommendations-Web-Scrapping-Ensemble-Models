        "reviewBody": "I am, and have always been, a fan of the \"Gremlins\" movies. Especially since they manage to combine comedy and horror in a most satisfying manner, but most importantly because of the Mogwai and the gremlins themselves.\n\nIf you enjoyed the 1984 \"Gremlins\" movie, then you will definitely also like the \"Gremlins 2: The New Batch\" from 1990.\n\nThis is a direct continuation of the first movie in a way, and the writers managed to come up with a story angle that supports the transition between the first and second movie quite well.\n\nIn \"Gremlins 2: The New Batch\" Billy (played by Zach Galligan) and Kate (played by Phoebe Cates) have moved to New York and are working for the Clamp company and work in an advanced skyscraper. When Gizmo finds his way to Billy, and is accidentally exposed to water, New York is in for a repeat of the incident that happened at Kingston Falls.\n\nOne might think, at a glance, that I have already seen this in the first movie. And you are right, to a certain extend. Sure, there are similarities to the first movie, but everything in \"Gremlins 2: The New Batch\" is taken one step further. More gremlins, more mutations, more mayhem, more comedy, and so forth.\n\nWhat I love about \"Gremlins 2: The New Batch\" is the great ideas for changing the gremlins, as they are exposed to the various formulas and genetic materials from a research company also house in the Clamp Tower. The gremlins designs are just fantastic, and the creativity behind these ideas is just fabulous.\n\nThere are also some great performances in this movie. Of course, first and foremost, it was nice to have Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates return to their roles. But it was equally great to have Dick Miller return as well, despite for a small role only (just as in the first movie). Furthermore, there were some memorable performances by Christopher Lee, Robert Prosky, John Glover and Robert Picardo.\n\nThe storyline in \"Gremlins 2: The New Batch\" is also good, and it matches the craziness, intensity and the unique style of the first movie very well, and then adds a new element to that.\n\n\"Gremlins 2: The New Batch\" is a movie that you can watch again and again, just like the first movie. And this is one of those types of movies that everyone is familiar with, even if they haven't actually seen the movie. I think that these two movies are definitely something that everyone should take the time to sit down and watch.",
