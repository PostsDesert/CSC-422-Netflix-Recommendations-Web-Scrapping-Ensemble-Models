        "reviewBody": "This is a very good action film, but it could have been so much better! Ji Chun Hua is fantastic as usual as the lead villain giving a stong and powerful performance! Do Siu Chun is good as the lead (Iron Bridge San), but it would have been much better if his sidekick Taam Chui (Kuang) was the lead for this one (he's a better actor and much better martial artist than Siu Chun!) .Unfortunately this film drags a little at times and Taam Chui's mega martial arts talent is completely wasted! It's a real crime for this guy to be in a film and not bust a move! (his kicks are amazing!) . I'm suprised he hasn't done more stuff, he looks like Jet Li (should appeal) can fight even better and can act! why isn't he more famous? Still this is a great action film, full of well choreographed fights, some good acting (mainly from Ji Chun Hua and Taam Chui) and a good solid story, though not for the Squeamish (some brutal parts!) .Though this film's not well known it's well worth a look and a must see for Kung Fu fans!",
