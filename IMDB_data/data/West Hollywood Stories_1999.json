        "reviewBody": "Forget the one star rating--what were they expecting: Hamlet? West Hollywood Stories is entertaining fluff, to be sure, but it's entertaining GAY fluff, and sadly you won't find any of these stories on your daytime soaps. The writing/the acting/the camera work--no worse than you'd find on Days of Our Lives, which is to say it's not brilliant, but I didn't find a single \"bad\" performance, and some of the actors are actually pretty good, and pretty good looking, and a pretty face can excuse quite a lot. More than anything, West Hollywood Stories is a tantalizing peek at what might be if prime time, or even daytime, paid more attention to the 10% focused on in this \"what if\" soap. Too bad that only four episodes were made. I'd like to have seen more of these stories.",
