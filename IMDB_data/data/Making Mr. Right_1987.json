A image consultant named Frankie Stone(Ann Magnuson) who just dumped her philandering congressman boyfriend(Ben Masters). Is asked to help an android named Ulysses(John Malkovich), to help polish his social graces, before he is unvaled to the public. Much of the dismay of his of his creator Dr. Jeff Peters(Also John Malkovich). A good romantic comedy of it's time. Ann Magnuson is great. John Malkovich is terrific in duel roles has the sweet and sincere android Ulysses, and has the uptight and cynical Dr. Jeff Peters. A great movie to rent for your date."
