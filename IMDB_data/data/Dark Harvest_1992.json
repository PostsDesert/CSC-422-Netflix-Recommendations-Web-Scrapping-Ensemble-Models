        "reviewBody": "I am an eclectic lover of movies. Once I like all the genres, I usually try to locate unknown films, independents, awarded in minor festivals, or having a good actor or director, because many times I find hidden gems. Yesterday, for example, I saw an excellent Vietnam war unknown movie called `The Iron Triangle'. Sometimes, I commit mistake, and the movie is not as good as I expect, but amen, it would be very easy selecting classics only. I found this used `Dark Harvest' on VHS on sale in a rental and it was so cheap that I decided to buy it. The cover, with a scarecrow, is nice. However, the film is so cheesy, so amateurish made, so ridiculous, that I did not finish watching it. Maybe I try again, just to see how bad a movie can be. Indeed, it is not a movie, but maybe a joke, or a project of students in an university, or maybe a home film, I am not sure. But I also do not know how such a crap found a minor Brazilian distributor (`Opção'), which had the courage of releasing such a trash without any fear of the market rejection. Indirectly I am promoting this junk thing, but if you reader, do not believe me, take a chance and try to see whether you can go until the `The End' of this trashy stuff. My vote is one (the lowest allowable in IMDB).\n\nTitle (Brazil): `O Campo do Terror' (`The Field of Terror')",
