        "reviewBody": "Burt Reynolds plays Paul Crewe, a reprehensible character discovering, in a prison, dignity and esteem You see him, at the beginning of the movieas a rising starbeating up a woman, stealing her car, drunken driving, insulting cops in a bar, resisting arrest He's seen so funny when he insulted the miniature cop who's about to arrest him, while the cop's partner is laughing openly \n\nEddie Albert was very charming when he meets Paul Crewe at his arrival to Citrus State Prison Aldrich wanted to play Warden Hazen as the guy who had the veneer of normalcy, the veneer of being a good executive, the veneer of keeping it all together till it starts unraveling He really was just a despicable, oily, warden type In one game scene, we see him over and over again, getting up just with that same look of shock on his face \n\nEd Lauter (Captain Knauer) is wonderful He runs the football team He is a bad guy and he represents everything that is wrong with that prison system and everything else He changes as a result And to see that is just so delightful He's got the classic Ed Lauter's scene at the end James Hampton plays Caretaker, the character who brings the team all together and pushes Burt's character ahead to win the game \n\nRay Nitschke plays the toughest, meanest linebacker in football Richard Kiel, Bob Tessier, Charles Tyner, Michael Conrad, and Harry Caesar give the film a certain veracity, you almost thing you are in jail",
