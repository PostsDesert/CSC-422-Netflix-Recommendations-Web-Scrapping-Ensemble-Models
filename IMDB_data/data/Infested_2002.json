        "reviewBody": "Amy Jo Johnson, the pink ranger herself and Zack Galligan of Gremlins and Waxwork fame, both put in appearances in this flick. When I see a movie poster with absolutely none of the main characters on it, there are only two explanations. Either the filmmakers are being secretive and hip, or the movie itself was hastily thrown together and they couldn't get their actors to show up for a photo shoot after it wrapped. This would be the latter. There isn't much to say about this film, really bad CGI vampiric bugs show up, due to some poorly explained government back-story. Stupid people do stupid things and don't hang around for a sequel. The bugs apparently fly into a human body, breed and control the carcass as a zombie to stay out of the sun. I would love an explanation as to how these bugs are capable of re-animating the dead. I have never seen such completely nonthreatening zombies. I do recommend a watch however, it was fun to see Zack Galligan doing his B-movie thing, and yes Amy Jo does have a rather lengthy shower scene, but sorry guys, the childhood fantasy of seeing her in the raw goes unfulfilled. Watch it with friends in the mood to laugh, but for a scare, look elsewhere.",
