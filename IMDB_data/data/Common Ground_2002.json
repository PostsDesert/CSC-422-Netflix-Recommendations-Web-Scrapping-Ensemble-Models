        "reviewBody": "In Buenos Aires, a few days before traveling to Spain with his beloved wife Liliana Rovira (Mercedes Sampietro) to visit their son Pedro (Carlos Santamaria), the leftist Literature Professor Fernando Robles (Federico Luppi) is compulsory retired in the University, and he concludes that it is impossible to live with his pension. The crisis in Argentina does not allow Fernando to get a new job, and his wife decides to sell her family's apartment and move to a small farm in Cordoba to reduce their expenses. Once in the country, while adapting to the new lifestyle, a tragedy happens.\n\n\"Lugares Comunes\" is a very beautiful, critical, human, sensitive and real film about love, life, adaptation and convictions in the third age. The story takes place in Argentina, but could be in Brazil or any South American country, where in general people can not keep their status with their retirement pension, being forced to continue working to survive, or to fall from middle-class to very poor class. This touching narrative has a perfect pace and flows naturally, supported by the impressive performances of Federico Luppi and Mercedes Sampietro. All the characters are credible and beautiful (with the exception of the head of the university), and this movie is a gem. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Lugares Comuns\"(\"Common Places\")",
