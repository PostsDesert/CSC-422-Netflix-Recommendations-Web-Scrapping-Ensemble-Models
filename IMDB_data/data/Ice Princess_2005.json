        "reviewBody": "I'm going to \"skate\" over some of the more obvious flaws... Yes, Casey's physics project is laughable. Yes, the message -- that talent and independent spirit will shine, and that parents and children must respect each other's dreams -- is hackneyed. Sure, this is a feel-good movie aimed at tweens. But here's an ugly secret: Many an emotionally arrested adult derives guilty pleasure from these perky underdog flicks. \n\nThe compelling reason to watch IP, however, is two old (sorry, older) pros -- and one up-and-comer. We all knew Joan Cusack could act (indeed she's one of our top comedic thespians), but who knew she could believably play an initially unsympathetic tight-assed \"Type A\" mom? And Kim Cattrall portrays the conniving Tonya Harding-esquire bitch (with the requisite heart of gold) admirably. Watching these two pros interact is quite the treat: Note how expressive their faces are, even when delivering (or reacting to) dialogue that skates on thin ice indeed.\n\nMichelle Trachtenberg makes a appealing protagonist, but the revelation is Hayden Panettiere who perfectly embodies (both physically and psychologically) the driven golden girl (with that requisite heart of gold, natch). She cemented her status as a young actress to watch in Bring It On 3 (yet another perky, underrated underdog flick... that almost matched the cutes of the original). Additional kudos to the energetic monsters who portray the Jumping Shrimp and Zoe the punker pincushion who skates to Pink.\n\nHardly a gold medalist, and admittedly formulaic, but certainly deserving of better reviews than it received upon release. Watch those three (well, five) gals go at it and you'll agree.",
