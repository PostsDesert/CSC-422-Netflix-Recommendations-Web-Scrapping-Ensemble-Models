Nobody actually believes him and they assume it to be part of his condition.\n\nIt's a functional dark thriller for a little while. When Chloe is reluctant to get naked in front of Frank, it becomes obvious that she is lying about everything. At that point, the movie needs to start laying out the twists and turns. It feels like a lot of it is left to the last act. It's a lot of jamming in stuff. By the final twist, I'm not sure that any of it makes sense. This ends up being nothing more than a B-movie thriller.",
