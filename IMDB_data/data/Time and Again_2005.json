        "reviewBody": "Fifty years pass, and two former lovers find they're living in the same place.\n\nIt's a pretty good story, brought to life by some tremendous acting. I think it goes to show that true love never dies.\n\nThe thirty minute running time is a little restrictive, the story seems to come and go too quickly, meaning that some of the events feel a little too fast. A pity it wasn't sixty minutes long, they could have made the anger and love a little more intense.\n\nSian Phillips is one of the best, no question, she is a class act, absolutely legendary, and she's awesome here, you really do feel the venom. Brigit Forsyth is equally as good, I'm so used to her sour faced character in Still Open all hours, it's great to see the softer side of her acting.\n\nFor a short, it's very good, just a little time limited, 6/10.",
