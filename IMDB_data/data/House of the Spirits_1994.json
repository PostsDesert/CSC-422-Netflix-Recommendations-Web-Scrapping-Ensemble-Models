Other then viserys every other characters felt bland compared to got. Dialogues and interactions weren't as good as got.\n\nThose are my main complaints other then that a well written show. And an outstanding cinematography.\n\nDidn't have many great characters It had but not good as got.\n\nGoods >Great acting >Viserys >Cinematography >Direction >Writing\n\nBads >Pacing >Time jumps\n\nHotd was good but It wasn't as good as it's predecessor but i hope the ending will be better then it's predecessor....",
