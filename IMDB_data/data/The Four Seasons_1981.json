Alda, who wrote and directed, assembles a veteran cast of colorful couples spending their quarterly vacations together during one memorable year of change and confrontations of middle age craziness with deft and frequently funny aplomb. The choice to use Vivaldi's `Four Seasons' and the beautiful scenery only underscores the theme perfectly. Trivial note: the college-aged girls the group visit for parents' day are actually Alda's real-life daughters."
