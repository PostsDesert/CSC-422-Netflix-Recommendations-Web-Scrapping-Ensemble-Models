It seems that this series must be geared toward a very immature audience by explicit nudity, explicit sex acts, and unbelievable sexual situations. The show's core actors are very good when given good dialogue. The special guest stars have also been fun to watch. But the writers seem to have lost something along the way with what mature adults want to spend quality TV time viewing. I will not waste anymore time with Nip/Tuck unless the storyline is reined in. My time is too precious for the D-class stuff shown in the opening for Season 4. I am extremely disappointed."
