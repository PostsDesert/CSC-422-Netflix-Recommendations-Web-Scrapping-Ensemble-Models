        "reviewBody": "A very true-to-life look at the urban Latino life in the North East. Anyone raised in those areas of NYC, NJ, MA, or CT, will tell you so.\n\nIt's so rich in story & the characters are so easy to relate to, I just wish it was longer. Everyone's performance was great, & very realistic. Lauren Velez, Jon Seda, Jesse Borrego, Lisa Vidal, Vincent Laresca, & legendary diva Rita Moreno, brought this lil' number to life. Griffn Dune was great as well. Along with cameos of music artists Barrio Boyzz, Jerry Rivera, Fat Joe, & Broadway \"Rent\" star Daphne Rubin-Vega (formerly of late 80's Freestyle Dance/Pop girl-trio, Pajama Party). This film is one of my fav's & I have seen & experienced very similar situations growing up in those areas, so it was kool, & can relate. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, especially the urban Latino audience. If you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for!"
