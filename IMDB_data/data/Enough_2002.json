        "reviewBody": "I went in to this movie expecting it to be fairly light and fun \"victim gets her own back\" vibe. But that is not what this movie is: it is so much better!\n\nWe are sucked right into the victim's world, and it is all heart and all real; we share in the giving of trust and the great times...and this sets us up to fully feel the sucker-punch of betrayal.\n\nI haven't been in this sort of predicament so I cannot tell you that it is factual...but I sure as nuts believe it could be. This movie was able to immerse me into the abject fear for one's safety and desperation for escape and...just a life!\n\nI feel like I got a close-up education on abuse and violence in relationships.\n\nI don't know when I was so terrified in a movie (or in real life) - to my credit I do not purposefully put myself through horror movies for kicks (ie I do not watch them). This movie had me shouting and kept me up at night out of angst and it made me cry because of the realness of this type of abuse in the real world, which I got to taste.\n\nGreat, positive ending - which it did need, sending out a note of hope.\n\nI have kept comments fairly vague so as to not spoil the movie for you.\n\nActing was superb, esp by J-Lo!, music score was amazing and added richness, editing and the way the movie was put together was a little quirky in my opinion but it worked! Filmography brought you right in, as it should have in this thriller.\n\nKudos to the team behind this and I'm so glad I discovered it ...so many years later.",
