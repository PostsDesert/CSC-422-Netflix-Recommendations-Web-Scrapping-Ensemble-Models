        "reviewBody": "This show is a combination of several shows but it is pure fun and outrageously hilarious as well. Its part Carol Burnett,the hijinks of In Living Color and MAD TV,the wit of Saturday Night Live,and the stylish settings of Flip Wilson and Steve Harvey. Basically Cedric The Entertainer has brought the variety show format back to its prime which hasn't been seen like this in a long time. It is a Wednesday night laugh out loud riot especially the part where Cedric plays the food serving old woman who insults people and the part where actress Wendy Raquel Robinson plays a ghetto mama who does a hilarious court segment. Its a hilarious half-hour of fun."
