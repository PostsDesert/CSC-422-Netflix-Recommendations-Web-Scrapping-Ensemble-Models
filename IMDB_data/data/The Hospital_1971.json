We've all heard about (or maybe even experienced) some quirky stuff in hospitals, but this one (fashioned by Paddy Chayefsky) really takes the cake. \n\nSeldom has there been such an odd assortment of patients, staff and docs under one roof. Agreed some reforms are needed in the medical profession which warrant exposing. \n\nBut Chayefsky creates a circus, replete with sexually maladjusted interns, an Indian medicine man performing out-patient rites, and a mad killer stalking the corridors for victims and bopping them over the head. That George C. Scott keeps a straight face must be one of the great acting feats of '71.\n\nThe script goes so over-the-top that it gives that term a new meaning. Enough to make one want to cancel their Medicare and go alternative all the way.\n\nWhere's that grape seed extract and Noni juice?"
