Their eventual shift to \"a life of crime\" - well, being bookies anyway, is fresh and interesting. To criticize that the bookie aspect of the film is not \"realistic\", is to miss the point entirely. This film hits the mark on the struggle to live and thrive in Manhattan under difficult circumstances. Production values are low as I understand this was an indie feature.",
