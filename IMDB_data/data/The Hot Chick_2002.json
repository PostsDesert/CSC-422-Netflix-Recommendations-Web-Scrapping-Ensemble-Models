The movie, I must say, was madly hilarious. At some points, I was rolling into the other seat.\n\nIts not very easy for an actor to portray someone of the opposite sex, however, Schnieder did it better than anyone else could. \n\n This is a great movie, however, if you are a 'party pooper' like the last reviewer...with no sense of humor...you more than likely wont like this movie..\n\nGreat comedy!!"
