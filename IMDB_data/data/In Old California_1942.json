On the way he angers big-shot Albert Dekker, who attempts to blackball Wayne, only to find him partner up with his girlfriend, leading to the inevitable love-triangle, skulduggery, and showdown.\n\nOne of the minor Wayne westerns cranked out by Republic Pictures in the nineteen-forties, this mild programmer is pleasant enough entertainment, though nothing really to write home about. It could have been a little better.\n\nThe Duke is a bit softer than usual, in a role that's a lot different than you're used to seeing, that of an educated, suit-wearing gentleman.",
