        "reviewBody": "Bar none (or is it \"Beer none\") the best movie of all time! Cornball humor abounds when two brothers, Bob and Doug Mc Kenzie help a young heiress named Pamela reclaim her family's brewery from the evil Brewmeister Smith (who plans to take over the world by putting a mind control drug in all the beer he makes) and his hapless assistant (who just happens to be her Uncle). This movie actually has a plot, though you'll probably be too busy laughing to care. An unexpected cameo by Mel Blanc is a nice surprise, and Max Von Sydow makes a convincingly sinister antagonist. This IS Canada, so the hero is a handsome hockey player nicknamed Rosey who falls in love (of course) with Pamela. Though it's hard to pick just one favorite scene,one of the best bits begins in the courtroom and ends in the loonie bin! Anyway, grab some jelly donuts, sit back, relax, and soon you'll be saying with the rest of us \"TAKE OFF YOU HOSER!\""
