        "reviewBody": "One of the reasons I would recommend 'Punch-Drunk Love' is Adam Sandler. For the first time he is the best thing in a movie and I must admit he does a tremendous job with his character, named Barry Egan. He has the same aggressive outbursts he has in his comedies but here they fit his character and the story. He seems like a pretty normal guy although you see something in his face, something ready to come out, and when it comes you can almost understand it.\n\nThe story is a love story, in a way. The love interest is Lena (Emily Watson). They are both different and therefore there is a chance it could work. Another part of the story involves a sex line that Barry called. They have his credit card number and everything and force him from time to time to donate money. How this story goes from there is not for me to reveal but it gives us some very unexpected moments.\n\nThat is one of the other good things in this movie. Most of the time you don't know and can't even guess what will happen next. It is another reason to see this movie, although I do think it has some boring moments as well. The story develops slow and that makes it a movie not all people will like. If you like Adam Sandler-movies like 'Mr. Deeds' or 'Big Daddy' I think you should skip 'Punch-Drunk Love'. If you like other movies from director Paul Thomas Anderson I am not sure. I liked 'Boogie Nights' and 'Magnolia' a lot better, but you might want to give it a chance.",
