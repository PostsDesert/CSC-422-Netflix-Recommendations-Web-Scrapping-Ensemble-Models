I enjoy the comedy between Bette Midler and Dennis Farina, who are both fantastic, but watch this movie for Paula Marshall and Danny Nucci. They are both hilarious and sweet. This movie may not be the most popular one, but I'd rather watch this than many of the romantic comedies that have come out recently. Rent it, especially if you're a romantic comedy fan! It's great!!!"
