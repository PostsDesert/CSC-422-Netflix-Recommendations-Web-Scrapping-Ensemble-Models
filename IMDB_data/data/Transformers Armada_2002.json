I loved the controls (once I figured them out). Every bit of the game was great. However, it was a bit too short. At least it was in the rookie mode. It was harder than I thought in the rookie mode, but I thought it was enjoyable nonetheless. Even though I am a self-proclaimed purist of the Transformer franchise, I enjoyed the minicons and the extras found in the game. I give the game 4 out of 5 or a 9 1/2 out of 10.\n\nThank you for listening!"
