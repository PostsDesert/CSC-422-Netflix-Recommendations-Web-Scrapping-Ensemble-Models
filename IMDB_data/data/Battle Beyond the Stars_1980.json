They aren't afraid to steal from any source, EVERYTHING goes into the pot as long as it's got sparkle, splash, and action. This particular film works real well and I absolutely fell for it when I heard a phrase of music lifted directly from \"Alexander Nevsky\". It's pure, simple (repeat, simple) fun. The producers of \"Battlefield Earth\" could have learned something about making entertaining SF movies from repeated viewings of \"Battle Beyond the Stars.\""
