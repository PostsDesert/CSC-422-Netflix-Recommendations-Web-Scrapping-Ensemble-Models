        "reviewBody": "\"Iron Maze\" has an intriguing script: the story of an attempted murder is unraveled through a series of conflicting flashbacks. Sadly, this script has been poorly directed, poorly photographed and poorly acted. The result is a muddled, unpleasant and self-indulgent film. Jeff Fahey is typically obnoxious, while Bridget Fonda looks pretty and enigmatic, but she doesn't really have to act to achieve those qualities; her actual performance is closer to a zombie than a living human being. And J.T. Walsh plays (surprise!) an officer of the law. The movie also has xenophobic political implications (\"those evil Japanese!\"), which it tries to reverse in the final scene. (*1/2)",
