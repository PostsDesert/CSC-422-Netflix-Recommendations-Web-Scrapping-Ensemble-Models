        "reviewBody": "Hamilton is genuinely funny in this movie. That is much more than I can say for the next one he did, Zorro, the Gay Blade. It was atrocious. But in this one, he was honestly good, as was Susan St. James. Her success on television in my opinion stemmed from her performance in this movie. MacMillian and Wife was a wonderful series, but she shined brightest in this movie.\n\nThe VHS release, however, has one major change I neither understand, nor can stomach. That wonderful climax where the two of them are dancing to the song, \"I Love the Nightlife\" and he is attempting to use his Vampyric powers on Suntime (St. James), has been negatively altered!\n\nIt now no longer contains that memorable song and the soundtrack has been changed to another song for that scene. I was highly disappointed with this change! It degraded the quality of the experience to the point of making it worthless!\n\nIf you can find this movie in its original format (before the change, that is) this movie rates an 8.2/10.\n\nAfter the change, it's not worth a 1.0/10 from...\n\nthe Fiend :.",
