She plays a crazy teenager who has a crush on a guy who lives in a guesthouse. In her selfish pursuit of the object of her affection, she makes the guy's life a living hell. She also makes the life miserable for anyone who tries to \"steal\" the guy from her. I think Silverstone fit her role perfectly. The plot was very good as well, and I was always wondering what Silversone's character (Alicia) would do next. This movie gets a solid 8 from me.",
