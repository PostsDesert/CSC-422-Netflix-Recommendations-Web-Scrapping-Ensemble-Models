        "reviewBody": "This movie begins with a happily married man named \"Tom Redding\" (Marc Singer) who works as a researcher studying sexual stimuli on the human body at a laboratory known as the Neurology Institute. One day he is called in to his supervisor's office and is handed a new project authored by a woman named \"Dr. Claire Archer\" (Lisa Pescia). Naturally, since the new project involves more revenue for the laboratory Tom is more than happy to lend whatever assistance he can. However, he soon learns that Dr. Archer has more on her mind than just research and the two of them soon begin to have a sexual relationship with one another. Although he initially believes that it is just a casual affair he soon realizes that it isn't as easy to break things off as he first thought. Likewise, he also doesn't quite fathom how emotionally unstable Dr. Archer can be when facing rejection. And that is when the trouble starts. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought this was a rather interesting drama which benefited greatly from the performance of Lisa Pescia who managed to combine a certain amount of sexual tension with some dark and sinister overtones in the process. Admittedly, the subject matter isn't original but I believe it is definitely worth a watch for viewers who might be interested in a film of this type. Slightly above average.",
