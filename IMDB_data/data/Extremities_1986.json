        "reviewBody": "While this movie is a good movie, it has the T.V. movie of the week feel to it. The play by William Mastrosimone is tons better, and has a much better ending.\n\nFarrah proved she could play more than everyone's favorite angel with this one, but unlike her \"Burning Bed\" character, has a bit of a mean streak. Russo is good as the Rapist, as well as Alfre Woodard as the roomate who tries to convince Marjorie she is going too far. Scarwid provides much needed laughs with her stolen \"Mommie Dearest\" performance as the flaked out roommate."
