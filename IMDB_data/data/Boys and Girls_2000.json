        "reviewBody": "The title above says everything about this movie: it's a `When Harry Met Sally' modern version with a inversion of characters. I realized that even before watch. The trailer line were very familiar: `First they hate each other, then they become friends and then...' \n\nAlthough it has some differences the premise is the same. Jennifer met Ryan during a trip and they hated each other. Years later they met again and another few years later they became friends. They had the perfect relationship till something happen and change everything. A very familiar story that was wonderfully adapted to a teenage movie. `When Harry met Sally' begins when they both graduate from High School, this one ends after the graduation.\n\nI love remakes, specially if it's a great movie, but the new version has to have something special,. Roger Kumble made an excellent job with `Cruel Intentions' for example, `Boys and Girls' is charmed, sweet and has great lines. Everything a romantic comedy must have.\n\nClaire Forlani is very talented and surprised me with her performance, Freddie Prinze Jr. is very cute and the girls just love him. As to the rest of the cast, they are in charge of the fun, specially Jason Biggs with his hilarious character. Go see it, it's worthy."
