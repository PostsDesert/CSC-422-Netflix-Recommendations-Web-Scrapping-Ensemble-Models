        "reviewBody": "This film is one which really makes us sit back and evaluate our lives and our relationships with those we love.\n\nMichael Keaton turns in a superb performance as the career man who is struck down by terminal cancer while his wife is expecting their first child.\n\nThe film then charts his efforts to make a video tape, for his unborn child, of his life and then discovers that it is not what it should be. With the help of a spiritual healer (Haing S. Ngor) and his wife (Nicole Kidman) he sets about trying to set things right with his family and his life.\n\nAlthough the ending at the after life is a little bit dreamy after the reality of the film, this is still a superb piece of movie making with winning performances from all the cast and a wonderful script.\n\nDefinitely not a film to relax to of an evening, it is one of those films, like Philadelphia, that should be watched every now and again just to remind us that life is too short for arguments and should be cherished.",
