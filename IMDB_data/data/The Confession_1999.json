I'd heard nothing about this film and saw it quite by accident.\n\nMovies like \"The Confession\"--that is, movies with moral dilemmas at their center (\"It's not hard to do the right thing; it's hard to know what the right thing is\" is the central dilemma of the film)--often bypass the ambiguities of complex moral questions in favor of a single answer everyone can love.\n\nIn this film there are moral ambiguities aplenty, and the film deals honestly with the difficulty of facing those ambiguities head-on and taking a clear position. Alec Baldwin's performance was startling and complex--a beautiful thing to watch. The supporting cast, including Amy Irving, was top-notch, too.",
