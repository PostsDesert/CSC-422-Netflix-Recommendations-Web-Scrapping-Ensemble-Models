        "reviewBody": "Many people are understandably afraid to watch foreign comedies in fear that they will miss the humor, that the subtle cultural aspects that develop a comedy will be lost on them. But one doesn't have to worry about such a thing with the Chinese Feast because it's style transcends cultural boundaries. Okay, i'll put it simply, it's funny, and it's fun, and in a way anyone can understand. I walked away feeling good, feeling happy, and not feeling like i had been treated to a cheese feast like some light comedies. I have seen other examples of comedy from the Asian countries, and maybe i just didn't get the subtle cultural jokes along with the others, but i saw the comedy was very accessible beyond national boundaries. I was also surprised to see a comedy from Tsui Hark after being introduced to him through his much more tragic and pessimistic Green Snake. As for Hark, he gives a fluid and lyrical direction along with a sense of timing which helps make this movie. And if you don't care about any of this, at least watch it for the very attractive Leslie Chueng."
