And I must say that I am the perfect audience for this type of series. I love comedy, romance, family, drama and girly type of shows, and most importantly, I like series that last. I had no expectations except for a few characters I was hoping to see again. It worked for me, I laughed, I cried and I enjoyed every second. It was like putting in old slippers, everything was the same, just a little older! The only negative thing was that it was only 6 hours ... I loved meeting my Gilmore Girls again, Amy and her husband stayed true to the original series. It was, for me, a perfect continuity and I was delighted with each of the four episodes.",
