Felt cut outs on a black screen.. \n\nThe Grandmother There is too much stress in this silent film. The actors wear white makeup, and the father acts like a Nazi, abusing his son. In fear, the son lays on his bed, and he plants a bed tree that amazes viewers. Only grandmother shows love to the boy, when she is only shown smiling and giving the boy kisses. The stop motion felt illustrations of the boy screaming blood were good. The movie was inspiring.\n\nThe Amputee, Version 1 and Version 2 This Tape of a woman griping who doesn't have a leg to stand on p, after saying all the negative things she has on her mind, is really a great work of art. However, it is bad that Version one and Version two are both included, because it makes the movie seem redundant. Lots of people walked out after that, and I was among them.\n\nPremonitions Following An Evil Deed\n\nI Touch A Red Man Button",
