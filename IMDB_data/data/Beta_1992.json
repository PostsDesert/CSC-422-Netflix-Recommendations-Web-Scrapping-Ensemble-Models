Beta however is heads and shoulders above other movies of it's kind thanks to the cast.\n\nAruna Irani deserves a very special mention, she was superb in a negative role and in my opinion this is her best performance. Madhuri is also tremendous, the scenes between her and Aruna Irani are electric. Anil Kapoor does well too in the male lead but in my opinion he is overshadowed by the two women. Among the supporting actors the late Lakmikant Berde deserves a special mention as he is hilarious in this movie whilst Anupum Kher does well in a negative role. \n\nThe songs are simply excellent, particularly Dhak dhak karne laga and Koyal se teri boli.\n\nYes the ending is a tad bit too melodramatic and unrealistic but that's what the audiences went for at the time. \n\nIndra Kumar has made some pretty enjoyable movies like Dil, Ishq, Mann and Masti but Beta is without a doubt my favourite from him\n\nHe did very recently try to make another melodrama Super Naani but the movie was a total washout. I seriously believe that these days nobody would go for movies like Beta, they were most definitely a product of their time in the nicest way possible. \n\nI revisited it only a few days ago after having not seen it in at least two decades and it was just as good as I remembered. \n\nSo on a closing note I would just like to say that Beta is without a doubt one of the best Anil Kapoor- Madhuri collaborations.",
