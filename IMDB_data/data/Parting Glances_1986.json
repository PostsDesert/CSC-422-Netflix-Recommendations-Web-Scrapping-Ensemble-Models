        "reviewBody": "An early gay movie that deals with AIDS on a first-hand basis, the film is delightful because it doesn't water down (or fetishize) the gay characters for a straight audience. Steve Buscemi gives a wacky, youthful performance as the character with the disease, and chronichles his relationship with his ex-boyfriend and his new partner. It's a slight but pretty enjoyable little movie, probably worth seeing for any Buscemi fan. 7/10",
