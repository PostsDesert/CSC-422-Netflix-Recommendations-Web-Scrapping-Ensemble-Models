The film is so well executed, I saw it in Oz last summer and have wanted to see it again and again. The actors are superb and use the melancholy and twists to such a creative height that you are entirely sucked into an amazing story. The war scenes are filmed in such a way that it has a most definite 'age' created orientated period. Very very realistic but moving scenes associated with such an awful ordeal which the troops, friends and family had to endure. Many things like this must have happened during the First World War and this film has en-captured a spirit that must have been obvious within the forces in a delicate and sensuous way. An absolute triumph!",
