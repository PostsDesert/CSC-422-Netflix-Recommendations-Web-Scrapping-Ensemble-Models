        "reviewBody": "When the Canyon High School reopens under the administration of Mr. and Mrs. Walker, the students recall Devon Anderson (Reza Bahador), a boy that killed his parents and vanished. On the first day of class, there is double homicide and Symphony (Karan Ashley), her boyfriend Craig (Jonathan Cruz) and her friends Josh (Johnny Yong Bosch) and Genesis (Kristy Vaughn) believe that Bloody Devon is back, but the police believe in a copycat. The sensationalist reporter Miller also attributes the murder to Devon. But Devon is really back with his baseball golf and he wants to play killing people.\n\n\"Devon's Ghost: Legend of the Bloody Boy\" is awfully ridiculous, actually the \"perfect\" bad movie since everything is terrible. I usually like low-budget and independent movies, but this flick is among the worse ones I have ever seen. The title refers to a ghost, but there is no ghost in the story. The silly and uninteresting screenplay is flawed, with the most unreasonable situations, terrible lines, using clichés and characters that stumble and cry instead of running away or defend themselves. The direction is poor and the acting is weak, but most of the actors and actresses are young and will certainly have chance to improve their performances in another film. The cinematography and lighting are cheesy. My vote is one (awful).\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Caçada Sangrenta\" (\"Bloody Hunting\")",
