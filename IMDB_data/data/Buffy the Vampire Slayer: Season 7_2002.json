        "reviewBody": "I loved the movie. I never watched the show. Then I get to be a voice in this thing.\n\nSo here's my review. Awesome series. The extension of the media into Motion Comic, wasn't, I'd offer, the idea of Joss Wheadon. But, as forces of nature go, at least the thing was made. \n\nWhen I was a kid, there was a show that used to have a narrator reading through a comic book while a camera panned from frame to frame. I OWNED these comic books, and LOVED this show. So as the field of motion comics comes into its own, it really was an honor to be part of this production, while also LOVING the product itself. \n\nWhat a terrific team. I know the dream is that it would have been an 8th and final season, but ya know, firefly should have gotten more than one season too. \n\nIf you are a die-hard fan of Buffy.. you'll love this. If you don't... tha's cool. We're all entitled to opinions, yours would just be wrong. :)",
