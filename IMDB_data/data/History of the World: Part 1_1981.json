        "reviewBody": "Marred only by overlength, this is one hilarious bit of cinema as Mel Brooks satirizes the stone age, the 10 Commandments, Rome, the Last Supper, the Inquisition, and Louie the 16th (sorry I couldn't get the name right). Of course, the stone age also happens to make fun of \"2001 A Space Odyssey\". Also funny is at the end with the whole \"Jews In Space\" bit. I love that stuff.\n\nPersonally I thought the best bits were set in Rome, what with the gags about Vestal Virgins, innuendo between the queen and the late Gregory Hines, the \"Stand Up Philosopher\", Ethiopia, getting the Roman guards high, and of course, the Last Supper. This is not to say the Inquisition Musical number is not worth a look.\n\n\"Jesus!\" - Mel Brooks\n\n\"What?\" - Jesus Christ"
