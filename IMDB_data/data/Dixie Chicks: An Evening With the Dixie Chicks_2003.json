I have no idea what he was watching but this is as good a concert as most. If you like these women you will like this concert disc. The 5.1 audio rocked my speakers and I'd liked to have seen them live. The back-up band is quite good too. This disc had me dancing around the room. Whether anyone wants to look at the Dixie Chicks political comments as right, wrong, poorly timed, or misplaced being said on foreign soil, it is hard to not see 10 years after the hypocrisy how the Dixie Chicks came through it smiling and singing."
