I bought the DVD (had to order it because nobody carries it) and still find it pretty entertaining.\n\nBenny Silman (played exceptionally well by David Krumoltz) takes up book making in college and gets more than he asked for. He ends up in a basketball points shaving scheme at Arizona State University that makes him rich. Yeah, the money is easy but greed soon turns the tables on Benny and his less than reputable business partners. The film has a good message, is relatively clean and has great script and actors. It does, however, leave you wanting a little more since it IS made for T.V. Still, I'm happy to own it and I watch it at the start of every college basketball season and maybe a couple of other times throughout the year.\n\nI kind of hope they don't remake it as it would probably fall victim to overproduction, which seems to be the theme in Hollywood these days.",
