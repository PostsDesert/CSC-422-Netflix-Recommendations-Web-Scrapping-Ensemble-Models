The gutter press in the UK are just shameless and try to validate their behaviour as reporting news, but are reprehensible. The language used in the tabloid press is nothing but inflammatory and George was hounded by them relentlessly. We know that they have since been reigned in after the phone tapping scandals, and rightly so. But the fact they were allowed to do and print such hateful stories is unacceptable. And watching them on film, talking in such an offhanded way about their stories and tactics is sickening.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone that has any doubt that there is still homophobia in the modern press.",
