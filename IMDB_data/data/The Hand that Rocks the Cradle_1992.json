I admit it is extremely similar to \"Fatal Attraction\" but I like this movie better. This time it seems Peyton is a little more evil than Alex and she has a better motive. Peyton is a nanny, she is to take care of Emily and Joe, she has different plans in mind. The acting is pretty good, the characters are well developed and it is a nice, cozy little horror you care rely on when nothing is on TV. I have to say in a way, it reminds me of \"Rosemary's Baby\". This time though, it is the one who rocks the cradle that is corrupt."
