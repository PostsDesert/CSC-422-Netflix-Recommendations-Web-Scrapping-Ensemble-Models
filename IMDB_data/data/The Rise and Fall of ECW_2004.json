This disc didn&apos;t prove ECW justice though, as nothing short of being there during it&apos;s prime would, but it comes damn near close!! It includes about 90% of the greatest moments in ECW history, but including every moment is an endless, impossible task. If you happen to come across it in stores, don&apos;t pass up the opportunity to purchase this excellent, historic DVD. In my eyes, this was the greatest wrestling DVD I have ever bought/watched, and my collection (1985-Present) is well into the hundreds!!! This has to be a must for any wrestling fan, past or present, young or even old. It&apos;s just that damn good!!!\"},\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating",
