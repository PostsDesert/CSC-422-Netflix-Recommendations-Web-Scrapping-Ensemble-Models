        "reviewBody": "\"An Everlasting Piece\" is a lively, smart little comedy which tells of two barbers in 1980's Belfast, one Prot and the other Catholoic, who start a toupee business and struggle to succeed against the adversity of a divided Ireland, commercial competition, and their own religious/political alignments. \"AEP\" is solid throughout with fresh faces, a good musical score, a clever and spunky story, lots of wry Irish wit and a few poignant moments too. Not your usual slappy-sticky comedy fare, \"AEP\" will appeal most to those who appreciate wry comedic subtleties. If you don't love the Irish, find another movie.",
