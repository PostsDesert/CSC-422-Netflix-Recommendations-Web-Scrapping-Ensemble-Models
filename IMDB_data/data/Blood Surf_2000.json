        "reviewBody": "I love monster movies. As long as they aren't boring I can always have some fun with them. This film is not boring. It has beautiful women, a recklessly brave heroine, the ocean, surfing, sharks, lots of \"croc fodder\", explosions.. it works! Of course it is flawed in many and humorous ways. Much of the acting, and most of the directing leave one aghast. But a real monster film fan will find something to enjoy. I enjoyed Kate Fischer immensely; even her acting,which was compelling. I enjoyed the action, and the crocodile chasing everyone around on land and sea. Some of the special effects were actually thrilling. The surfing scene is certainly worth seeing. \n\nYes, I knew everything that was going to happen before it did. I knew who was going to get eaten, and approximately when. But it still intrigued me enough to keep me watching. And that's all a monster film has to do. I might even want to get a video of it. Did I say that?"
