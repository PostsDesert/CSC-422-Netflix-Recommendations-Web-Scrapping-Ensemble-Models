Of course Beth slowly gets closer to Gale then a parole officer really should. This makes Joe, her boyfriend mad and in my opinion, rightfully so. I liked this film a tad more then I thought i would going into it. Perhaps the abundant display of the stunningly beautiful Everhart's mammeries had to do with my appreciation of the film. Because I sure know the stupid, stupid ending plot twist didn't.\n\nWhere i saw it: Showtime-on-demand\n\nMy Thriller Grade: C+\n\nin ADDITION to this watch: \"Jade\""
