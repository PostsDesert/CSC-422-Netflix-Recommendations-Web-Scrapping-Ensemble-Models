If it had been interesting we might of paid attention. This movie made me feel dumb from watching it. I have never been so happy for a movie to end. The acting was good the script was DUMB. Barry Watson walks into closets and ends up in different places and this seemed to confuse everyone in the theater. After that people started leaving....I didn't because my date spent $7 on my ticket. This movie has no purpose characters are tossed in and discarded randomly. If you REALLY must see this movie make sure you see it for free.....This movie wasn't even scary no one really jumped in surprise but many did laugh in spite. Please heed my warning....there's no point in explain the plot..there was barely a plot this movie made my head hurt!!"
