        "reviewBody": "Firstly let me \"come clean\" admit that I was in the film, as an extra.\n\nThat being said the film itself is a good story, well told on a very small budget. This of course somewhat effects the look and feel of the movie but in my opinion does not detract from the story or acting.\n\nAnne-Marie Frigon simply steals the screen whenever she appears. She gets the best \"one liners\" and makes the most of them. Other actors, including Sherry Thurig, do not have extensive experience in front of a camera but it doesn't stop them from giving good performances.\n\nThe attempt at a creepy atmosphere is evident and with some allowance for the lack of computer aided and expensive special effects we have become used to, the movie pulls it off.\n\nWatching it being made I came to appreciate the talents of all involved and look forward to more work from this collection of mostly local talent."
