I think it is one of the best \"worst\" movies out there. I've never found it again, and will cry the day my tape finally gives out. I just dug it out the other day and am gearing up for another viewing. So cracked in its layers. The Hillbilly nightmares...the running gag with the doctor...the poor puppies...the men with the torches...the gypsy...It's all flooding my memory, and I'm giggling all over again. If you ever have a chance to get your hands on this rare movie, DO IT! You won't regret a single penny of it.",
