        "reviewBody": "In Crazy Beautiful Kirsten Dunst (Interview With A Vampire, Bring It On) plays Nicole a rich girl at high school who befriends a first generation Mexican lad called Carlos (Jay Hernandez).\t\n\n Nicole and Carlos hit it off in spite of Carlos's reservations about the wild (crazy/beautiful) Nicole. He's from a poor family and keen to do well at his studies. She's on a path of self destruction, at least academically, probably physically. Carlos hopes to go to the navy academy and become a pilot. \n\n\tNow this sounds fairly ho hum but is brought successfully to the screen by very strong acting performances from both Dunst and Hernandez and also by Bruce Davison who plays Nicole's Dad Tom. \n\n\tThese characters are flawed and therefore interesting. The film is mindful of how complicated real people are. \n\n\tNicole is a carouser, drunk or stoned most of the time. Jay is level headed but becomes overwhelmed by Nicole. Dad certainly doesn't think he has all of the answers.\n\n\tCrazy/Beautiful is inspired a little by the inter racial aspect of the relationship but much more by the veracity of the performances.\n\n 4 Crazy Flys Out Of Five"
