I have to say that I still love it as much now than I did when it was originally on 15-20 years ago. Its about the lives of three young men (Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry & David Schwimmer) and three young women (Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox & Lisa Kidrow) that are all best friends and follows their lives in New York City. It's just one of those all-time great sitcoms that is just as funny watching reruns as it was watching for the first time! Not many shows are just as funny today as they were 15-20 years ago but Friends is absolutely one of those shows! All 6 characters are almost equally as funny! This truly is one of the best comedies that has ever been made!",
