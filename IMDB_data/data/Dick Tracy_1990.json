        "reviewBody": "Dick Tracy (1990) \n\n** 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nAt times brilliant, at times downright boring, Warren Beatty's adaption of the Chester Gould comic strip is a very frustrating film that has so much going for it but the end result really doesn't reflect that. In the film Beatty plays Tracy, the detective trying to bring crime to an end but without any witnesses he finds himself fighting an uphill battle. The main goal is to bring down Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) but without the testimony of Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) there's not much Tracy can do. DICK TRACY is such a beautiful film to look at that it's a real shame the final product isn't better. If the story and pacing had been better this here really could have been one of the greatest comic adaptation but as it stands the film is simply too painful to sit through to fully enjoy. I use the word painful on purpose because even though this things runs just 101-minutes it really does feel twice as long as ROOTS. I'm really not sure what happened and why the film turned out this way but Beatty certainly must get some of the blame with the lack of any real characters and the fact that everything happens at such a slow pace you just wonder what was the point. None of the characters are really all that memorable in regards to their actions but their looks are terrific. The special make up effects are one major asset and it certainly brings these characters to life, their ugliness and all. Even the Tracy character isn't all that deep for some reason. With that said, the technical side of this picture is downright flawless. The art direction, set design and cinematography are among the greatest you're ever going to see. The beautiful colors are some of the greatest you're going to see. I'd also say that the performances are extremely good and that includes Beatty in the lead role and Madonna as the sex symbol. Pacino screams his lungs out but manages to be fun and Charlie Korsmo is good as Tracy's little buddy. The supporting cast includes big names such as Dustin Hoffman, William Forsythe, James Caan, Charles Durning, Paul Sorvino, Kathy Bates, Dick Van Dyke, Henry Silva and Catharine O'Hara. Beatty's BONNIE AND CYLDE co-stars Michael J. Pollard and Estelle Parsons even show up. DICK TRACY is a beautiful film to look at but sadly it's mainly all style and very little substance."
