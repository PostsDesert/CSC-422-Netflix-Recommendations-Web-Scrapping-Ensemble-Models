        "reviewBody": "this film is not only chalk full of incredible camera angles and interviews with todays \"real\" athletes. it states that the reason many people get into this kind of sports is to be different from all the basketball, baaaaseball players etc. and they are a little messed up to want to do these things like jump 20ft high on a bicycle and speed down a hill 2 inches from the ground at about 85 mph. if you dont understand anything about these sports and would like to know more tis is the best thing to do short of talking to an athlete, even someone local whose been riding for years can tell you these things. watch this movie again and again to get the mentallity this people have. its short but it makes up for it"
