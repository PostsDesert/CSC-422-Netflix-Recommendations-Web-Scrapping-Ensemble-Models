        "reviewBody": "Alright, so 'Father Hood' is not the perfect movie. There have been many of its kind. It isn't devoid of plot holes and is predictable. However, it's also an entertaining road movie about an ex-con, Jack, on the run with his kids (Sabrina Lloyd) who were treated harshly (their hands were cuffed and they were abused) in a detention center). The only person on their side is feisty journalist Kathleen Mercer (Halle Berry) who tries to convince Jack to give her an interview (providing information against the youth detention center) and she'll work out a deal for him so that his sentence is reduced. Jack also drops by his mother's (Diane Ladd) in Las Vegas.\n\nOkay, so it's not anything new but that doesn't mean it can't be fun. Shot in a typical early 90's style, Darrell Roodt catches the cross country landscape effectively. The performances are good too. The late Patrick Swayze is brilliant as the reluctant dad. Sabrina Lloyd is cute and vivacious. Brian Bonsall can be annoying at times (but then again his character was a clich√©). Halle Berry is charming in her limited screen time.\n\n'Father Hood' holds some nostalgic value for me and it was nice to go back to memory lane for a while. The way to enjoy this one it to take it for what it is."
