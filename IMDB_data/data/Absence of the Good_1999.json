However, no acting awards are expected for anyone here, and the musical score was nothing special. Also, I appreciated how the storyline made one think and stay focussed to keep track of how the criminal investigation proceeded. I actually felt like I was following around these detectives on the case and able to understand their thought processes as more clues were obtained. 7 out of 10.",
