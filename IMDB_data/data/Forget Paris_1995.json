        "reviewBody": "Forget Paris is admittedly a film carried almost entirely by Billy Crystal, but with such witty delivery, he's perfect. Having said that, the whole cast look to be having a ball and it really comes across on-screen. Rose-tinted views of Paris, alongside near slapstick sketches in the States, makes for a fast-paced tale that you can just sit back and enjoy.\n\nMickey (Crystal) travels to France to bury his father, only to find that the airline has accidentally sent the body to the wrong airport. Ellen (Winger) is the airline official sent to assure Mickey that everything possible is being done. Despite meeting under such an awkward situation, soon enough they are walking the streets of Paris together and romance blossoms. But with lives on different sides of the Atlantic, there are going to be a lot sacrifices...\n\nAnd if the movie ever begins to feel as though it might be getting bogged down in the romance, it steps out to the \"present day\" restaurant scene where friends are sharing the story, each telling a different part and eager to find out what happened in the end.\n\nAn entertaining, funny and above all, charming story.",
