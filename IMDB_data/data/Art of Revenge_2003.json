Stephan Jenkins, (lead singer/songwriter for the band Third Eye Blind) is not the best actor, but he admits it, and he actually he did a better job acting as the movie progressed. He did a good job for his first time acting. And come on ladies... you have to see this movie because of the fact Stephan Jenkins is a babe! Woa! So overall it was a good movie, kept your attention, it's an independent film and I enjoyed it! I recommend it to the viewing audience.",
