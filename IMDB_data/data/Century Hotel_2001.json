        "reviewBody": "A young woman (Lindy Booth) lodges in the room 720 of the Century Hotel and the old bellboy tells that that room has several stories. Along the years, an old man marries a young virgin; a whore and her client fall in love with each other; a man is left by his wife and seeks her out in the hotel; a musician and the chambermaid has a weird relationship; two friends from navy have a gay relationship; a Chinese woman comes to America to get married with a powerful Chinese. Some of the relationships have good ending, others have tragic conclusion. \n\n\"Century Hotel\" is a movie with a good storyline of romances along many decades in a hotel room. However, the screenplay is boring with too long and fragmented with entwined segments. The most attractive plot is certainly the love story of a prostitute performed by the gorgeous Mia Kirshner and her client. Unfortunately the movie does not work well. My vote is five.\n\nTitle (Brazil): Not Available",
