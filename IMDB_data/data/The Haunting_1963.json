I was a full grown woman. For Pete's sake, I have watched almost every monster movie made. Even the original \"Wolfman.\" Hummm, I could handle this. \n\nWrong! I have never been so frightened in my life. Who or What was holding her hand??... \n\nThe door at the top of the spiral stair almost gave me a stroke. \n\nThis movie made a believer out of me. The sound effects, the lighting, the \"breathing door\", plus the fact it was Black and White.. The house, well don't ask me to attend a dinner party there. You will be eating alone. \n\nPerfect movie for Halloween.\n\nI give this movie a \"10\", The \"remake\" ?? Was that from the same book?\n\nNuff Said.",
