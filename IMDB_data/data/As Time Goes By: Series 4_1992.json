        "reviewBody": "I don't understand why the one unfavorable comment concerning \"As Time Goes By\" is posted up front.\n\nThe series is a sweet comedy, and never imagines itself to be otherwise. The plot is very simple - two lovers struggle as they reunite after 30 years. The episodes follow them as they learn to live with and love each other again, colored by bittersweet regrets of the years they missed. The series touches nicely on the wish we all have to either fall in love, or rediscover love, without burdening us with heavy symbolism. The cast are all excellent in their ability to hold character throughout the series. There is just the right balance of silliness brought on by English character and temperament, and the seriousness that accompanies the search for love.\n\nThe dialog is crisp and entertaining, underplayed and natural, never going for the cheap laugh available in some of the situations created. If you are looking for an uplifting and entertaining experience without having to wade through maudlin sentimentality, you will like this program."
