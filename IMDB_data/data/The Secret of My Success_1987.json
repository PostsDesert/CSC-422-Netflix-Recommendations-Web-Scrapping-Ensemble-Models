        "reviewBody": "Michael J. Fox plays Brantley Foster, a well educated boy from Kansas who leaves to New York to find success.He has difficulties at first, but then he goes to his uncle's, Howard Prescott's (Richard Jordan) owned multi-million-dollar company.He gives him a job.But he has to start from the bottom, from the company's mail room.He finds an other way to get to the top.He pretends to be an executive named Carlton Whitfield.That way he finds it easier to woo his dream girl, Christy Wills (Helen Slater).Herbert Ross' The Secret of My Succe$s (1987) is a pretty good comedy, not the best, but good.It's Michael J.Fox in the lead who saves a lot.His acting style appeals to me.Sure other actors do a good job in this movie too.Helen Slater is great as Brantley's love interest.There's enough chemistry between them to make it work.Richard Jordan makes a brilliant bad guy.Also his wife, Brantley's aunt Vera (not by blood) Margaret Whitton does a good job, you know, seducing Michael Fox and all.John Pankow, who was in Mad About You doing the role of Ira Buchman, is excellent in this movie as Fred Melrose from the mail room.Mercedes Ruehl makes a great visit as Sheila, the actor wanna-be waitress.I have seen many better and funnier comedies than this one, but this does work on some level.The movie is very 80's, so it may work for the nostalgia reasons.I, for instance, am a big fan of nostalgia.If it's not the nostalgia, it's the leading star of the movie.Michael J. Fox did add one extra star to my review.",
