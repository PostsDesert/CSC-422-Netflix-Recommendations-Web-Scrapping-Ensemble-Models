Arty camera work, odd angles etc. The problem is that all of the characters are so offensive that I couldn't give a damn if they lived or died. Once that feeling had set in all I wanted was for the film to end. Miss Geller is a decent actress, but if she doesn't find a good film soon may regret her decision to leave Buffy"
