        "reviewBody": "It's funny.....you get to middle-age....you have amassed a huge DVD collection, heavy on horror, particularly the 50's through the 80's, and you think you have seen all the \"A-list\" stuff. All you're trying to do now is round out the collection with obscure \"B\" and \"C\" list films....maybe some TV movies. Then, you see \"Tourist Trap\", and you think 'how did I miss this film?', which could easily be discussed in the same breath with Halloween, Nightmare on Elm St. and Creepshow.\n\nThis is a great, fun, scary movie. It helps that mannequins are naturally a bit creepy, being so life-like. I recall that excellent Twilight Zone episode with Anne Francis, with the mannequins moving in the department store. Tourist Trap has a big scare scene very early on, which could have been too much, too soon, but it really worked, and set the unnerving tone that the rest of the film continues. It made me realize how long it's been since I 'jumped' because of an unexpected scene in a scary movie.\n\nTanya Roberts was very good in this -- much better than she was as \"Sheena\" a few years later. The gore is not excessive for the sake of titillation, and the tension is unrelenting. The ghastly images of the mannequin mouths dropping so far open, and the screams coming out, will stay burned in my mind for a long time to come.",
