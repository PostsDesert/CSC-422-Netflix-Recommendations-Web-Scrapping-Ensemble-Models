I think it was the first i had everseen of her (2001) and after all i had heard about her acting as a \"blonde bombshell\" this picture sent me in another direction. SHE CAN ACT!! to see marilyn play a psychotic woman may not have been completely hard for her (no offense intended) but i feel it was superb acting! Ashame she wasnt offered more roles like this one"
