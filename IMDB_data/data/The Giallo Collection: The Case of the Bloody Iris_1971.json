        "reviewBody": "\"The Case Of The Bloody Iris\" is a movie filled with so many stupid and cheesy moments that it's impossible to list them all here (just an example: a bloody corpse is discovered in the elevator of a high-rise apartment building while the sun is still up; after several hours, the night has fallen, a woman tries to get into the elevator, and the corpse is still there, lying at the exact same spot - apparently none of the tenants cared enough to call the police). So I'll just mention the two things that bothered me the most: \n\n1) The dubbing is terrible. The actors who dubbed in the voices of the original cast sound so bored that you wonder if they even got paid for their work or it was simply forced upon them. There is barely ONE LINE that sounds right in this film. \n\n2) Edwige Fenech is gorgeous but ridiculously wooden as Jennifer. She wears the same \"scared\" expression throughout. A totally bland \"heroine\".\n\n The only highlight of the film is a bizarre mixed wrestling match between a tough stripper and one of her \"customers\". Now THAT is something you don't see every day! (**)",
