        "reviewBody": "As I sat down, I wasn't expecting much even with the constant praise I read about this particular Norris effort. So to my surprise, I usually can't help but grin, or chuckle whenever watching one his films (humorous or not), but \"Code of Silence\" altered that perception. Well just say up until that waterlogged, lonesome gung-ho final curtain call into heroic pulp territory. Now then I couldn't help but raise a smirk, and go along with the fantasy. What really pushes this one along; is that it's professionally directed with balls and vigorous energy by Andrew Davis. The well-plotted material keeps you involved, while even following the standard textbook cop drama elements. The honest script has some cringe moments, but never becomes brainless. Just look at the witty humour and turmoil drama (a real concentration on loyalty from the cops to the criminals) that's thrown in, it fits along with everything that opens up in the meaty plot.\n\nSo it begs the question. How was our star? Norris's competently does a fine job. His easy-going nature, brought to the screen a comfortable performance, even when he wasn't kicking ass. And we know how good he's at the latter, but his acting turn here had a rather genuine feel to his character. Even though he's one man antics cross the line. He doesn't need a partner. Hell, just sack the entire police force as you can see by the results. Norris is capable enough. He got game. Henry Silva's stoically vicious drug lord villain, was a sturdy show-in and Molly Hagan admirably delivers. Ralph Foody amuses as a burnt-out cop.\n\nNothing about this project is award winning material, but assured catering in nearly every field makes it better than just your average cop drama. A confidently good-looking production, is filled with well-placed set-pieces and sweaty stunk work infused by its snappy pace and an uncannily, upbeat music score. The urban setting is put to great-use and fashionably-captured shots. \n\nQuite an exciting and always on the move action yarn, which has a little more thought behind it than you might think.",
