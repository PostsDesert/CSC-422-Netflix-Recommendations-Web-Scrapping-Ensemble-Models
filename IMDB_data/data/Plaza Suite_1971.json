        "reviewBody": "This movie features Walter Matthau in three separate roles but the real stars are the women he performs with: Maureen Stapleton, Barbara Harris and Lee Grant. In each case, we see them in the roles of wife, girlfriend and mother. Maureen Stapleton's role was sad and the other two--Harris and Grant-- are comical. I found the roles of these women were more interesting and the acting more convincing than Walter Matthau. I am a fan of Walter Matthau but in this film he gives a lacklustre performance with limited material in the first story and overblown performances in the other two. Matthau is usually a very funny guy with great lines and superb delivery but the humour just isn't there and the lines fall flat. All three stories deal with marriage and relationships at various stages of life. The common thread is that they take place in the same suite at New York City's Plaza Hotel, a Neil Simon touch.",
