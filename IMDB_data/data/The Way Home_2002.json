        "reviewBody": "I tried this show because of Chyler Leigh and I stayed with it because of Chyler, she does not disappoint and her role as Producer is clearly helping this project. Sadie plays her role with a high level of earnestness that is a bit 'much' at times but still enjoyable.\n\nMy head canon is that Mama Del has some early dimension which accounts for some of the 'mystery' and her lack of truthfulness, plus why everyone puts up with her miserable attitude that flares up randomly.\n\nIt is also so so so great to see Marnie McPhail in something again.\n\nThey should not use the Patient Elliot storyline, though, that is an overused and sad trope that should be retired. Elliot she doesn't like you in that way, move on. Take the L, it's pathetic watching him mope around and interrupt awkwardly. Plus, where does he live? Is he living on the farm somewhere? Does he sleep over all the time or just come over for free coffee daily at dawn and no one says anything? Does he live in the barn? Does he have parents? Is he a ghost, is the twist? He needs more depth as a character to get me to 'buy in ' to this romance, at least Kat has chemistry with Brady and he has an actual personality (for better or worse).\n\nAlso, I need to hear people attempt a Maritimes accent. Someone, please, make an effort.",
