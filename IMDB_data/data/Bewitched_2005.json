Again the hype machine has triumphed, most of the funny is already in the preview, and thats about all I have to say. Will is OK, he gets to ad lib every so often (always comedic gold), but Nicole Kidman's performance is almost painful, she should maybe think about not signing on for the first movie she hears about as soon as she finishes one, maybe take a summer off (God knows she has a enough money to buy a moderately sized country).\n\nHopefully Mr. Ferrell doesn't disappoint in Wedding Crashers",
