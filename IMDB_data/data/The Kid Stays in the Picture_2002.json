        "reviewBody": "\"The Kid Stays in the Picture\" is a must-see for any person who's interested in movies and their making. This funny and exciting documentary tells the larger than life story of Robert Evans, \"discovered\" by Norma Shearer swimming in a hotel pool in 1956, who went to become a ham actor and soon afterwards, an extremely successful producer, who took Paramount studios from 9th to first in Hollywood in less than a decade. The man behind legendary films such as \"The Godfather\", \"Chinatown\", \"Harold and Maude\", \"Love Story\", \"Marathon Man\" and \"Rosemary's Baby\", Evans dated beautiful women (he was once married to \"Love Story\" star Ali MacGraw) and was obsessed with his goals (and he often succeeded, being responsible for some of the biggest hits of his time), what turned him Hollywood royalty and voted the world's most eligible bachelor. With one scandal involving his name, drugs and a murder, though, his career was ruined and he lost almost everything he had. But he came back, and \"The Kid Stays in the Picture\" explores his fascinating saga with the witty, cynical narration of Evans himself, never being too self-indulgent. Evans himself admits he was no angel. But then again, who is? Michael Moore's \"Bowling for Columbine\" deserved to win the Best Documentary Oscar back in 2002, but the absence of \"The Kid Stays in the Picture\" among the nominees is more outrageous than Evans' story itself. 9.5 out of 10."
