The mob, crazy romances, and outrageous revenge schemes! The cast is so wonderful and I give a thumbs up for Mr. Alan Alda's direction. I loved Madeline Kahn as always, Ally Sheedy was her sexiest, Molly Ringwald was great, and a special gratitude for Catherine O'Hara and Joe Pesci for making me roll of my seat laughing.\n\nIf your a fan of \"Father of the Bride 1 and 2\" or \"Runaway Bride,\" your sure going to enjoy \"Betsy's Wedding.\"\n\nSCANDAL. LUST. DISASTER. INTRIGUE. ...and the invitations haven't even gone out yet!\n\nEnjoy the show!"
