It's incredible how money can corrupt people to the point that it will make them do things that ultimately, they will live to regret. \n\nIt was a surprise to see this Australian film that only played a couple of weeks in New York. It's a much better picture than some of the very highly regarded ones that came out just about the same time and are still around, while this one went back to Australia, probably.\n\nThe director, Robert Connelly presents us with a story that's very plausible. In it, the greedy banker, played with fine assurance by Anthony LaPaglia, wants to be able to get rich with a scheme that is presented to him by the mysterious David Wenham.\n\nAside from some of the technical aspects of the financial world, it is very entertaining and very nicely acted by all the actors in it.",
