        "reviewBody": "Less known that Allen's \"Annie Hall\", \"Hannah and her Sisters\", \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\", and \"Manhattan\", \"Alice\" is a charming and delightful film that can be viewed as Allen's remake of \"Juliet of Spirits\" with some obvious themes from \"Alice in Wonderland\". Mia Farrow plays a wealthy New Yorker who one day feels that something is missing in her sheltered and comfortable life. She turns to a Chinese doctor whose magic herbs help her to reevaluate her life and her relationships with her husband, lover, mother, and sister. She may not find the answers for all the questions but she certainly learned a lot about herself. During the few days that film takes place, Alice experiences romance, finds spirituality, and even enjoys the power of invisibility. This film has one of the most optimistic endings in Woody's film. Mia Farrow is absolutely wonderful.",
