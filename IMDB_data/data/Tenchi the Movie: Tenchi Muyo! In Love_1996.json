        "reviewBody": "The three movies had a much different tone than the OAV series, with the first and third one being far more dramatic. Tenchi Muyo in Love is a really low-key, beautifully done production, which flows beautifully. The characters are incredible; they're what defined the OAVs, and they're just as great in this. This was my first introduction to the Tenchi Muyo universe, but you'd be better off if you watched either the OAV or TV series first (they both tell modified versions of the same basic story)"
