Jonathan Tucker's performance is awful and the guy who plays his best friend has a face that is more annoying than work on Sunday. The filmmakers did a good job in including everything I hate: 1) a guy who dresses up as a girl and has to deal with all the boys falling in love with him, 2) beautiful people that are supposed to be ugly, 3) pseudo-thoughtful & pseudo-intellectual speeches and 4) tons of boys/girls-cliches. Yak!"
