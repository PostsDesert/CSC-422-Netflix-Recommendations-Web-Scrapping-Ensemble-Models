It's personal and heartfelt without being tepid and pink.\n\nThe characters are very realistic and they make very fine, well balanced portraits. And it's a movie that can make you think a lot, if you want to - you can also choose just to hop on board and follow the flow of this journey.\n\nGreat ending! - I admit, I'm a weak sucker for an ending like that! :) This is a tenner! 10/10",
