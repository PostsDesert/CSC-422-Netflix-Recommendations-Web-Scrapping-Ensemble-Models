        "reviewBody": "This is a decent web series. It is a very king of off beat sense of humour going for it which some people will appreciate and others not. The show is about three guys who have a sketch comedy troop and they are discovered at their show by a big talent agent.\n\nThey celebrate their huge contract but then in a tragic accident one of them suffers a brain injury and the part of his brain responsible for comedy is damaged so the contract is in danger now. They try to hide it but the agent figures it out. They take him to the doctor who tells them he can fix it with a very expensive operation they can't afford. Basically the entire show is about them trying to help their friend get his sense of humour back.\n\nAll of the acting is great and there are some really funny scenes. There are also some less funny scenes but it is a short web series so it is definitely worth sitting through. If you like episode one you will like the rest but if you hate episode one you probably will hate the rest, like I said it is kind of a different sense of humour.",
