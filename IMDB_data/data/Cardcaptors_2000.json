It was just as bad as Sailor Moon.. (the new dubbed Sailor moon.. that's just...wrong). I just want to know how they could get \"Julien Star\" from \"Yukito Tsukishiro\" and \"Tori\" from \"Touya\"!? They changed way too much in this, from people's relationships in the series to names to bad voice dubbing to personalities.. *sigh* If they do this to Slayers like they say they will.. and change names in the series...and change the dub actors.. They'll answer to me.."
