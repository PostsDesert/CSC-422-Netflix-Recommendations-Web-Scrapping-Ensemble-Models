My thoughts were like many others: Where does MTV get off screwing around with once of the most beloved operas of all time?\n\nI did decide to watch it however, trying to keep an open mind. I was actually rather pleased by the performances and really taken with the style of filming. It didn't try to be something it's not (which I can really appreciate). It's edgy quality was sensitive enough to the original story that I found myself actually enjoying the production. Not being a fan of rap or hip hop in general, I was surprised by how much I was NOT offended. You can even hear small bits of Bizet's music weave in and out of the fabric. It had it's week moments, and was by no means a great movie, but it was unique, and I can appreciate that. I can also appreciate how this type of \"hip hopera\" may actually reach some people who would never think of watching traditional opera (just as I had never considered watching a rap artist sing over Bizet's melodies). I recommend this movie because of it's uniqueness and because it honestly wasn't all that bad!",
