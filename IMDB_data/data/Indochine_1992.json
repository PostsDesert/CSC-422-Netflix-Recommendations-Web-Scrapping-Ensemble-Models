Then again, I suppose this is the way of all colonists who invariably mistreat their 'possessions'..\n\nThe acting was terrific by all involved. Learning the pre-war background behind the extreme North/South polarizations and seeing all the strife that's touched Vietnam was the best lesson I've yet gleaned from any Vietnam movie.\n\nI think a cure has finally been developed for Oliver Stone.\n\nAs high a rating as possible."
