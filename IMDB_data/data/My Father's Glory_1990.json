        "reviewBody": "This beautiful, charming work (and its companion MY MOTHER'S CASTLE) is lifted from the memoirs of filmmaker/screenwriter Marcel Pagnol.\n\nIt is a loving, romanticized recreation of Pagnol's childhood trips to the south of France.\n\nDirector Yves Robert ices every scene with sweet affection and a seemingly effortless attention to detail.\n\nThere are so many moving, heart-tugging scenes.\n\nDescribing them all would spoil the confection.\n\nI'll mention one. Young Marcel accompanies his father, Joseph, a school teacher, to school one day. Not believing that Marcel can read already, Joseph writes a simple declaration of his love for Marcel on the blackboard. Marcel then surprises his father by reading out loud what his father wrote. It is such a touching, affecting scene.\n\nMY FATHER'S GLORY is bursting to the seams with such magic.\n\nVladimir Cosma's score perfectly captures the period and tone of Pagnol's memories.\n\nSimply exquisite.",
