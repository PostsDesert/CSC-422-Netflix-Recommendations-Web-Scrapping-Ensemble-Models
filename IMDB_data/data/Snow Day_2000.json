        "reviewBody": "Snow Day is such a great film. I could care less what people say, it is a classic Nickelodeon film that never gets old and 20 years later is still awesome.\n\nThe movie centers around the Brandston family, which consists of the father, Tom (Chevy Chase), the older son, Hal (Mark Webber), the daughter, Natalie (Zena Grey) the mother, Laura (Jean Smart), and the young son, Randy. Natalie really wants there to be a snow day, so she wishes for one and the next day, so much snow appears, which leads to schools closing down and a snow day being created. On this snow day, Natalie, along with her two friends, Wayne (Josh Peck) and Chet (Jade Yorker) try to stop a mean snowplow man named Roger (Chris Elliott) from plowing the streets so that they can have another snow day. Hal has a crush on the school's most popular and beautiful girl, Claire (Emmanuelle Chriqui), and tries to spend the whole snow day trying to tell her how he feels about her. Tom is a meteorologist that tries to compete against Chad (John Schneider) and steal the show as the better meteorologist. For Tom, Natalie, and Hal, anything can happen on a snow day for them.\n\nEverything about Snow Day is excellent. I love how it has 3 storylines, and I'd say the story with Hal and Claire is the best. It has a good love theme to it and turned out great by the end. The acting from everyone was great. Chris Elliott made a great villan for the film, Zena Grey, Mark Webber, and Chevy Chase were really good for the protagonists, Josh Peck did a pretty funny job as his character, and Emmanuelle Chriqui was really good as Webber's love interest. The comedy was pretty good and funny. Lots of great dialouge from all the characters and funny jokes were said. The pacing is pretty darn fast for an hour and 25 minutes, and makes the film to the point and not boring. I also love the song in the film from Hoku, Another Dumb Blonde. It's another thing that makes this film nostalgic and is a perfect song choice for the concept of Hal's storyline.\n\nOverall, Snow Day is a childhood favorite of mine,m. 20 years later, it holds very well and I could watch it over and over and never get tired of it."
