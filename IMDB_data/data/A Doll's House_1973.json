        "reviewBody": "With a feminist Nora, an icy Torvald, and a drunken Dr Rank, this adaptation perhaps tries too far to be a film version of the classic Ibsen play, setting scenes before and outside of the play (such as Nora's loan and Christina's past) rather than keeping strictly to the text.\n\nJane Fonda is a 1970s Nora, not as flighty as other actresses have played her, but still as determined in the final scenes. David Warner is an emotionless Torvald, which makes his awakening to the realities of his marriage hit home, while Trevor Howard is a less cultured Rank than Ralph Richardson in the other 1973 version of the play.\n\nWell-worth watching, and with beautiful settings deep in the Scandanavian snow, this 'Doll's House' is just as interesting as any filmed play, and sits well alongside the Claire Bloom/Anthony Hopkins version.",
