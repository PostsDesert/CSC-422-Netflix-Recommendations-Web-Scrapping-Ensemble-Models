        "reviewBody": "I'd never heard of this until a few weeks back. I saw it last week on video. What a lovely film. It treats its subject matter with real sensitivity. The performances are believable, especially by the two Polish brothers (who made the film as well)as Siamese twins who have shacked up in a hotel for reasons initially unknown, while Michele Hicks is really sweet as the only person who will befriend them. The mood and pace is slow and beautifully graceful. A nice change from shallow, dumb blockbusters, Twin Falls Idaho is a very touching, tender film."
