        "reviewBody": "How much you enjoy \"House of Flying Daggers\" may depend strongly on how familiar you are of martial arts films as well as how accepting you are of the clichés in the genre. Some things in the film are utterly ridiculous and if you are the type who thinks too much, then you'll probably not be so impressed. For example, the film has one of the more familiar silly themes in Asian films (both Chinese and Japanese)--the blind warrior who is able to defeat practically anyone. Sure, there is a twist to it in this film, but the idea of a blind person being a master with the sword is pretty nutty. Also, the daggers that fly in this film defy every possible law of physics. So, you just have to accept this or your head might explode. And finally, only in a martial arts film can anyone fight on after having a bazillion fatal injuries (see \"Throne of Blood\" to see the ultimate scene like this).\n\nThe story, however, is wonderful and provided you can let yourself just sit back and absorb it all, you are in for a treat. Rarely have I seen a more exquisitely filmed movie. The use of birch trees and bamboo is amazingly artistic--as are the Fall colors. Also, the musical score is lovely and works so very well with the visual aesthetics. As far as the swordplay, martial arts and the like, it's also amazing--and light-years ahead of the wonderful old Shaw Brothers spectacles (which were great for their time). Overall, a real treat--a film full of excitement, romance and artistry. Well worth your time.",
