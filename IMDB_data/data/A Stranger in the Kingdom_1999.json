By far Craven's darkest film to date, telling a story of murder and racism in a small 1950's Vermont town. A brilliantly executed piece of cinema which is at once both a compelling drama and a riveting whodunit, featuring top-drawer performances (particularly Rusty DeWees, Bill Raymond, and Ernie Hudson.), and an appropriately eerie score by the Horse Flies. Like all of Craven's films except for 'Rivers', it may be hard to find outside of Vermont, but well worth a rental if you do come across it.",
