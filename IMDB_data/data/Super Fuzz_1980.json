Even though it has been a while since I've seen Super Fuzz, I remember that it was a movie I was fond of and probably will always be fond of. It was about a police officer that acquired super powers by witnessing a nuclear explosion. Sure, it wasn't that original and it was a bit comic bookish, but that is not what made the movie. What made the movie is what he did with his new found super powers that he lost whenever he saw the color red. Oh this movie was hilarious. He did one silly thing after another with his powers all the while he annoyed the heck out of his partner. This was an excellent family movie that was just plain funny. The actors chosen for the main characters were a perfect fit and the story just flowed. I give Super Fuzz high marks, it is a must see.",
