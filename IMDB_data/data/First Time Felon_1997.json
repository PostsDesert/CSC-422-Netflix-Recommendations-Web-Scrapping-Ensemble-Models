        "reviewBody": "I am not one to cry, so it takes a powerful movie and powerful performance to pull some tears out of my eyes. This was the second time I saw the movie, and it was even more powerful than the first. Everything was perfectly balanced, so much was left unsaid in words, but got through in other ways. I have always been a big fan of Charles Dutton, and I am so impressed by his first role as a director. Omar Epps did a fantastic job, even when he is just alone in the screen, his face speaks volumes. I cannot think of a single thing I would change about this movie.\n\nThough it was a bleak picture of America, and especially black America, this movie gives us so much to hope for, and provides goals we can work towards. It sends a very very positive message to children, and I would recommend it for teenagers. I would recommend that a parent watch it with his children and then have a discussion afterward. I hope that everyone watches this movie.\n\nThough the movie has some sappy moments, I found that it was very fast paced. The timing was precise and fantastic and never interrupted the flow. Sit down and watch this movie with American Historey X and you will be in for a fantastic evening. In fact I recommend you sit down with you teenage son, watch both and then discuss.\n\nI hope this was helpful.",
