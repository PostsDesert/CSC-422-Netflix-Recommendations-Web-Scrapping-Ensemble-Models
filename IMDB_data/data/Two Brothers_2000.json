All parents should take their kids to watch such movies, it will make them love and care for animals. It also creates very important environmental awareness too. The director seems a great person to make both \"Two Brothers\" and \"The Bear\". Both movies are on animals and the tragedies they come across. And they both make humans empathetic of animals. The two Tiger cubs were great actors, and made us sad with their helplessness in some parts. It makes us realise how innocent animals are. Two thumbs up for this movie!!",
