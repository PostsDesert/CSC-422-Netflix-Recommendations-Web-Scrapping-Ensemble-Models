        "reviewBody": "I already had a base in the game when I bought this DVD (a $10 whim), so it did nothing for me. But if you come in knowing nothing, it's probably a good starting place. The concepts and strategies discussed are almost laughably basic. For one thing, order of play and betting options (check, bet, fold, etc) are reviewed on every street of every mock hand. It doesn't delve into tells at all, and wastes 20 minutes at the end giving various poker variants a two minute description. Basically, if you've played the game before, this video will not help you. It will only patronize you as Chris Moneymaker's ever-so-punchable face keeps looming. This one should only go to true poker \"dummies\"",
