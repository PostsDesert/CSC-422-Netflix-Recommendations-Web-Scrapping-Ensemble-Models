        "reviewBody": "holy crap this is a bad show. First and foremost I absolutely adore the US version of queer eye, but this doesn't even compare to it. All the people on the show are really unfunny and camp and the end result of the makeover never makes you go WOW like the US version. This show is bad because I find the Uk version of the fab five really annoying. . But the absolute worst thing about this show is that it has lost all the charm and wit which attracted me to the original. I love the US fab five with Carson making me crack into hysterics every second, Kyan melting me with his hot hotness, and the rest of the guys being fun, lovable and way more enjoyable to watch.\n\nTo conclude I will say, stop screwing us over Living TV by showing us this copied piece of B.S. Stick to the original and get rid of the English Queer eye for the straight guy.\n\nBy the way this is an unbiased comment since I'm English and not a homoephobe or anything."
