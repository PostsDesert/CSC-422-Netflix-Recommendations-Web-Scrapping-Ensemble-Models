Crystal is his usual likable self, but Muresan is the real find here. Sure, he could use some brushing up on his English, but Gheorghe has a natural gift for acting, it seems. Unfortunately, the movie is only sporadically funny, and the more emotional scenes seemed forced and just didn't work they way they should have. It's not bad, but the weak ending left me disappointed.",
