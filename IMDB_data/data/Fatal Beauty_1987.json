With an underrated cast and a vibe that just screams 80s buddy cop action flick, I immediately was hooked. Whoopi was entertaining in the lead role. Sam Elliot and Ruben Blades were witty. Brad Dourif...The man I grew up watching terrorizing people as a killer doll. He was one year shy here before he went on that multi film rampage which would earn him millions no doubt was great in his antagonist role. I'll def be watching this one again.",
