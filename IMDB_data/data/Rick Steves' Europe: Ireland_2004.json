Unlike most travel documentaries this one takes you more in-depth despite having a short runtime. He manages to squeeze in interesting facts and scenery in a quick but relaxing manner. You will experience landmarks, art, food, and local customs.\n\nThis show is a definitive must see for any travel enthusiast. You will definitely find a way to appreciate it especially in the later seasons.",
