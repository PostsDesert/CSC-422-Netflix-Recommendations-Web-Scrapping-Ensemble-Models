For example, take the scene where the two soldiers are playing with cups and a coin in a cell and fool their guard. It wouldn't be funny even in a comedy.\n\nIndeed an appalling movie. When I saw the ridiculous air explosions effects I thought the movie had been made in 1980s. But it was made in around 1999!"
