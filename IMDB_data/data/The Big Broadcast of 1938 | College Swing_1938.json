This is a great movie for black and white buffs.\n\nSome classic scenes in this movie:\n\nW. C. Fields in his best golf playing scenes ever.\n\nMartha Raye hugging and puffing with her big mouth against a sail to keep a life raft sailing toward a big ocean liner.\n\nKirsten Flagstad from the Metropolitan opera delivering a Wagner aria.\n\nBut the piece de resistance is Shirley and Bob singing what would later become Bob Hope's Theme song, \"Thanks for the Memory.\"\n\nAlthough not listed in the cast, I saw Lucille Ball, probably with the most lines of any of her thirties' movies.",
