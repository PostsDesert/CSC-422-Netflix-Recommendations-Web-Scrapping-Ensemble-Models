        "reviewBody": "Only put this on because I was curious to see what a teenage placenta looks like, but boy what an unexpected treat. Took me back to years ago when I loved to get drunk, then smoke a little salvia - just enough to feel the electricity flowing through my arms out of my fingertips and get a bad case of rhyming word garble. I'd wind up passing out drunk and have freaky dreams I could barely remember the next day. This gem is like one of those dreams was captured on film so I could enjoy it in sobriety. The level of detail is amazing. I kept pausing so I could look at all the stuff in the background. Could probably watch it twenty times and keep finding things I never noticed before. The camera work is fantastic. It's well written, the characters are thoughtfully fleshed out, and the acting matches the dialog. At first it reminded me of John Waters' early films, but overall the tone is much darker. This is not really a comedy, it's just so weird and sick you may laugh in discomfort. Possibly the most bizarre film I've ever seen that still manages to have a coherent plot. Will definitely have my eye out for future works by Joel Rabijns and Yves Sondermeier.",
