        "reviewBody": "Who knew or remembered that Jim Carrey could be dramatic? He offers a genuine deep performance as a troubled youth, bright, but a high school drop-out who is unbearably harassed by his holier than thou parents, especially a father who is a perfectionist in every sense of the word.\n\nIronically, the Carrey character soon takes a back seat to a brother, a closet homosexual, who breaks off with his fianc√©, and a married sister, ready to abort her pregnancy because the father always believes in being financially prepared before starting a family.\n\nJames Sikking and Bibi Besch are first rate as the parents out of the 1940s and 1950s who are living the 1990s as if that period never existed.\n\nThis is a very well done film worth watching.",
