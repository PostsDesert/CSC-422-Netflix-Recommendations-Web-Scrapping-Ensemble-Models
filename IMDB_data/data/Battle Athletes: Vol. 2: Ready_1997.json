On the other, Battle Athetes is a dark commentary about ruthless competition. The story switches between the cute and the scary with ease, which really adds to the series' charm. \n\nI thought the series was great. Video and audio quality is high. Subtitling work was excellent (I haven't seen the dub). The story unfolds at a slow but even pace. Fans of Ranma 1/2 (for example) might give this",
