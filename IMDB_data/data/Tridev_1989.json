But perhaps nowadays nobody will have the patience to go through it all.\n\nStory is about 3 frustrated young men fed up of the inefficient law system in the country and set out to bring justice on their own.\n\nThe good - Dialogues, catchy songs,action sequences, plot of the movie The bad - Weak background score (quite silly at times), jobless ladies.\n\nIt you are a fan of Sunny Deol, Jackie Shroff or Naseeruddin Shah, then watch this.",
