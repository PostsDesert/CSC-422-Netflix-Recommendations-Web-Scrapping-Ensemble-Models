        "reviewBody": "The Last Man on Earth was such an underrated comedy that was cancelled too early. I'm glad it was able to get 4 seasons in but it needed one more to finish the story off. It sucks when shows end on a cliffhanger. It's about a cataclysm that strikes earth wiping out the entire population except for Phil Miller (Will Forte). He travels the United States, Canada and Mexican borders searching for other survivors. He ends up finding some fellow survivor and end up finding it difficult to live with other people again. What follows is an absolutely hilarious show and as always a hilarious Will Forte, who leads a pretty good cast that includes January Jones, Jason Sudeikis, Kristen Schaal, among others that are very funny in this. Give it a chance!",

Now, in his RV, Phil searches the country for other survivors. He has traveled to every city, every town and every outpost in the United States, Mexico and Canada, and has found no one, which leads him to the painful realization that he is almost certainly the last living being on the face of the earth.
