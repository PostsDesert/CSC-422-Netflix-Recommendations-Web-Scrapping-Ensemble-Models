        "reviewBody": "Okay... maybe phenomenal isn't the word, but it's the first word that comes to mind.\n\nScream Bloody Murder is about a bunch of school girls, complete in school girl uniform, who, along with their female teacher and some guy with a broken leg who's driving them,are on their way to a dance at an all boys school. Each of the girls fills a stereotype- The goth, the *ahem* promiscuous one, the lesbian, the virgin, the smart one, and the mysterious new girl who joins their motley crue of cliches at the last minute. Their van breaks down, and a tow truck driver takes them to his shop, where the girls, when not making out with each other, start dying gruesome deaths.\n\n Now, you're probably thinking, \"Hey, this movie sounds terrible,\" and in a sense, you are correct. The film is anything but scary, but it wasn't made to frighten. Simply to entertain. If you're looking for a coherent plot, then stay away. If you're looking for cheesy effects and brilliant one liners, then definitely check this one out."
