Its strength isn't in horror. In addition to the fine scenery, Elke Sommer wears some sexy outfits. That's how it is with most of her movies. I don't watch them for plot or acting. I just want to stare at her and develop lewd fantasies. Interpret the movie like that and you're sure to have a great time watching it. Bava went on to cast Sommer in \"Lisa and the Devil\" (also called \"The House of Exorcism\"). Good times.",
