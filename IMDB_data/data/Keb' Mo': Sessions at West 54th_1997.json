        "reviewBody": "This is a small studio performance by Keb Mo' with a small band and guest pianist Dr. John. It's a pleasant, but unspectacular concert.\n\nThe popular blues singer delivers familiar songs of his and banters a bit with the small crowd assembled. There isn't a lot to say about this DVD, except if you've heard Mo's CDs, you've heard most of what's on this, with the exception that he interrupts a few songs with his banter. Normally, I don't like that sort of thing (songs being interrupted) but Mo' gets away with here because he's an entertaining talker as well as singer. Dr. John is very good in here, as good as I've ever heard him. I wish I could have heard more of him on this DVD. \n\nOverall, this is okay but it's more like a sound-enhanced CD (better heard than seen).",
