The concept is pretty good, but the way it was put together was not. The performances were poor all round, save for Cary Elwes who puts together a delightfully eccentric character in Albert Bodine. It's worth a watch just for Elwes' role. I'm still waiting for him to do something great - I believe he is capable. The plot was good. I enjoy murder mysteries, and this one had me thinking at one point it could be any one of them after seeming obvious at first. In the end, a bit unsatisfactory, but certainly not on the worst list. Not much more to say, but I have to fill 10 lines. What else? What's so special about Rachael Leigh Cook? In this movie: nothing. Watch Annabella Sciorri, though, for future star power."
