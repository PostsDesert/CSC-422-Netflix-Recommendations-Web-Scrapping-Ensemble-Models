        "reviewBody": "My wife and I didn't expect much from this film, knowing that it has the worst box office in the past ten years for a Chinese New Year release and how much we loathed \"The Touch\"... However, being a sucker for bad movies, I opted for the action movie rather than the other usual comedies and I wasn't disappointed at all. Yes, the dialogues might be a bit dodgy, a common flaw amongst Hong Kong production nowadays, trying to look \"Hollywood-esque\" but we were there for the action and we got what we were looking for, great fight sequence with each character having his/her own fighting style.\n\nI have seen most of Yeoh's movies and this one ranked right at the top with \"crouching tiger hidden dragon\". Most of her film roles were forgettable but \"silver hawk\" at least leaves a more lasting impression albeit Yeoh really begin to look her years. I certainly hope that a sequel would follow but judging from the box-office, I might be pushing too far.",
