        "reviewBody": "Linkin park has done some great things in the past. from music videos to music in general. but you haven't seen their true side - sometimes.\n\nThis concert took place during the 2003 sanitarium tour. linkin park was touring with Limp bizkit, metallica, the deftones, and mudvayne. and as it turned out, everyone had fun during the concert.\n\nbut here's a fair warning for all of you people with kids who like linkin park. there are numerous times chester says the F-word. of course, it's all censored, but at the end of the song \"a place for my head\", chester raises the middle finger and says \"what the F***? yeah!\" so keep out from that. they didn't censor him calling the audience number one with his finger.\n\noverall, linkin park is great, and i expect them to do great in the future.\n\n10/10",
