Who else can be as funny as Peter Sellers? (certainly Steve Martin won't be) Who else can deliver a line as smoothly as David Niven? (\"Saved only by the fact that I am INCREDIBLY well bred\") Who could be as twisted as Capote? (THE COW, THE COW! Use your god damn personal pronouns and prepositions!) And of course, Alec Guiness being gone makes such a role unplayable by anyone acting these days!!! Great actors, at the height of their skills, a great script, great direction, and Maggie Smith at her hottest (\"I want my Dickie! My husband.\") Too bad they can't make movies this good anymore...."
