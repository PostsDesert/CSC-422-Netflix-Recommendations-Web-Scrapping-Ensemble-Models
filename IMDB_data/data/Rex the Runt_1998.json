But after about 13 episodes at christmas is vanished from tv, i was upset about this and hope that another series would come, my prayers wer answered in september 2001 when a second series came on tv. It was as good as the first series.\n\nEach episode is different from the last and they are deeply funny.\n\nThe characters are:\n\nRex: The Dog Wendy: The sarcastic female dog, alos known as a bitch ;) Bob: The big fat jelly wobbly fat bast***....according to Wendy Vince: Their supposed pet who is always doing something, either bounching on screen, trying to kill himself or saying one-liners. e.g: Sausages or Fat Bast***.\n\nAs the 1st series went on each episode got better and better. As I write this the 2nd series is currently on. \n\nYou do not want to miss the chance for some quality viewing, you wont be dissapointed. But if you miss it, then its your fault and you may find that you wont see it on tv for a long time. (i waited nearly 3 years for the 2nd series)\n\n10/10\n\nIf you like this try:\n\nWallace and Gromit"
