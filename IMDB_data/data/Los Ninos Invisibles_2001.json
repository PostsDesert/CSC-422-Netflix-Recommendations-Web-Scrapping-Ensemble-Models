I personally found the film to be terribly boring. In 1950s Colombia, a small town is abuzz because (A)- a local girl has been selected to represent the state in the Miss Colombia Pageant for the first time and (B)- the first-ever television has arrived for them to watch it on. Against the backdrop, we watch the story of a chubby 12-year old boy who likes his next-door neighbor. Ho-hum. He steals a black magic manual that will supposedly cause him to become invisible upon performing a ritual in the cemetery with the gizzard of a stolen hen, the heart of a cat, and a scapulary (a kind of Catholic medallion). He then enlists the help of two friends. A boring coming-of-tale. 3/10",
