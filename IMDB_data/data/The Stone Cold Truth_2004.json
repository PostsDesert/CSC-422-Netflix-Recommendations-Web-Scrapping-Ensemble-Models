Okay, it is not bad, just not what I expected when I put it on. \n\nI liked that more of our beloved gang's members did more in this LBT sequel. Petrie learning about his uncle was the best in that aspect of the movie. There are also some good action scenes and scares. \n\nThe dialogue is also more mature in this one and I appreciate that. When they talk about \"the flying rock\" and what it could be, I actually found it engaging, because these mysterious and fairly weird creatures began talking about what is out there (but they could have made a better name than \"rainbow faces\"). They had a moment when they made my jaw drop. \n\nPteranno and his goons are actually really funny and well voiced (Pteranno beautifully by Michael York) and get some great lines and good development throughout the movie. \n\nThe only real disappointment in this movie is a bunch of forgettable songs. As a whole I do not like the musical aspect of the LBT sequels, but it kind of worked in LBT VI: THe Lone Dinosaur. \n\nA different take on these many sequels and worth showing to your kids (or watch it if you will give it a chance).",
