        "reviewBody": "The picture talks about a Vietnam veteran (Charles Bronson) attempting to begin a new life in honorable issues . He works as an upright watermelon farmer who helps other workers when are really harassed , but a mobster hit-man (Al Lettieri) and a local syndicate villain (Paul Koslo) are menacing his plans and the melons harvest . They go after him but Bronson'll execute his legitimate defense as well as extreme wrath and he'll become in judge , jury and executioner . Later on , the vendetta of the mob is turned onto Mr. Majestyk himself . The melon farmer only has acquaintance to a beautiful Mexican woman (Linda Crystal) to battle the organized crime .\n\nIn the film there is action , exciting car pursuits , shootouts , thrills , suspense and a little bit of violence . From the beginning to finish the noisy action-packed and fast-moving are continued and that's why it results to be entertaining . The great climax of the film is the final confrontation between the starring and the enemies that's stimulating and moving . The story is an adaptation from Elmore Leonard novel who also did the storyline . This is the only filmed adaptation of an Elmore Leonard crime novel that Charles Bronson ever appeared in . This film was premiered in the same year another Charles Bronson picture , the successful Death wish (1974) that created several sequels . \n\nCharles Bronson acting is wooden as being habitual in his roles as a merciless revenger . This picture represents one of a handful of films starring Charles Bronson that deal with Mexico and/or specifically Chicano characters , the pictures resulted to be : Breakout (1975) by Tom Gries , Borderline (1980) by Jerrold Freeman and this one Mr. Majestyk (1974) by Richard Fleischer . Nice support cast , such as : Linda Crystal , Paul Koslo and special mention for Al Lettier , his tremendous interpretation is terrific , as a nasty and nefarious mob killer , though with quite gesticulation , his appearance is the best part of the film . The pic was well directed by Richard Fleischer , it's narrated understanding as well as hardly . The flick will appeal to Charles Bronson fans .",
