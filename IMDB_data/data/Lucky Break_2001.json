Sure, it is improbable, but the actors are obviously having fun, making it such a pleasure to watch. Imagine a bunch of no-talent prisoners attempting a musical to \"please\" their warden (and escape)? Can they pull it off without killing themselves laughing at their ridiculousness? That's entirely debatable. The songs are catchy, the casting of the musical characters (think con-jobs) hilarious, the costumes.... well, see for yourself. This is one film we are planning to buy and keep. Just what is needed when stuck in lousy winter weather.",
