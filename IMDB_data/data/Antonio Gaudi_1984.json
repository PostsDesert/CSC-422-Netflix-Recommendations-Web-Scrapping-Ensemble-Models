I suppose Antonio Gaudi's style would be lumped into the category of \"whimsical\" by architectural scholars, but for a man to have had the imagination to design such magnificent buildings a century ago is to me a sign of sheer genius.\n\nUntil seeing TCM's airing of this film I'd only seen photos of the Cathedral of the Holy Family. The beautifully photographed walking tour through so many of his designs was a visual feast and the absence of speech was not only a blessing, but entirely appropriate. After all, what could one say that the images hadn't already said? I sat there dumbfounded and agape.",
