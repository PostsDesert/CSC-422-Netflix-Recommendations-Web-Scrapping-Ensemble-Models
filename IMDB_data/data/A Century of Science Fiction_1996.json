        "reviewBody": "This is one of the worst documentaries ever made. Most of the Sci-Fi films featured were B-Movie clips. Even when it showed clips of better films, the quality was bad. When Christopher Lee was talking, you could see cutout lines from the bluescreen. The animation was terrible. When I saw this, I thought it was Chistopher Lee's grandson's high school project, but no, it was an actual company. It said \"2 Hour Special\" on the DVD Cover when it really went only for 1 hr 40 - 45 min. It gave none or not enough information about Star Trek films, E.T., Close Encounters Of The Third Kind and the Star Wars films. I think some amateur film-makers could make a better documentary than this.",
