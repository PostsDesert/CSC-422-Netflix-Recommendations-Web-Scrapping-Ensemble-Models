        "name": "The Best-Looking and Sounding Concert On DVD",
        "reviewBody": "Two words describe this concert and DVD: \"THE BEST!\"\n\nOn tape here is the final night of the Roxy band's reunion concert in October of 2001 in London. This, like lead singer Bryan Ferry's 1989 Newton concert tape, is fabulous, featuring nothing but great songs, great musicians and great visuals. This concert is even better - in fact, the best concert DVD (or tape) I have ever watched, and I've seen maybe 50-75. I watched this 10 times in the first month I owned it. I've watched in now for several years and still think it's great.\n\nIn a nutshell, I have such a high opinion of this DVD because it combines great music with tremendous visuals. If there is a better job of filming an indoor concert, I'd like to see it. The editing, sharp picture, dazzling colors and fun performers/musicians and dancers are a real treat.\n\nThe concert features the Roxy Music band's regular performers for many years, meaning Ferry, guitarist Phil Manzanera saxophonist Andy MacKay, pianist Colin Good and drummer Paul Thompson. (Although the documentary said it had been almost 20 years since those guys were all together). Added to the mix are guitarist Chris Spedding, and two great- looking and extremely talented female musicians, Julia Thornton (percusssion and keyboards) and Lucy Wilkins (violin and keyboards). Thornton is stunning to look at it - a real knockout - and Wilkins is fun to watch with her dancing when she isn't playing an instrument. Also, a third female addition, Sarah Brown, is great on vocals and I'm sorry she didn't do her solo on \"Jealous Guy,\" as she did on the CD. Zev Katz provides solid bass play but is a low-key guy who stays in the background.\n\nIn addition to his singing, Ferry shows talent on keyboards, harmonica and whistling! Each musician is outstanding and given opportunities to show his or her talent. Manzanera has the most guitar work and solos but I loved Spedding's one featured solo on the best of all in the concert. \n\nThe steady beat, thanks in large part to Thompson's strength on drums, and mellow-ish music all make for a unique sound unlike any other I've ever heard. I don't think these guys were as good when they were young but they've honed talents and now excel in the instruments they play. They (the regulars) are all probably in their mid 50s. Combine that with the great camera-work and you have a concert on DVD that is hard to beat. If only they all were filmed this well!",
