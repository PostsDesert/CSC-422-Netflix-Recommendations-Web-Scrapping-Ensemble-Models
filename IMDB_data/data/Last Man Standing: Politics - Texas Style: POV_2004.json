        "reviewBody": "Story of a state congressional race in Texas 2002, Rick Green* (R) vs. Patrick Rose (D).\n\nThe story's characters are only mildly entertaining; Rick Green is the most interesting with Mr. Rose being kind of introverted at times. Rick Green is a hardcore Christian reassuring himself that either he wins his seat back or \"He (God) has another plan for (him).\" The story is woven in with a side story of the democratic ticket in Texas and the history of the Democratic Party in Texas. The side story of the race for the governorship and the senate seat is pretty bland and not worth watching. The narration is a tad to telling Â– bashing the audience in the head with some things that should be shown. The movie is only likable because of the subject matter.\n\nFor political people only - 7/10",
