        "reviewBody": "This show is completely and totally incredible. It's so much more than just a simple shoujo drama. It's shoujo, it's drama, but it's also got action (sword duels, and they're just...awesome), comedy (yes, the quintessential Cute-Animal-Mascot, but even he's a little...different), and a plot that actually forces you to think. Who is End-of-the-World? Who is Mikage? What is the \"power to revolutionize the world\"? Why does Utena want to be a prince if she's a girl? What is free will? These questions and so many more arise over the course of the show. Every character has a deep psychological flaw and their own personal set of motivations and unique (often tragic) past. This is not a show for the faint of heart -or- mind. While the show is never explicit, it does contain mild violence (come on, sword duels without violence would be an oxymoron--blood is never shed though) and implied (never graphic) sexual situations. Another issue that may stand in the way of some narrow-minded types' enjoyment is the fact that nearly every character in the show has a--oh, shall we say, *flexible* sexual orientation. Just know that if you can't handle the original non-butchered \"Sailor Moon\", you won't be able to handle this. The Utena dub, by the way, is excellent (with the exception of a few voices). Juri and Touga were given voices that fit their characters extremely well. All in all, I highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend this show."
