The other hour and 50 minutes, is silly, and boring. But it does have redeeming qualities, which makes it worth watching on late nite TV. Jack Nicholson is good in a very early role,(see what he was like before he started to take himself too seriously!) the girls were hot, hot, hot, and there is a great scene at the start, that shows Sonny Barger in his early days. But scenes of guys driving around in circles on their bikes, to the weirdest music I ever heard, shows that the director was a film school dropout!",
