        "reviewBody": "A bit of a lost classic that slipped between the cracks despite the Oscar nomination for lead actress Kim Stanley, this story of kidnapping and madness in the Savage household starts off with a first hour so expertly paced, nuanced and beautifully photographed that you begin to think the 8.4 score it has on IMDb isn't a stretch at all. The way Forbes handles the exposition, withhelding information from the audience long enough to keep them guessing, releasing them in an ambiguous fashion to maintain an aura of mystery, all the while not forgetting those little casual moments that don't advance the plot but allow the material to breathe and the characters to emerge thridimensional and human instead of drab caricatures drawn as plot devices, is a masterclass in storytelling that one would expect from a master of Bergman's calibre. The second half steadily accelerates, building up tension between the kidnappers and between them and the police, with some absolutely riveting pieces of suspense such as the cat and mouse game in the subway or the mother of the kidnapped girl making a sudden appearance at the house her daughter is being held to participate in a seance where the medium foreshadows her daughter's fate while she remains unaware, right down to the brilliant conclusion around a seance table where stage actor Patrick Magee has a cameo (Mr. Alexander from a CLOCKWORK ORANGE), Seance is a terrific piece of film-making that will particularly appeal to horror fans. Kim Stanley deserved that Oscar and so did Richard Attenborough (who would go on to sweep the Oscars with GANDHI), both of whom give electrifying performances as husband and wife."
