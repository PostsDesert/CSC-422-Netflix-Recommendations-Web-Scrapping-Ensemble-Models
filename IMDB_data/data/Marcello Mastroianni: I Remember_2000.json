        "reviewBody": "A sensitive documentary portraying in his own words, the great Italian actor Marcello Mastroianni. Film clips to go along with his life story. Although known as The Latin Lover after his starring role in La Dolce Vida, he claims it is not so. He maintains in his own words (Subtitled) that he was paid to play the role of the lover in his films and never even walked on the Via Veneto. Mastroianni made about 170 films and never had an aging problem because he had no problem playing characters that matched his age. He quite honestly said that at least 20 of his films were complete duds and some clips were shown on a couple of them. I'm surprised that there has not been a greater distribution of this film, particularly since it showed some of the older Italian movie directors who Scorcese and other American directors have openly copied from. For Italian film buffs, nostalgia at its best.",
