It doesn't say on the DVD but it had to be close to when the DVD was released in 2002.\n\nAs with other guys from the 1960s, Dave has become a somewhat fat older guy (haven't many of us?) but - like many of his contemporaries - can he still play!!! \n\nThis is excellent rock 'n roll.....the best songs that he and his former group \"Traffic\" put out many years ago. Dave still makes them sound terrific.",
