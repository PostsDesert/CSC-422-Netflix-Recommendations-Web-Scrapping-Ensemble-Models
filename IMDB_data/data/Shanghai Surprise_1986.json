Substitute \"fiancee\" for wife and one has Gigli.\n\nBut it is not- it is Shanghai Surprise, possibly the most ill-conceived movie of the 1980's (and yes, I have seen \"Hobgoblins.\")\n\nThis movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Ridiculous plot, painfully bad acting (Madonna as a missionary? She didn't buy it either, so she says her lines in a flat tone which just screams \"get me out of this costume and get me my check\"), cinematography worthy of an old episode of \"Fantasy Island,\" lame ending.\n\nIf, by some chance, you stumble across a copy of this in an unused corner of your local video rental store, call your local hazardous waste disposal hotline- do not rent it.\n\nBut do not forget that this horror exists. Some people forgot- and thus \"Gigli\" was born.",
