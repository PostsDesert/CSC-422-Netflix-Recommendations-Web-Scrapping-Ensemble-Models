Seven peasants unexpectedly inherit the farm on which they work after the farmer dies. The neighboring farmers view this as a breach of the rigid class structure in rural 19th century Austria and try to destroy the \"One-Seventh Farmers.\" The tenacity with which the new owners defend their farm (and one another) is very touching.
