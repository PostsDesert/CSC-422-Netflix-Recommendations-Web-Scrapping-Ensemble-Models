What set this series apart from others of its kind is this series focuses on the people not the robot. The Special Vehicles Unit 2 is made up of probably the most interesting mixd of people in the police force. The action sequences come quite few and far between (you won't find it in every episode), but it really delivers. For a TV series, the animation is one of the best looking and the most consistent I've ever seen."
