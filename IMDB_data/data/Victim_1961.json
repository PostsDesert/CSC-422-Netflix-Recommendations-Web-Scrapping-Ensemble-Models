        "reviewBody": "1961 in England. Homosexuals were routinely jailed just because they were homosexuals. It was still the love that dare not speak its name.\n\nBlackmailers had a terrific open season on gays - extorting funds for silence. It is incredible that this movie was made - on two levels. One being the obvious, who would want to star in such a controversial film?\n\nEnter one Dirk Bogarde, putting both his reputation and his career on the line. He moved deliberately beyond his \"Doctor in the House\" series of light romantic leading men to make this benchmark film.\n\nIt may seem dated today to some eyes, but it captures an authentic London of 1961 and is filmed on location in the streets for most of it. One can see the barriers, goofophiles, holding the passersby back from the location shooting! \"Flower Drum Song\" is featured on a marquee in one of the scenes.\n\nThe suspense is carried along beautifully, you are never sure how it is all going to turn out, there are no easy solutions, there are some wonderful sub-plots, unexpected little surprises, like the childhood friend of a victim staunchly loyal against his wife's homophobic wishes.\n\nThe husband and wife story is beautifully depicted and completely non-formulaic. I love the rush and buzz of London surrounding the taut, tense story. Groundbreaking film. 8 out 10.",
