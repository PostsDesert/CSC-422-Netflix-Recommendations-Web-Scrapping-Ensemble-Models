Whilst there have been many great US remakes of British comedy and lifestyle series (Changing Rooms -> Trading Spaces etc) often as not, the US -> UK conversions of shows doesn't work. This is a prime example.\n\nThe British hosts are largely unattractive and unappealing. Straight or bi, I know a cute guy when I see one, and the UK cast just aren't. Worse still, they're annoying, and have some lousy ideas on style. Also, as said by other commenters here, the UK cast JUST WEREN'T FUNNY like the US cast were. The US hosts' humour is what has put the original Queer Eye on the televisual map. It's completely lacking in the UK version.\n\nGenerally Americans adore us British guys, think we're stylish and cultured, often just because of the accent, but the UK hosts of Queer Eye let us down in this respect.\n\nBravo TV showed the UK version, and I have to say, I was embarrassed that of all the gay guys in the UK, this motley group was all they could come up with.\n\nAwful, just awful."
