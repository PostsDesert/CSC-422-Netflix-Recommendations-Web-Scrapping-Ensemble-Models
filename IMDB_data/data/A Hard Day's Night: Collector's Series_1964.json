        "reviewBody": "\"A Hard Days Night\" has got to be one of the funniest movies of all time, firmly holding its place with such classics as \"Annie Hall\" and \"Duck Soup\". It is also one of my top five favorite films of all time. The film proved that the Beatles could not only write and perform incredible songs, but that they could act as well. They are assisted in no small part by the extraordinary screenplay by Alun Owen. His dialogue is so unreasonable witty that even Groucho Marx himself would be impressed.\n\nIn \"A Hard Days Night\", we not only see the Beatles as great characters, but we also get some other outstanding characters, such as Paul's mischevious grandfather (Wilfred Brambell) and the dim-witted Norm and Shake (Norman Rossington and John Junkin).\n\nThis is a great film with great music and a great screenplay. I recommend this not only to avid Beatles fans, but to movie fans in general."
