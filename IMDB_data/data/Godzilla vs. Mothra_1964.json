        "reviewBody": "I sat down to watch the 1992 \"Gojira vs. Mosura\" (aka \"Godzilla and Mothra: The Battle For Earth\") without much of any particular expectations, aside from it being your average traditional \"Godzilla\" movie.\n\nAnd true enough, this is actually what \"Godzilla and Mothra: The Battle For Earth\" turned out to be, but there was just something about the storyline that made it just a tad more outstanding than your average, generic mass-produced \"Godzilla\" flick. Perhaps it was because of Mothra and Battra? I enjoyed that aspect of the movie quite a lot actually.\n\nThe special effects in the movie were good, and they definitely helped to bring the movie to life in a more enjoyable fashion. Sure, the movie was made in 1992, and the effects are showing their age. But still, there is just something charming about them still using miniature models in 1992.\n\nThe more of these movies I watch, the more both Godzilla and Mothra grow on me. And believe you me, I have sat through a lot of the older \"Godzilla\" movies by now.\n\nStorywise, then \"Godzilla and Mothra: The Battle For Earth\" turned out to be just another run-of-the-mill storyline and script made from the 'how-to-make-a-Godzilla-movie-for-dummies\". So don't go expecting a revolutionary chapter in the \"Godzilla\" franchise from writer Kazuki Ohmori and director Takao Okawara.\n\nBut all in all, an enjoyable and entertaining movie. I am rating \"Godzilla and Mothra: The Battle For Earth\" a solid six out of ten stars.",
