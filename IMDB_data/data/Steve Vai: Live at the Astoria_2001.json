This DVD is very good registration of the concert at the Astoria Club in London. Vai plays old songs and new songs and 2Hendrix covers witch he play very good. Most songs are instrumental. On the guitar he is really a freak and an artist and the DVD shows it all. The concert is nice to watch and the sound is good. The band around Vai are top musicians like Billy Sheehan. Sometimes the sound on this video is a little out of sync. The concert is recorded after September 11 2001 and Vai makes some comment about that. A good music DVD for guitar freaks and music lovers.",
