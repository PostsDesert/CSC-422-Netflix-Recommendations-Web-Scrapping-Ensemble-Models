Her desperate need to be accepted by her sister is constantly complicated by her drug and alcohol problems.\n\nBeyond anything else you can say about this film, it is a showcase for Jennifer Jason Leigh. She not only stars -- and sings -- but produced the film, and along with her mother (Barbara Turner) wrote the script, based on a real-life experience.\n\nThe casting of Ted Levine is interesting. Apparently he was cast to help distance him from the \"Buffalo Bill\" image he had acquired. But they made little attempt to modify his look. He still looks very much like Buffao Bill, though he is quite capable of altering his appearance by merely growing a mustache (see \"Monk\").",
