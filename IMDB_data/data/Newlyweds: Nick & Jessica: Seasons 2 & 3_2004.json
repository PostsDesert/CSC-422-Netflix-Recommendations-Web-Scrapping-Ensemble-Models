Nobody can come up with a unique and groundbreaking concept any more. It's all reality shows, sequels, and remakes. MTV has successfully put on the worst Super Bowl show ever, and has shown me how sleazy and worthless young adults can be. Real World has just become a collection of promiscuous, alcoholic kids. Real World/Road Rules challenge is the most worn out show I have ever seen. \"Reality\" shows need to be done with. MTV execs need to be shot.\n\nNewlyweds is a Saturday afternoon kind of show. There are a million better things to do than sit around and watch dumb rich kids make more money. It's like watching chimps play house."
