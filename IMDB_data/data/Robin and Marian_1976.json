        "reviewBody": "Most people are unaware of this movie's existence, despite an all-star cast. It is one of my favorite movies of all time.\n\nRobin Hood is an old man now, trying to tie together some of the pieces of his ideals. The familiar characters are also still around.\n\nThe most interesting thing about the movie is the insights it offers into the nature of heroism. Robin and the merry men were heroes because of what they believed in and their courage, not because they could shoot the straightest and run the fastest.\n\nThe gang can't jump fences or climb walls any more, or do much of anything that requires physical exertion. Their efforts are sometimes comical. But they are still great men because of what is inside of them.\n\nAudrey Hepburn is wonderful as the aging Marian, and look for the visual poetry of the three apples which are pictured in the opening as ripe and in the ending as withered, as are Rob and Johnny and Marian. There are many such metaphorical presentations which are not often seen in movies. I like to see a little of that visual poetry, even if it is a bit clumsy.\n\nNot a great film ... not a Grand Illusion or anything, but just a nice execution of a simple, touching concept."
