        "reviewBody": "EPISODE STORIES: Okay, let's be honest, the old plots of the old Looney Tunes series weren't exactly high and mighty themselves. These have decent story....they just suffer from poor execution and elements.\n\nCHARACTERS: Let me just say, these are entirely different \"toons\". I KNOW Bugs Bunny DOES NOT sound like Phillip \"Fry\" and Porky Pig DOES NOT sound like Tom Kenny. They are just made to look like this in the uncredible (unofficial) DVD feature.\n\nELEMENTS: Yuck! It just makes me sick thinking about it. People today are always trying to adjust old cartoon shows to match the formality of today's times. They would trow stuff in such as: Cellphones, Laserdisc DVDs, Starbucks, and fancy malls etc. Guess what? You don't really need all of that CRAP to make a good looney tunes cartoon. After all, that's not what got them where they are today. Wait a minute,(they're in a popularity rut) yes, on second thought, all of that 20th century junk IS what got them where they are right now. What I wouldn't give to see a good crisp Merrie Melodies: Looney Tunes cartoon set in 1950s again. \n\nANIMATION: Who the HELL thought to make a Looney Tunes cartoons in flash animation??!! SICKNING!!! I'm just disgusted. \n\nCONCLUSION: Who am I? I'm someone who wasn't even born when most of the classical cartoons were made. I'm a 12 year old who has seen and loved the old cartoons and hate the new ones because they stink.\n\nAvoid this crap. It takes minutes out of your life you will never get back.",
