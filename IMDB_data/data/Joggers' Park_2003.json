This is a tasteful treat, no melodrama, no junk, just a clean tasteful movie which is very well directed. Screenplay is good and the performances make each character so believable. Perizaad is half of Victor's age, but they both fall for each other. Or as they say in the movie \"You don't fall but rise in love\". This can happen to anyone. This is something so natural, and the Director and Story writer have beautifully handled something so delicate. In a normal case, I would have hated Victor's character for cheating on his wife, but at no point in the movie did I feel even slightly upset with him. Its a very good movie.",
