        "reviewBody": "Is it possible to make a Bruckheimer movie and not be stupidly loud and ugly?\n\nMaybe. At least there are some parts of this that make it seem so. But they are surrounded by parts that are so automatic and banal it seems that different directors were involved. Or there was a sort of Jekyll and Hyde swapping of personalities.\n\nFor example, there is the required Bruckheimer shot of two guys (sometimes it is a guy and a girl) running away from a car (or house) that they know will explode, then they lunge forward, pretending to be pushed by the shock of the fireball behind that fills the screen. Groan. I hope never to see that again. Ever. Each assassination causes our heroes to get blood splashed on their faces. There's a shootout with fishtanks... yeah, you've seen it before. At least there were no helicopter jumps onto speeding trains. There's an odd, odd choice in soundtrack; the severest action scenes have a sedate fifties action track behind them, obviously copied -- perhaps literally -- from that era.\n\nBut in between there are some elements that are uniquely styled. There's an opening sequence that is energetic, and essential to introducing us to a kickass female killer. There are some scenes with a \"Mr and Mrs Smith\" flavor where the mundane domestic love is allowed to breath and seem real. And deep.\n\nTwo guys directing, I think. Or one guy, two nations.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."
