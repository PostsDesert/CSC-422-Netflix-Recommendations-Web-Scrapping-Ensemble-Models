        "reviewBody": "Jim Brown is one cool dude, even when he's making a typical 70s blaxploitation flick.\n\nHere, he is an ex-Green Beret home from 'nam going after the mob thugs that killed his father.\n\nFirst, he has to get by their secret weapon, Stella Stevens, girlfriend of #2, Rip Torn, a racist that is just seething at the thought of Stevens between the sheets with Brown. And, boy, do they steam up those sheets! That must have been a shock to 70s audiences.\n\nNow, the thugs are not too bright as they try to run Brown down with a Mustang. Don't they know that this former fullback is one of the all time greats in NFL history? Their efforts to catch him in the casino meets with equal disaster as he runs right through them.\n\nOf course, you know Slaughter wins in the end because there is a sequel.\n\nOne interesting aspect for the younger folks is the IBM punch card that figures prominently in the film. They probably have never seen one.",
