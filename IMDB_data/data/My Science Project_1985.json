I guess it partly comes down to the characters in the movie. From nutty Dennis Hopper, to the kid who keeps referencing all those 1960s/1970s shows/movies, and to the lead character who just comes over as pleasing (in a non Michael J Fox-sort of way).\n\nBut also the ending, which I dare not give away.\n\nGranted, this is missing the mighty opening theme tune of the \"Back To The Future\" movies, but with the exception of the music, \"My Science Project\" wins hands down!"
