        "reviewBody": "OK let me get this out of the way first. Before watching this movie I thought it was going to be something like Shoalin Soccer but then with baseball. It has some similarities yet it's a very different movie. It's less action oriented and much more goofy. Ridiculous songs, characters straight out of a manga and a story of a 5 year old. I was left disappointed because I totally dig the idea of baseball with kung-fu moves.\n\nIt is very hard to describe this movie but I'll try and explain why it's so goofy. Everyone who dies in this movie comes back. One guy even comes back as a cyborg, because of \"advanced technology\" haha. There are like 2 or 3 songs in this movie and they have the most ridiculous lyrics. Then you have this guy who is something like a legend because he has the best pitch ever. A super tornado pitch or something like that. Now this is exactly why I was left disappointed because I was waiting for him to kill 1 or 2 bad guys with his super pitch but you never get to see it, only in his memories.\n\nIt has it's funny moments but it's so damn goofy that you're sometimes scratching your head and wondering what the hell your watching.\n\nDon't expect shoalin soccer with baseball, but if your into Japanese goofiness then don't miss it.",
