        "reviewBody": "I enjoyed this film, and I do slightly prefer it to the Jodie Foster version. True, the first 15 minutes were a bit slow, and some of the script was a bit weak, not to mention the rather predictable storyline. But you know what, the performances of Lindsey Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis more than compensated, their performances were really entertaining, and I felt the chemistry between them. I loved the soundtrack, and I thought it was very sensible updating the story, so that it would appeal more to someone like my 13 year old sister, who really enjoyed it. The script, while contrived in some places, was on the whole, very funny, and anyone who's seen the 1976 film, will get a more of the same film, except updated. What I did like, is that Lohan's character is a representation of all of us, someone who doesn't do mornings, doesn't always get on with her mum, and has friends and enemies. In the 1976 version, Jodie Foster's interpretation was more sensible than Lohan's, who put a bit of her other films in, which is quite appealing for this sort of film. Overall, an enjoyable film, with a 7/10. Bethany Cox",
