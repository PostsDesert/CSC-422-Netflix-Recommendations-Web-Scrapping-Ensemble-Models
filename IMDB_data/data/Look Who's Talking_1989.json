The only thing that can save a movie from being lost in the existing hash is a gimmick that makes it unique. Fortunately, \"Look Who's Talking\" gives a fresh perspective on an otherwise trite situation by demonstrating it from the baby's point of view. Even this could become annoying were it not for the fact that, rather than having a child actor flesh out the character, the clever, snappy dialogue is delivered by Bruce Willis in his most likeable role since \"Moonlighting\". Had they used a child's voice, lines such as \"Let's get some apple juice down here!\" would be merely cute; with Willis' smoky growl, they are hysterically funny."
