I first viewed it about 6 yrs ago while dining at restaurant in Panama City Beach FL and immediately requested information from the manager on how to obtain it. It took several weeks to locate it and since then it's been played many, many times. The additional screen savers when played on my PC and HD pictures were a very appreciated bonus. If you've ever scuba dived or wanted to, this will take you back to those mesmerizing, peaceful, and beautiful times. The quality of the filming is exquisite and captures the Great Barrier Reef about 1997 or 98 when it was still a pristine diving location filled with myriad types of fishes in crystal clear water.",
