        "reviewBody": "I was highly impressed with this production when I first saw it over ten years ago. The cinematography is very intimate, and does a fine job of showing some very picturesque coastal and rural scenery. The costuming and overall art direction is first class in both this production and it's followup \"Anne of Avonlea.\"\n\nThe acting is very rich and natural from all the female leads, though somewhat dry from the younger males. There's a touch of melodrama in all their performances, but this aspect reflects accurately I think the behavioral norms for the period.\n\nThe stories are personal reflections of author Lucy Maud Montgomery, set around Prince Rupert Island, and placed in a 3rd person narrative for her series of books. The books are once again transcribed to screenplay format for this mini series, and though I've never read the books I must say I'm very impressed with the production.\n\nThe blend of colors, costumes, acting talent and overall direction really make this and its sequel very enjoyable to watch. Sadly the third installment doesn't quite live up to the standards set by the first two mini series, but is still watchable.\n\nThe SFX were also very convincing (what few there were). I won't spoil the film by pointing them out, but nevertheless they help set the general visual feel of the characters, and better establish their ages.\n\nMyself, I'm a guns-n-spaceships movie kind of guy, but I do appreciate a gentle reflection on the more important things in life. In this case the story of the pains and fortunes of growing up. I highly reccomend this to anyone who needs a break from real life or wants a change in pace from the usual Hollywood offerings."
