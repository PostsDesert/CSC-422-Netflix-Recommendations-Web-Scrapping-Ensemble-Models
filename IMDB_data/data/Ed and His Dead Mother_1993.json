Although, I have discovered, while watching with groups, that this movie is not for everyone. Some of my friends feel as though it is TOO unbelievable a storyline, making it hard to watch. I feel as though the unrealistic concept is WHAT makes this movie the gem that it is. I also feel as though the supporting cast is fantastic... Of course, it doesn't have the greatest acting in the world...and once again, that is part of its' cultish charm!",
