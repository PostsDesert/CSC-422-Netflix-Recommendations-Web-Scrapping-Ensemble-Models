The beautiful golden tones of the exterior scenes draws me into the film like a sunset at the lakeshore draws me into my own summer memories.\n\nThe dialog and mood feel very natural and believable. Some reviewers criticise the lack of a more \"profound\" script. To me, it is exactly that lack that makes this film work. The characters and their problems seem real and because of that, I care about what happens to them.\n\nThe bottom line is that all the parts come together to create a whole that feels right.",
