        "reviewBody": "I watched a couple of episodes on youtube and enjoyed them. Unlike some of the other reviewers I saw plenty of martial arts in the shows I watched. I liked the animation and the characters were drawn large. Overall its a very well produced show. The plots are nothing special but probably better than most. The bad guys, especially Shadow Master are very cool. This show has something, kinda hard to define but its there. Of course Double Dragon was a great video game series. The parts with the masks didn't bother me at all, sorta a bonus actually. I also like the dragon that leads them to secret spots the boys need to get to. There is also a degree of character development unlike some toons. Basically its a 90s toon with a cool 80s vibe. I liked very much that it doesn't look at all like anime which I don't much care for. For whatever reason I like Double Dragon more than the DC comics stuff like Batman...I do kinda dig the Superman shows though. Check it out, it doesn't take itself to seriously and its provides more fun than most.",
