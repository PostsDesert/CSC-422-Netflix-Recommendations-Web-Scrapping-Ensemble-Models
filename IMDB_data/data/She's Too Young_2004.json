        "reviewBody": "This film is perhaps one of the most viewer friendly accurate description of teen life. There were strong performances all the way around. Alexis Dziena shines bright as the lead character in this film. This film takes an unparalleled view of teen sex but it also takes a view at teen curiosity in general. This is a very important film for not just all parents to watch but teens also, since it is about them. It is important for teens to know what is going on inside and outside of their high school. At the same time it is alarming to see how many sexually active teens there are presently today. Even though I've been out of high school for only 3 years, I know it has changed significantly since I've attended. Another good reason to view this film is for individuals to see that high school isn't as sugar-coated and \"G\" rated as \"Saved by the Bell\" and many of the teen shows from the 90's make it out to be. Teens becoming sexually active with more than one individual is real. It's time for us to start watching more movies and shows like this that alarms us of this matter.",
