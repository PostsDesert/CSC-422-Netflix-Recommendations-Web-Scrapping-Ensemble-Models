There's a nude scene with the female character that is completely unnecessary. The plot & dialogue are pretty unoriginal, however, this movie can become quite amusing if you apply the \"Mystery Science Theatre 3000\" mantra of making fun of it the whole time (\"Mummy\" jokes were particuarly helpful). It does manage to keep your interest though."
