        "reviewBody": "Ford Fairlane (Andrew Dice Clay) is known as the Rock n' Roll Detective. He's a hard-smoking, womanizing, Hollywood private eye who is well connected in the music scene. Jazz (Lauren Holly) is his loyal assistant. Everybody pays him in gifts. Lead singer Bobby Black and his band is supposed to be the new sensation. He ODs on stage during a performance. His school friend obnoxious shock-jock Johnny Crunch hires him to find his daughter-sister-daughter Zuzu Petals. Crunch is quickly killed. Investigating cop Lt. Amos (Ed O'Neill) has an old grudge against him. The Kid hires him to find his dad. Colleen Sutton hires him to find her sister Zuzu Petals. Zuzu turns out to be a groupie to Bobby Black. There's a crazed hit-man (Robert Englund) and record executive Julian Grendel (Wayne Newton).\n\nIt's crass, it's loud, and it's irreverent. I can certainly see many being offended by Andrew Dice Clay's crude character. For me, it's funny. It's basically an alternate world where Andrew Dice Clay's alter-ego exists. He's actually funnier when he's being a little stupid. There're some fun back-and-forth with Zuzu. For people not easily offended, this is good crass irreverent fun.",
