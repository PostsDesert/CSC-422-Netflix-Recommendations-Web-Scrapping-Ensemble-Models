        "reviewBody": "First off, I really enjoyed this series. I have to preface with that so that I don't feel too bad pointing out the things I found disappointing. I remember seeing the series just after it came out, and have been waiting patiently to see it on DVD (since this rarely happens with Fan-subs). But lo, and behold, here it is! Congrats guys! Now for the caveats: This is not the gore-fest it advertises. I'm not saying that there's no violence. No no, there's plenty of blood and gore, but over the course of the 24 episode series you really only have a handful of good bloody battles. Personally I don't think this mars the storyline at all, in fact the story builds itself to the point where I was more interested in seeing more character development than another fight. But if you're wanting a gore-fest, go somewhere else.\n\nAnd I was disappointed by the voice-actor chosen for the role of Souji, the female captain of the group. I'm not saying that she did a bad job, but when I saw this for the first time it was in Japanese with subtitles. The English dubbed voice-overs completely change the char of Souji into a somewhat androgynous character, and make her hard to relate to, mostly because you spend most of the first several episode playing \"Guess that Gender\".\n\nHowever, aside from those two caveats, I highly recommend this series! Great story, great dialog, and a real attempt at telling a great yard in an unconventional way!",
