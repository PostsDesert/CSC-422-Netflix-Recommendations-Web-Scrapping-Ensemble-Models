I barely even sniggered. But I still liked it - this is possibly due to the fact I'm a sucker for romance (and awwwww Jay Mohr's character is soooo sweet!) and I like Jennifer Aniston (but what is going on with her clothes and make-up in this film?!). The acting is pretty solid, with all the cast quite likable, but hmmmm... plot-wise - well, where was it really?! And as for the ending!\n\nAfter all that build-up, it is such an anti-climax!\n\nStill, it's one of those films that's hard to dislike with any real vigour because there's so little to it. Instantly forgettable, yet sweet all the same."
