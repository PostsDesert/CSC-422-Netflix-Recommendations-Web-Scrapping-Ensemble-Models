        "reviewBody": "I wish they had saved the German version of this one, but alas, only the AIP version seems to turn up, though most versions are barely longer than the one USA network ran in their infancy. What was once given an \"X\" rating, barely rises above PG-13 standards for this new millennium. Dullea, fresh from \"2001\", is out of place amidst the tame exploitation, but gives it a good try. John Huston, in the midst of a long string of aging weirdo roles, steals the show easily. The script by Richard Matheson, is well done, but manhandled by the multiple directors different approaches, and the different exploitation requirements of the various producers. It easily extends the normal AIP formula, but falls short of it's goal to cross into more \"Adult\" film-making. Not worthless, but not all that thrilling, with much \"dead Air\"",
