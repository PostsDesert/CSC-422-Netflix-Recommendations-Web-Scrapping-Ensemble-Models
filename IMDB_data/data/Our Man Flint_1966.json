        "reviewBody": "This was the America's answer to Bond, a super agent Derek Flint, and James Coburn plays his part with an outstanding flair. Flint is more scientific in his approach when attacking problems. He's also more lavish and colorful (he's into ballet and stuffs James Bond will never be engaged in). He has more girls, and he's a millionaire to boot ! What more can you expect from this super human hero ? American spirit of independence is also evident in that he's not an \"agent\" of any government agency, but an independent \"consultant\". The colors are brighter, and actions more wild. If James Bond was Aston Martin, Derek Flint is a drag racer. There's nothing this man of iron, with science, money, and charm can't accomplish.\n\nIn hind sight I can see how difficult it might have been to out Bond a Bond in this type of movie, and Saul David and Daniel Mann did a masterful job of conjuring up a secret agent a la American style. Is it just my imagination or is James Bond starting to look more like Derek Flint after 40 years with his scentific weapons and out landish story lines ?\n\nJames Coburn was at top of his game, and I wished he'd done more sequels to this franchise. Colorful '60s; looking at this film really convinces you that there was something special about that era.",
