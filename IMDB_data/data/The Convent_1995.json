It's not boring in any way, but spectators need to be aware of the kind of movie they're going to watch.\n\nDeneuve, Malkovich, and the Portuguese actor Silveira and Cintra are all able to create an atmosphere of metaphysical mystery, in dealing to all the questions about all books, convents or even the devil.\n\nThank god there are still movies that make you think and don«t give you all the answers so that you forget just after leaving the theater.\n\nGreat scene the one where the \"devil\" runs through the forest... don't miss it!!!",
