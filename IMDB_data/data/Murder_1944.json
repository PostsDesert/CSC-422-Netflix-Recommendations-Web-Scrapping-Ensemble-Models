That night, Larry (Bill Williams) spends the night there. In the morning, he has disappeared. The following night, Steve (Donald Cook) stays the night there with a similar outcome. On the 3rd night, it is the turn of the Jazzy Belles.....can they solve the mystery...?...\n\nThis is a quick paced mystery with musical numbers courtesy of the Jazzy Belles. They sing and dance for 2 numbers and have a 3rd dance routine, all of which are good and performed in an Andrews Sisters swing style. A 3rd song is sung by the party host Anne Gwynne and is dubbed by Martha Tilton - that's why it sounds so good! The mystery keeps you guessing and the film is played as a comedy ...... and there's a ghost....!",
