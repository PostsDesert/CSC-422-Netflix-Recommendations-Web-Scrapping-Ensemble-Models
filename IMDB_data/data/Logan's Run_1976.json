        "reviewBody": "I love this movie for a number of reasons It's got a wonderfully original storyline, eye candy visuals, great 1970's hairdos, doesn't require a PHD to figure out and is just plain fun to watch. I know there are some people on this site that have dissected Logan's Run like a frog in Science Class and have dismissed it for some short comings. But if you attempt to watch this movie by holding a magnifying glass up to it and comparing it's special effects and sets to films like Star Wars, you're not going to enjoy it because it doesn't compete on that level. It's strength is an emphasis on the human condition and rebelling against a regimented society that lies to it's people and the special effects are just along for the ride. Also unlike Star Wars, I look at this movie as a period piece because it's a 1970's perspective on one possible future society and watching it (especially now)you never forget that. Yes it's dated, but like many things from the 70's reminds us of a simpler time and place we can remember fondly."
