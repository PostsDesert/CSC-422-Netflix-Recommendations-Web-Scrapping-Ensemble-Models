Like many other pointed out - the only thing similar to the story is the fact that there is indeed an eclipse on 6 sun world. The director decided to build the movie around the point where everyone go insane and start burning things. Which is an important part of the story, but not THE most important one. Not to mention the use of SUPER POWERS? \"Hmmm... this story is nice, but let's add superpowrs to it! Yeah, that should make them watch it!\" Err, not. To sum it all up - If you read the book, don't see this, it has little to do with the story and you will just sit and say \"Ehhh... he can light flames with his mind?\". I know i did :)"
