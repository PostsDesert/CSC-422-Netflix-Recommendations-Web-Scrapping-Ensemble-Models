        "reviewBody": "I really like this movie.\n\nStefania has just broken up with her beau of 8 years, Andrea. Her rebellious 14-year-old niece Martina, scusi Megghy, bails out of her girl scout trip to convince her mom to let her romp through Europe alone. But her grandmother decides that Megghy should stay with her aunt since she will be alone. Megghy persuades Stefania to take her to Ios in Greece, the island of love. But Stefania doesn't know that Megghy plans to lose her virginity to a stranger because she believes that she turns off guys because they can tell she's still a virgin\n\nStefania is absolutely gorgeous and her sense is humorous. Megghy on the other hand got slightly annoying. All her whining was getting on my nerves. Also she runs with her arms flailing. Very funny. Andrea is lovely and you can really tell he loves his girlfriend. I didn't expect the end to turn out the way they did. I love the bus scene. It's so cute!\n\nI was wondering about that Indian music. I guessed I was getting Greek and Indian music confused but I was right that it was Indian. I actually learned the song at the end by a lot of playbacks.\n\nI highly recommend this movie.",
