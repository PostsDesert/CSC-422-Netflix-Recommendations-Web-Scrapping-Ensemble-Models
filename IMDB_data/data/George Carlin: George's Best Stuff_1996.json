Everything from the Seven dirty words, stuff, baseball and football, cars and driving, monopoly and dogs and cats had me in stitches. There is also a little added bonus for Carlin fans (like me), the stuff bit is not from Carlin on campus, but from the first ever Comic relief. Funny compilation, even if it isn't all perfect. A+",
