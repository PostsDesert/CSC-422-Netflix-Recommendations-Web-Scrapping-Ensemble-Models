        "reviewBody": "Chris Rock is a poet and a preacher, to watch him in full swing delivering his chisled lines is always wonderful.\n\nIf you've seen Bring the Pain and Bigger and Blacker, you'll know exactly what to expect as Rock pretty much continues where he left off, covering the same ground of politics, relationships, the black condition and his interpretation of celebrity crimes.\n\nHis delivery is smooth, forceful as ever and very confident. This particular act falls down when he tries to discuss Iraq. Not intending to make a joke but a serious point, he literally wastes 10 minutes of airtime not being funny. I think this may be in homage to his Hero Bill Hicks. (Very spookey listening to BH discuss Iraq 10-15 years ago today)\n\nWatch Bring the Pain, then Bigger and Blacker and then if you have time watch this one.",
