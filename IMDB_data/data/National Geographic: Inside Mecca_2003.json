        "reviewBody": "There is much to look at and perhaps like the 9-11 commission report much to learn.I felt upon looking at the sequences of events, as events unfolded on the \"Zero Day\" disk that there was next to no ability to get the right information into the right hands.There was a real inability to place the in earnest taunts made by terrorist ring leaders and as well the indignity to learn that free enterprise was not very freedom like,perhaps at all.The shame is that the human race seems to be the goal of the likes of such a purpose and what exactly is this purpose?It is for acceptance as a pre-requisite to saturation.The need to succumb humanity to a margin is part of the need to use as well to own even the very skin of the human kind.It is a veiled conceit of global conquest.The requirement to make humanity a virtual hostage in this global attempt of saturation has provided the kind of witness that this picture discusses on a most held holiday in a \"Christmas Holiday\".It is hereby suggested that the need for such influence as a prerequisite to acceptance was likened to a \"spearhead\" in a military campaign.This campaign though is likened as well to a dangerous poison that is airborne.It is something of the hidden,perhaps invisible but most certainly not ordinarily thought of as the source of inspiration.It is the very nature of this attempt at some global consideration and that is the technology is in fact the \"spearhead\" as to this suggested attempt.Certainly a bunch of desert rats do not really add up to a hill of beans but failure as to candor has allowed that very real disaster to materialize.The failure that such arrogance suggests is that the greater global community does not do very well under the authority of any power and most importantly such a power whereby the message is an attempt of the very make-up of humanity.From behavior models to actual designs of the very construct of society,this violation has taken the place of honest candid repore with such Laws as to be unrecognizable.If there is anything that foreign lands provide it is the kind of witness whereby not only are you not what you seem but you are not even a natural presence.In you there is the witness as to you but also you are the system that brought you here to begin with.That is a problem whereby this world is not known however it is also not what it seems.This agent of a foreign power is the underpinning to its success and even ultimately its success is a more greater care because there are some very dangerous days ahead.This is where this super power has occurred whereby now we need a convincer and the force ultimately aligned with supporting such an inconstant position steps in to quell an uprising.America is that way and its very unwelcomed purpose is at the source of the outgrowth of terrorism.The rise of the terrorist networks it was suggested were a result of a foreign power with undue influence.National Geographic wanted to suggest and perhaps did suggest something that maybe true.That we do not wish to believe that such evil as this comment suggests such evil exists actually in fact does exist.I'am of the opinion that it matters little who is to be a martyr,even what race of people because the cause is a cause that has been around for a very long time.The instrument as to its place this time is the advent of the 20th Century and the rise of a foreign power in a un-natural and unseen presence.Tela-communications is taken from the Greek in an act of Telapathy.Is it merely this or merely that,it is in fact more than as suggested by the 1010 Wins broadcast,it is more than merely one single event it is to be certain as yet to be dealt with as a messenger is a messenger of death,a purpose indeed foreign.This event was as much a failure as it was an act of terror.The purpose of one side it seems is not so foreign as the other but more importantly and this is indeed on the increased knowledge idea there is a need here to know better of who and how this world works.It is a terrible slight to humanity to be picked for such a purpose but such a purpose is as suggested been around for a long time.The having of power over another,the using of others for an unethical purpose,the inability to determine a position without something of an irrational encroachment occurring and indeed the taking advantage of peoples foreign or domestic whereby nothing is natural nor even responsible in a subversive and suggestive hysteria that such an overseer provides.It, these arguments and like circumstances were written about some time ago and they were part and parcel of a Fascist politic which also reveled in hysteria.Television,like radio,like news services become only the central point from which this influence comes from and from where much association is adjoined.The terrorist is the one that talks to you in the night with no strings and no radio no television but as yet such an ability is no more foreign than in hearing voices as both are true and both are very legitimate complaints as to the rise of this foreign power looking very much like a Fascist conceit.It is no different this conceit anymore than it was foreign to begin with.The Networked World is merely the equal to a flying carpet and indeed in a very short order a magnitude of 10 escalates to a hard to recognize state.We have a very real and terrifying problem and that this problem has been as a result of what we are not rather than of who we are.",
