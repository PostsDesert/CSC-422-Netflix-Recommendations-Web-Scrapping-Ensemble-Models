        "reviewBody": "John Wayne stars as Montana cattle rancher Duke Fergus. He heads to San Francisco to conduct some business and ends up losing his shirt at the Barbary Coast gambling dens, particularly that of Tito Morell (Joseph Schildkraut). Duke vows to master the gambling arts and return to Frisco, not just for revenge, but to win the hand of Morell's showgirl moll Flaxen Tarry (Ann Dvorak). This being turn-of-the-century San Francisco, you just know that the Great Earthquake is going interrupt everyone's plans.\n\nThis was another of Republic's \"A\" pictures, with time spent on costumes, sets, and expensive set-pieces (such as the earthquake sequence, or a large cattle drive). The movie isn't terrible, but the script is bit weak, like in most of these Republic showcases. There's never a good rhythm established to the narrative, and the three main characters never rise above sketches. Dvorak looks good, but if that's her real singing voice heard on the soundtrack, it's pretty awful. Still, if one likes SF earthquake melodrama and adventure, this may be worth checking out. It earned two Oscar nominations, for Best Sound, and Best Score.",
