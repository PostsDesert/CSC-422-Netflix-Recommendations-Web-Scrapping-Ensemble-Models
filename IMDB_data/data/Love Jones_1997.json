The hardest role in a movie may BE to perhaps, play someone that you'd see everyday, or someone that you'd be everyday, and they pull it off so naturally. It just reminded me SO much about how me and my peeps would kick it on weekends...one couch...snacks, and crazy stories and philosophies on life. I love nights like that. To add to it, who WOULDN'T want to have the type of relationship that Nia and Larenz endured? Good or Bad...it was so sexy and warm and black and beautiful...Definitely a keeper, and PACKED with unforgettable quotes that ALL can relate to. Definitely somethin for the movie collection."
