We found ourselves talking to the movie and giving each other \"the look\" when something crazy happened...Like oh unh uh. Pretty much 50% of Tracey Morgan's lines are good one-liners!\n\nPaula Jai Parker's character was very different for her and I have to say it was a dramatic change for the better. Alan Payne is still gorgeous to me. LOL!\n\nI understand this movie was scheduled to release but didn't because of delays. I'd actually never heard of it and just stumbled across it Blockbuster.",
