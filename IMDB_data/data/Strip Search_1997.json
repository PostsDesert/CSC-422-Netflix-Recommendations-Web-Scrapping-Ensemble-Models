        "reviewBody": "First of all let me tell you that the person who wrote the Synopsis for Blockbuster didn't see the movie. There are reviewers who look at the movie but don't actually see it, but this person could not have even been in the room. The plot is only remotely related to the description. I will tell you up front that it is badly scripted. There are six really bad lines by the first shoot out. Also the guy Robby (Pare') calls \"Seven\" should be \"Eight\" as he killed \"Seven\", seconds before, unless you don't count the head scum. So, some of the dialog is pretty lame. The action is not. Sela is the stepmother, not the brother although I may be guilty of making a too subtle distinction here. Her eyes being different colors (which they don't appear to be on my 159 inch screen) are symbolic of the sexual confusion she lives with what with having been thru a sex change operation. This isn't Raymond Chandler folks but it works for me. The action is good. The skin show is good. The lesbian thing is played only for one shot at humor & I guess a way for Sela to get her hooks into Pam Grier's police character. An interesting side note: it looks like the uncle is played by the same guy in the exact same way as the uncle in Dark City. It worked beautifully in Dark City; not so well here. It is definitely a man's movie. I would rate it as a truly entertaining B movie. By the way the title has nothing to do with the story but that is typical of mystery & action films. Only occasionally do titles mean anything. And give Michael Pare' a break guys, he says his lines with a straight face & shoots people. What more can one ask from a former Canadian male model. drss1942 December 08,2006",
