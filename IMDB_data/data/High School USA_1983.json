        "reviewBody": "High School USA is one of those sunday afternoon feel good type comedies. It is packed full of familiar faces which make the characters all the more endeering. This film has to be among my personal favorites almost solely on the merits of a classic comedic performance from Crispin Glover. His portrayal of nerdy misfit \"Archie Feld\" remains for me one of the most unforgetable and entertaining characters I've seen on screen. For those of you who didn't get enough of (Michael J.)Fox and Glover in \"Back to the Future\" you'll find more gut busting antics from the Duo here. High School USA is a hidden gem in American \"High School\" genre films and you will certainly enjoy this warm \"hero wins the girl\" adventure."
