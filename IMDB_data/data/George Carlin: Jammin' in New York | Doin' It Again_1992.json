        "reviewBody": "Politics, media manipulation, environmentalism, war-mongering, social issues, airplanes are well explored. The wit is evident and the wordplay stellar. Delivery is slightly uneven in the middle as the words are much stronger than any physical comedy. Then George steps up the sarcasm about a rant of sensentional media macabre reality and brings it home with the Save The Planet concept flipped around.\n\nA precious standup with a few quirks and amazing content. Highly recommended. 30 years later it works well, excpet maybe for the fashion lol. A timeless funny classic with lots of deep social truths!",
