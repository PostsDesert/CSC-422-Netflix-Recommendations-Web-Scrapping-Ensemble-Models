        "reviewBody": "Welcome to the story of a single but very rich man who finally is going to marry a woman that he never saw in an arranged marriage, and it will turned out to be an astonishing surprise, after he discovers how beautiful this woman is, and then it will be a living nightmare when she reveals through strange actions that she's not the one he would marry. This story is more familiar to new audiences who might have watched the horrendous \"Original Sin\" (2001) with Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas in the main roles. The only vantage that the remake has over Truffaut's film is the awesome sex scenes which makes voyeuristic viewers go crazy over the bold moments of a poor film.\n\nThe French version has Catherine Deneuve and Jean-Paul Belmondo in a more romantic story that breaks into a good thriller. It has some weak moments but still a good film that is directed by one of the most incredible and hard working directors of all time. The performers are elegant, and the way both actors portray their roles, in a mysterious and complex style makes of \"Mississippi Mermaid\" a very intriguing film where the next moment is the most interesting, the most awaited, it's full of surprises (by the way the ending is different than the one unbelievably made in the remake).\n\nWatch it without creating too much expectations and you'll enjoy it. 9/10",
