        "reviewBody": "Matthew Harrison and Kevin Corrigan have come up a quirky movie in which there are a lot of ideas. Some of them come across and others fail, but the film is worth a look because it has good performances. The first half of the movie has excellent pacing, as it moves quickly with all that's going on.\n\nMichael Rapaport makes an excellent appearance as Stretch. This is an actor that always delivers. He is always effective in whatever he plays. Kevin Corrigan's Redmond shows enough confusion as he moves through the different situations. It's not his best role, but having an interest in the film, since he co-wrote the screen play, might have had a toll on him. Linda Fiorentino, Lily Taylor, James Woods and Burt Young make great contributions in an assortment of New York characters.\n\nOne of the funniest scenes is at the beginning of the movie when Uncle Sam steals the car and tries to get rid of the dog he finds inside. The shooting scenes are amazing because no one is shot, even at close range. Don't ever show this film to Quentin Tarantino, as he will probably have a panic attack!",
