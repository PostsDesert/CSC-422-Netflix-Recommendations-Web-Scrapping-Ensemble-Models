It's also extremely colorful and the '60s clothing is a hoot to see once again (yeah, I remember it well.) This is the like the TV-program \"Laugh-In,\" but with a dumb story.\n\nI have no complaints looking at Elizabeth Hurley (\"Vanessa Kensington\") and Michael Myers (\"Austin Powers\"), with his crooked teeth, stupid grin and ridiculous sayings made me laugh. This is a very fast-moving film, a spoof of James Bond and a spoof of the crazy '60s. \n\nThe 90 minutes go by quickly.",
