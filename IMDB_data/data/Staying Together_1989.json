Talking about movies, Llyod made the comment that \"a girl always gets naked in a Coming of Age film.\" In this case, Llyod was correct. Along with the story lines of redemption, meaning, and brotherhood, Daphne Zuniga appears naked as well. A wonder look into the lives of three brothers and their transformation into adulthood in the center of small town, USA. Great character development and a wonderful story. All in all, a good movie",
