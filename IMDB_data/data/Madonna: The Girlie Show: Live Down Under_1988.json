        "reviewBody": "I remember when this show came to Sydney and Madonna was in the news walking out of the airport with a didgeridoo in her hand. It was entertaining to have a major pop star in Australia. I would have bought a ticket but I was only 16 at the time and I wasn't going to go in the city by myself. Anyway, as for the show it was good to see a release on DVD and the footage here is consistent. This show was more theatrical than the Blond Ambition tour, and some of the best performances are when she sings \"Like a Virgin\" with a Marlene Dietrich inspired accent, and the costumes for the \"Justify My Love\" number. Overall one of her most entertaining shows.",
