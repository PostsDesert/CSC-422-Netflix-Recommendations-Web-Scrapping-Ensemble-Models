        "reviewBody": "Put all thoughts of Sgt. Bilko and The Pink Panther out of your mind: let us remember Steve Martin when he was at the top of his game, an uproariously funny comic with his own special brand of zany physical humour. All Of Me, directed by Carl Reiner, sees Martin starring as Roger Cobb, a struggling lawyer who unwittingly becomes host to the spirit of recently deceased millionairess Edwina Cutwater (Lily Tomlin) after her plan to transmigrate her soul into the body of stableman's daughter Terry (Victoria Tennant) goes terribly wrong.\n\nWith Edwina controlling one half of Roger's body, the silver haired comedian is given ample opportunity to showcase his wacky style of comedy and does so with gusto; the result is a memorable central performance from Martin in a consistently funny film that also sees co-star Tomlin on fine form as the lonely rich woman who, in death, learns to enjoy life and who finally makes a friend.\n\nBreezy direction from Reiner ensures a lively pace, the action accompanied by a suitably jazzy score, with comedy highlights including Roger visiting the men's room with a little help from Edwina (tap tap), a hilarious courtroom scene wherein Edwina takes control while Roger sleeps, and a wonderfully silly bedroom scene where Roger attempts to have sex with Terry while Edwina is taking a nap.",
