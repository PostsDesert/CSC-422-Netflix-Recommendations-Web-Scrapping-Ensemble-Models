        "reviewBody": "Is there a subject that the Baby Einstein team have not covered? Well this is a good one as it helps to show us about the different parts of the boy. In regards to format it is pretty much the same as usual, but I do like the way this one is about a specific topic.\n\nMy little girl often points to her nose and screams 'nose' when she is watching, which is the kind of results I want. I also like the way that they use famous names to relate to the subject that they are dealing with, in this case Da Vinci.\n\nI did find the extras section lacking a bit in this title and also found that my DVD jumped quite a bit (however I do not know if this was just a bad copy - unlucky I guess). The puppets are also OK, but they seem to have run out of amusing things to do.\n\nIf you have been through the basic collection of Einstein DVDs then this is another one I would add to your collection. There are good and bad points but overall it is a mostly enjoyable experience for your children.",
