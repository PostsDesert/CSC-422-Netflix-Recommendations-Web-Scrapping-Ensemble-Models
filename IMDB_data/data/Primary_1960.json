Before the media age had turned political\n\ncampaigns into impersonal commercials, even the stars (in this case,\n\nKennedy and Humphrey) had to go out and press the flesh, hard.\n\n While Kennedy is slicker and seems to have the more organized\n\nmachine behind him, he is still a saint of apprachability compared to\n\ntoday's most folksie candidate. That's just how it was done before T.V.\n\nhad compleatly eaten us alive.\n\n Some of the stuff with the affable, tireless Humphrey is\n\nparticuairly memorable. Speaking to a bunch of stone faced Wisconson\n\nFarmers, his giddy style takes on a real comic poniency, he's like a\n\ncomic trying to loosen up Ed Gein.\n\n Yet, you get from both candidates, yes, corny as it may sound,\n\nthey actually give a curse about the people they are talking to. If you\n\nthink that has all but vanished, as I do, you may find this film as\n\nstriking as I do. Some of the camera crew went on to \"Don't Look Back\"\n\nand \"Gimmie Shelter\". 8 out of 10."
