        "reviewBody": "The sub-genre of horror, often hit or miss, has divided horror movie lovers ever since it became mainstream in 1970s. Personally, slashers can be really good if they're done right, with a good story, scares, nice atmosphere, and memorable scenes. This one has it all, and that's why it is so popular even today.\n\nAlong with other influential slasher classics of the 1970s, like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween and Black Christmas, they created iconic horror villains many TV shows and films try to copy or spoof.\n\nI've watched this one a couple of times, when I was a kid, teenager, young adult, all with different people, and it never gets old or boring. The atmosphere of summer camp in the late 1970s is perfect and nostalgic. Music to create tension is great. Acting is okay, with majority of actors being surprisingly good, if you consider time it was released.\n\nFriday the 13th franchise is perfect fun for summer nights, or to watch through month of Halloween!",
