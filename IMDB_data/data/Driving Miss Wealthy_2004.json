Funny scenes are really funny, sad scenes are sad, acting is (at least) very good. It's not a complicated movie (if you check the whole plot, you can see it's a bit simple), but it's still excellent. I've seen many quite similar movies lately, and this one is really good.\n\nI think it's a best pick for anyone who likes the romantic-comedy movies. Maybe you will like some other more, but this one won't be bad for sure.\n\nI recommend it.",
