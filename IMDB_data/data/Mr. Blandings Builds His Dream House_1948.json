        "reviewBody": "This is a pretty good comedy, with several good screwball-type sequences, and yet its silliness also contains some commentary, sometimes pointed, and much of it still pertinent. Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are well-suited to this kind of material, and the script provides good dialogue and some amusing situations for them and the rest of the cast to work with.\n\nThis is certainly of particular interest to anyone who has ever faced either the kind of home-buying experience that the Blandings family goes through, or one of the many other similar experiences that life offers. The whole picture of having to deal with a bewildering assortment of contractors, workmen, lawyers, and who knows what else, is a very familiar feature of modern life, even for those who do not buy their own homes. The movie helps to point out some of the basic absurdities all of this, while providing some good humor.\n\nThe two sub-plots - the one with Melvyn Douglas and the other with Grant looking for the new slogan - are worked in rather resourcefully, so as to parallel some of the basic themes of the main story about the house, while also providing comic complications in the main plot.\n\nGrant has the knack of making the wildest situations seem believable at the time, and even somewhat sophisticated. Loy's charm and elegance make her a very good complement to Grant's character. It's a good combination overall."
