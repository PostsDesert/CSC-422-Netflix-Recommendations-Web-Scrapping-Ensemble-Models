Dutton for his Courageous work and dedication to be able to complete 'the Corner', based on the true story. America needed to see this, finally a story that showed the puppet act with strings attached. I recommend this story to be educational with parental guidance. The blessings of some are simply not enough. I really saw hope in the character's: Fran, Blu & Scoogie."
