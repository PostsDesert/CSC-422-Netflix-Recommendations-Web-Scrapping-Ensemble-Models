        "reviewBody": "It doesn't seem like it has been More than 20 years since this pilot hit the air. When you look at it now and see dial pay phones and no cell phones, you realize it has been.\n\nThe main plots in the pilot involves model Maddie Hayes being taken for all her money by bogus financial advisor's & $4 million dollars in smuggled diamonds that Maddie & David Addison accidentally stumble onto. This pilot relies upon two things which made the entire series a major success. The chemistry between Bruce Willis & Cybill Shepherd is the main thing. A clever script is the other.\n\nWhile the script is a fresh approach, some of the sequences go back to classic material. The main finale sequence featuring some stunts, a tall building with a clock, and some breath taking moments draws upon the silent classic SAFETY LAST from Harold Lloyd for its inspiration. \n\nAll in all, this pilot is extremely effective introducing everyone and providing some top notch 1980's era music in its sound track. It is a key building block from which the rest of the series takes off on.",
