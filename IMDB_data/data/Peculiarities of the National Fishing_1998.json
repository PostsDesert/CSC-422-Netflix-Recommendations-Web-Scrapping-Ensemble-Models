        "reviewBody": "OK, I don't understand somethings written in these posts. First, although there definitely is national humour, let's face it, funny is funny; hence the international appeal of Charlie Chaplin, the Simpsons, etc. So this non-sense about it not being for Americans is simply bull. I'm an American, I understood it. Second, no where in the film or its predecessor is there a 'russian for Russians,' or whatever non-sense was posted. While they reflect on their country, I don't think this is something only Russians can understand. Also, humour about drunks, be it Russians on Vodka, Moravians on slivovice, Czechs on beer, Irish on whiskey, (insert your own nationality) on (insert your own national drink), is quite funny. If you don't get that, then either don't watch films about drinking, or try drinking often enough that all the things you try to accomplish simply don't happen (just as in the films). Like I said, funny is funny, and that is something that knows no boarders (sorry for the cheesy ending!).",
