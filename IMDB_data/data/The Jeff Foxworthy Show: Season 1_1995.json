I thought this was a very good clean show that the family could watch instead of the garbage we see today. It wasn't dealing with the dysfunctional family like we saw on Roseanne, The Simpsons and Married with Children. It's just too bad the networks didn't give it a chance to build an audience and bring in the people needed to tweak it. But then again, these same networks got all panicky and wanted to can shows like All in the Family, M*A*S*H, and Seinfeld because they weren't doing so good in their first few seasons. Big mistake on the networks part and the reason you see so many people watching more shows on networks like The Discovery Channel than are watching the major networks.",
