I am very glad I did, as I not only enjoyed the movie but STILL marvel at its special effects. Now this is a big surprise, as many great films of the 70s and 80s look very dated when it comes to special effects....mostly because CGI has been a huge game changer and older pre-computerized graphics often don't hold up when compared to it. But this is not the case here....it still looks lovely after many decades.\n\nBecause there are so many reviews for this one and it's pretty much considered a classic, I don't think I need to say much more. What was an excellent film is still an excellent film.",
