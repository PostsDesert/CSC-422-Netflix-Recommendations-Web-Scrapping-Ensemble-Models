With joy in their hearts they have to make sure that \"Frosty\" manages to get to a colder climate before he becomes nothing more than a puddle of water.\n\nThis is a true classic film utilizing the stars of the day. This is truly a film that can inspire children. Frosty the snowman is fairly simple and the voice acting is for par not really bad or really good. If there was a Christmas cartoon to show your kids this time of year this is probably my second favorite.",
