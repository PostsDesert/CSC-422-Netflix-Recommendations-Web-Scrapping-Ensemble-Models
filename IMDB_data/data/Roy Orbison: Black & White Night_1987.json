        "reviewBody": "The first great concert DVD I ever bought was this one. I use the word \"great\" for several reasons: 1 - the surround sound was (and may still be) the best I had ever heard on disc; 2 - the songs are all outstanding; 3 - the singers and musicians are fantastic; and, 4 - the beautiful black-and-white photography brings a nice touch.\n\nThis concert was a \"10,\" however, even on the VHS, which I stumbled on shortly after this was released and was grateful to have discovered. If you like old-fashioned rock 'n roll with updated instrumentals, this is about as good as it gets with (along with \"Carl Perkins' and Friends: Blue Suede Shoes\" DVD).\n\nThis is a fun, nostalgic feel--good disc, which always pleases and is outstanding, as mentioned to both see and hear. Why can't all music DVDs sound this good?\n\nOrbison does all his hit songs, and sings them well, with excellent backup from talented and famous musicians and singers. The black-and-white photography also is nicely done. The contrasts and shades are magnificent.\n\nOrbison's classic songs are embellished by Bruce Springsteen, T-Bone Burnett, Elvis Costello, Mike Utley, Tom Waits plus other lesser-known but very talented artists. Also, you get all- star male and female backup trios. The female backups are Bonnie Raitt, Jennifer Warnes and k.d. Lang - not bad, eh? Jackson Browne leads the male trio. There are a bunch of celebrities in the audience, too, ranging from Kris Kristofferson to Tiny Tim!\n\nMost of the times I get more pumped listening to the fast songs, although the slow ones are very good, too. The fast songs are fantastic, and the 5.1 sound is highlighted more on them as you hear different instruments come out of all five speakers - and they are distinct. On \"Pretty Wonan,\" you hear the three guitar players on three different speakers. It's amazing.\n\nEveryone on stage is having a super time. Just the look on Springsteen's face tells it all. These artists revered Orbison and it shows. You can just see how thrilled they were to be on stage with the legend. What a fantastic concert and DVD. Rating this 10 stars doesn't seem to be enough!",
