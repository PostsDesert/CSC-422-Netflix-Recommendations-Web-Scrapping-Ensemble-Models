        "reviewBody": "Well i suppose the story could have been interesting, but since there were amateurs involved through the whole movie; from the director to probably the craft service team, this movie shows it. Only thing that mattered was probably the breast shots here and there, otherwise, expect nothing but terrible acting, and badly chosen shots. I'm guessing this director is NOT a film-maker. I would even bet that the actors didn't even show up for their own premier, thats how bad this flick is. Embarrassed most likely, and would gladly erase this section of their lives. At a certain point in most movies , I suppose people go and use the restrooms, this probably never made it to theaters, so I was forced to chat with a telemarketer. I think I ended up buying some vacuum cleaner with super sucking power. I would have loved to break this DVD in a million pieces , and test the vacuum, since it was a rental, my super-sucking machine will have to wait.",
