Yeah, yeah, with the huge success of Survivor they thought that they could somewhat copy it with having ten people \"stranded\" in a house for a long period of time. Wrong! This is just plain awful.\n\nWhat exactly did they think was going to happen? Exciting that is. So these people are sitting around every night and we get to watch them. Wow, whoever thought of that idea was so intelligent.\n\nI probably saw a total of ten minutes of it. How I lasted that long is beyond me. I did catch the last episode of it though only because there was nothing else on. I couldn't help but laugh at the people who actually agreed to be stuck in that house just to win half a million dollars. Of course that is a nice chunk of change, but subjecting yourself to that humiliation is beyond money.\n\nThe network might have had a winner with Survivor, but Big Brother was just a joke. Do most of us a favor and please don't try to repeat this."
