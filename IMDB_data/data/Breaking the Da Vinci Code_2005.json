        "reviewBody": "As one interested in learning more about the historical accuracy of the claims of the Dan Brown's the Da Vinci Code, this documentary was very helpful. When I watched the documentary, I did not get the sense that the documentary was out to pose itself as neutral, but because the Da Vinci Code was not neutral to begin with, I felt this documentary was very informative and any biasness is inevitable. It helps to see this documentary when you are interested in learning about the historical accuracy of Dan Brown's powerful masterpiece but do not have the resources to purchase all the books about it. It talks about extra-biblical material that shows the great extent of the inaccuracy of SOME of Dan Brown's claims, material that can be verified, such as commentaries by art historians, records of Leonardo Da Vinci's work, a historically known hoax and research into if certain religious groups really built what they are portrayed as having built. Most helpful, the documentary involved comments from more than one author and scholar, but each with diverse backgrounds. Because of this, the audience gets a good exposure to a wide range of very specific and evidence-based points, rather than mere reaction from a rigidly Biblical perspective. It's a must-see and good investment to have in the library for those who want to know all sides of Dan Brown's claims.",
