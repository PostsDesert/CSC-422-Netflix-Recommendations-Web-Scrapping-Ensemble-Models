While the commercial fisherman shown lament the decline in catches over the last several decades (which is certainly not unique to New York) it's heartening to hear anecdotes from individuals who say that there are more fish than there were 30 years ago due to the cleaner water as a result of anti-pollution laws. My favorite sequence is of a man in waders fishing for stripers in a marsh surrounded by a highway, train tracks, and a golf course - it doesn't look like it's anywhere near NYC - he wouldn't let the director disclose his secret location."
