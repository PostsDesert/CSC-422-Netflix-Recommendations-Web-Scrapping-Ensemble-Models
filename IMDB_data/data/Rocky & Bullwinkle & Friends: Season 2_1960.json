        "reviewBody": "For this review, I'd like to go through all the Rocky movies (including the most recent Creed) and talk about their good points and their bad points. \n\nRocky - The first one is obviously a classic and the best out of the series and made people like Sylvester Stallone a superstar. It takes a simple but touching story of the underdog boxer and rise to have a chance to be a champion. \n\nRocky II - I felt was kind of the same story and was a little cheesy but it still carried the spirit of the original.\n\nRocky III - Like the second one, was cheesy but it was entertaining. But I like how Rocky was doing more boxing and had more drama and Mr. T was a good villain even though he talked too much. Also it featured a great song, \"Eye of the Tiger\".\n\nRocky IV - Again like the two other sequels, cheesy but still entertaining and it had another great song \"No Easy Way Out\". \n\nRocky V - I know this one disappointed a lot of fans but I thought it was okay but I can understand why people didn't like it but I don't think it deserves to be hated.\n\nRocky Balboa - Was redeeming and I like how it has a lot of references to the first Rocky. \n\nCreed - Finally, this one was another great comeback for Stallone as Rocky and gave Michael B. Jordan his big break as well. \n\nBut you can't beat the original because it's the first and a classic, like I said before. But I'm still looking forward to the sequel to Creed next year.",
