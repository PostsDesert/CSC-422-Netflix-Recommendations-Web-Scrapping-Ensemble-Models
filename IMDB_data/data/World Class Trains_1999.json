I have watched two or three seasons of this show, and they all disappoint in that respect. Too little time focused on the train and its operation, and too much time spent on side trips. When I go on a rail journey, I don't want to spent the night on a train that is parked on a siding, or worse be shunted off to a hotel. Sleeping on a moving train is half the fun. More details on the operation of the trains would be a plus, as well.\n\nAs a classically trained musician, I can say without fear of contradiction, that the background music on every of these programs is relentlessly annoying and intrusive. There's a lot to be said for silence.",
