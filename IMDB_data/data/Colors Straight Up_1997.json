It was shown to schools all over the world and aired on PBS. it's a must see!\n\nThe film follows the lives of 6 teens from South Central Los Angeles, as they struggle to make a future for themselves. The story lines are delicately interwoven with the stage play Watts Side Story that they are mounting. The story of the two inspirational teachers are very touching.\n\nThe film is shot Verite style, and was shot on location in Watts. It's astonishing to realize that the film is still alive, and unfortunately, the issues tackled in the film are still relevant.\n\nYou can find the film on Netflix.",
