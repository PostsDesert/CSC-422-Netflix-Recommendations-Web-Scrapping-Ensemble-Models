        "reviewBody": "In his fifth comedy special Andrew Dice Clay is still funny but the special still doesn't hit the heights of \"Dice Rules\" as the best Diceman special ever in my opinion, \"The Diceman Cometh\" You get a tad less than an hour of comedy after the lackluster boxing opening skit.His best jokes of course revolve around various sexual acts as well as making fun of selected audience members. Sadly a few 'topical' jokes makes this special somewhat dated. But it IS a good return to form after the lackluster \"For Ladies Only\" special.\n\nMy Grade: B \n\nEye Candy: a female audience member quickly flashes",
