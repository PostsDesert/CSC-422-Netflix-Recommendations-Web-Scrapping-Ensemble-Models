Instead it is merely a collection of Marky's home movies intercut with rare television appearances. There's no narative at all. About half way through, we decided to watch it with the optional commentary from Marky and Johnny. At least that gave it a little bit of clarity.\n\nAll in all, I don't think I would recommend this one to anyone other than a real die-hard completist Ramones fanatic.\n\nMike"
