I can't, but this is one, and it was such a delight to witness.\n\n Fantastic acting, very realistic slice of life, but not much of a storyline.\n\n I was disappointed to see that of the two big sex scenes in the movie, the homo one was over in a flash, and the het bonkathon, as usual, seemed to go on forever. Ah well, you can't have everything in a movie, I suppose.",
