Kyôko loses her baby and her fiancé winds up in a coma. Kyôko was cursed together with a television crew when they shot a show in the haunted house where Kayako was brutally murdered by her husband years ago. While each member of the team dies or disappears, Kyôko is informed that she has a three-and-a-half-month-old foetus in her womb.\n\nThe first Ju-on-The Grudge was the creepiest movie I have ever seen.\n\nIt scared me for two days,Just when you thought The Grudge couldn't get any scarier then Ju-on-The Grudge they bring the Spine-chilling Ju-on-The Grudge 2.\n\nThis is one hell of a scary movie, From the start to thr end you will be left confused by some scenes,\n\nthe more confusing it gets, the more it creeps you out!\n\nThis movie has some very creepy scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat but then the last ten minutes of the movie was just petrifying,\n\nit scared the living daylight out me! Acting from the whole cast was great!\n\nThis sequel was more creepy then the first movie but less scary then the first but It's one of the best horror sequel EVER! I give 9/10",
