Yes, the movie is predictable to the point that you new there would be a grab you ending, but I like expecting that and you never know who is at the door.\n\nThe characters all had their own querkyness about them that draws you, as we can all relate to one of them. I give this movie two thumbs up and suggest everyone sit down and enjoy a simple yet interesting movie.",
