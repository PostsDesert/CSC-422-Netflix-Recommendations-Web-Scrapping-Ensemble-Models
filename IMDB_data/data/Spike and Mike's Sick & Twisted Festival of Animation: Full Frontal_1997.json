        "reviewBody": "I love short films and short animations, so I really was expecting to enjoy this film far more than I did. That's because most of the animations weren't at all funny and they almost always relied on scatological humor or nudity. In a rare few cases, such as Bill Plympton's HOW TO MAKE LOVE TO A WOMAN, the crudity was necessary for the jokes and it worked well. In most cases, though, it was just potty humor that even 6th graders would find too juvenile to merit watching.\n\nIf you are looking for collections of short animations, I recommend you watch the ANIMATION SHOW DVDs. While many of the cartoons fall flat, far fewer do and you also don't need to feel ashamed if your kids decide to watch it with you. With this Spike and Mike collection, this definitely isn't the case!",
