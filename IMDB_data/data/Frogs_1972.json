        "reviewBody": "The 1970s was the era of disco, blaxploitation, and eco-horror (aka nature's vengeance). George McCowan's \"Frogs\" is considered the first eco-horror flick. A young Sam Elliott (more recently known as the narrator in \"The Big Lebowski\") plays a photographer who visits a southern estate where the patriarch (Ray Milland) refuses to live in harmony with nature. The old man sprays chemicals all over the swamp with absolutely no regard for the plants or animals. So it only makes sense that the frogs -- in collaboration with the snakes, alligators, spiders, etc. -- are out to dispense some justice! On the plot's value alone, there's no reason to interpret \"Frogs\" as any kind of high-quality movie. We could interpret it as a warning about messing with the Earth (when you battle nature, you ALWAYS lose), or we could just view it as a plain old fun movie. Whatever the case, it's a pretty enjoyable flick, silly though it may be.\n\nAll in all, just be a little more respectful the next time that you meet any plant or animal, especially an amphibian of the order Anura."
