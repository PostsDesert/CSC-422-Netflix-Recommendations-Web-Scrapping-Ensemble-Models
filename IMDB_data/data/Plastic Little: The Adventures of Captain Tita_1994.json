By chance, she saves Elysse Aldo Mordish, a young woman of her own age, from a rogue faction of Ietta's own military forces, led by the armored commander Guizel, who already killed Elysse's scientist father. As the military conducts a vicious chase for Elysse, it becomes apparent that she holds the key to a secret that could determine the fate of the entire planet's independence.\n\nPlastic Little is one of the greatest anime ever made. The storyline is thick, the character designs are just incredible and the backgrounds super amazing. It is a cunning, funny and original animated motion pic all the way.",
