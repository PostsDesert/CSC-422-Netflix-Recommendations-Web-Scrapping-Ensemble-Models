Her acting talents leave a lot to be desired, her Hindustani diction sucks and frankly I do not see her going places in films; at least films with any substance. Sanjay Dutt gives another wooden performance and Suniel Shetty bores with his mentally handicapped style and dialogue deliverance. Moraes does come across as a viable villain and is the most believable in this rather predictable and flat film on communication from the beyond. The most annoying feature of the DVD was the sound that jumped into deafening sound effects and then dropped to very low on dialogue. A horror film it is not. The only thing that made me jump was the sound effects which are jarring.",
