        "reviewBody": "This is quite a weak movie, with little focus. It's carried along mainly by its charismatic star and characteristic ethnic black humor. Adrienne Shelly, who wrote, stars, and directs, relies too much on her \"cute\" appeal and less on substance or content. It is what a Woody Allen film would have been if Allen were less of a genius. (I am inclined to write \"if Allen had been less of a genius,\" since unfortunately, based on Cancel Culture, we are likely to see the end of Allen's career, also due to his advanced age).\n\nThere are \"moments\" in the film, esoteric dialogue, but nothing beyond that. Much of the comedy is rather strained and must have been fashionably cynical for its time. But basically it's a one-woman show. If you like her you'll stick to the end, as I did; otherwise you might lose interest one-third of the way through, as I did.",
