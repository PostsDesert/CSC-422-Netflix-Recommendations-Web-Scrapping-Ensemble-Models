The other characters are shallow at best and leave the viewer unable to care about any of them. The plot line is average and, with a decent cast, would have raised my vote to average. The movie is characterized as being suspense but since the characters are so poorly acted, the viewer will probably hope that they all get killed before the film is over.\n\nI see that 11% of the votes were 10's which could only have been friends and relatives of the actors. Truly horrible acting.",
