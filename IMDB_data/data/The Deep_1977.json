        "reviewBody": "Reason number one is of course the opening wet t shirt sequence. Jacqueline Bisset's famous breasts are on ample display, but cannot maintain interest for 123 minutes of \"The Deep\". I would hate to see the extended 176 minute version, because scenes, especially underwater, are stretched way too long as is. Reason number two is the fight on the beach cliff elevator. This is certainly a unique contraption, and makes for an exciting and well photographed confrontation. Reason number three is Robert Tessier's battle with one of Lou Gossett's thugs. This is about as intense as it gets. Reason number four is if you ever wanted to see the top blown off a lighthouse, this is your movie. The slow motion explosion is amazingly shot. That's about it for \"The Deep\". The motives for all the treasure hunting mayhem are murky and the rushed underwater ending is disappointing. - MERK",
