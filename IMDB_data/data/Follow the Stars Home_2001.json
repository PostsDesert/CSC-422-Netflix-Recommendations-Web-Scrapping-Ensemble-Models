        "reviewBody": "A marvelous film despite the fact that there is so much going on. A doctor, who never married, should have married his sister-in-law. Instead, she is married to his brother, a nice guy who can't take tragic events. He couldn't visit his dying mother in the hospital when he was 12 and years later, he divorces his wife because she is about to give birth to a very sick child who will not last that long. (Supposedly).\n\nThe film shows how the mother and grandmother devoted 6 years to the child. A second plot in beautifully inter-connected with the main theme when an older child takes a summer job to help the mother care for the child. This young lady comes from a broken home, where the mother's boyfriend routinely abuses her mother and creates mayhem.\n\nImagine the mother taking the young girl to San Francisco to see a play and they're hit by a drunken driver. Her ex-husband comes to the hospital and has it out with his brother and there is some terrific scene in the end when it appeared that the couple would reconcile. This story ended extremely well.\n\nThis is definitely a story of triumph defeating adversity.It is extremely well acted. It's great to view despite the tragic circumstances involving all.",
