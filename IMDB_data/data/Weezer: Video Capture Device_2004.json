All those special features and rare footage are cool but I'd trade them in for a menu that just lists the videos and lets you play them. That's what I bought the thing for anyway. Oh well. Still worth it.\n\nI hope they come out with another one soon that has the post 2001 videos.\n\nAlso, if this was made in 2004 why couldn't they throw in the videos from 2001-2004? Oh Well. Still worth it.",
