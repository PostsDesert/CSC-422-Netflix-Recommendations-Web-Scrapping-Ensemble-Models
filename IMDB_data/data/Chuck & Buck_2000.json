I remember it being some of the best things I've watched. I decided to revisit the old show some 15 years after the first season aired and it still holds up. I remember watching episode 10, season 1 and No one's gonna love you by Band of Horses started playing, and for a moment, just a small moment my eyes started filling up with tears. I started to remember the good old days when I was a little kid watching this show, when things were much simpler.\n\nIt's safe to say this show still holds up and if you haven't watched it yet, I would highly recommend you do if you enjoy proper comedy/action!",
