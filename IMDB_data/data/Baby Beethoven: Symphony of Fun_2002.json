Its something that you can watch and listen to together or just get a few minutes for yourself. I did not think that my 4 month old sons would really watch or pay attention to anything on the TV but they did and they even started to get excited about watching it and started to baby talk and laugh along with baby Einstein baby Beethoven symphony of fun I think its great for all babies and their parents way to go Disney great DVD! I want to buy the whole collection and plan on giving baby Einstein DVD's and products as gifts at baby showers from now on. The only down for me was motion sickness but I get that from almost everything that is not steady or still, no matter what I love these movies!",
