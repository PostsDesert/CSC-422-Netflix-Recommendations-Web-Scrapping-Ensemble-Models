        "reviewBody": "\"RoboCop 2\" , the sequel to 1987's ultra-violent \"RoboCop\", is not quite up to par with its predecessor. The film still manages to entertain on a large level. I know that a lot of people do not like this movie, but I personally think it is still pretty good. I'm not writing a review of this movie, I am just expressing my thoughts on it.\n\nFirst off, this movie is a lot more violent than the first \"RoboCop\". You get scenes of bloody shootings, grisly scenes of torture, and a surgery which I'd rather let you see for yourself than describe here. Paul Verhoeven does not return to shock his audience with graphic violence and ultra dark humor, which has since become trademark in his films. The director this time is Irvin Kershner, who made \"The Empire Strikes Back\" nearly ten years before this movie. Kershner seems to focus a lot more on action, rather than story. \n\nSecond, the movie's villain, Cain (Tom Noonan), to me is a direct opposite of Clarence Boddicker (the villain from the first film who was played by Kurtwood Smith). Cain enjoys giving people pleasure (through his highly addictive designer drug called Nuke) while Boddicker was a sadist who took pleasure in the death and suffering of others. (Though after Cain's \"transformation\", none of this really matters). \n\nLastly, this movie does not exploit children. The kid in this movie, Hob (played by Garbriel Damon) is Cain's twelve year-old side kick. He is a violent, foul-mouthed little child who runs errands for Cain. The writers for this movie did this intentionally, to show that crime holds no age barrier. Regardless of age, crime is crime. \n\nLike I said, \"RoboCop 2\" is not trying to be better than its predecessor, it's just trying to be something different.\n\n8/10",
