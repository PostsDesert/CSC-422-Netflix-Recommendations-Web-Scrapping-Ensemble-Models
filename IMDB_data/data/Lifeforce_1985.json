        "reviewBody": "The Cannon Group has always seemed like the movie studio equivalent of the engine that tried and tried to climb that mountain, but unlike it's children's book counterpart, never seemed to reach the top.\n\n\"Lifeforce\" is the exception.\n\nIn fact as space-vampire-movies go, this is the best, which of course on the subject of space-vampires... isn't saying much. But \"Lifeforce\" really is a memorable ride.\n\nFrom the director of \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" and \"Poltergeist\" comes this massive apocalyptic science-fiction and horror epic. It's \"2001\" and \"Dawn of the Dead\" all rolled into one juicy little egg-roll of a movie, spiced with the beautiful naked body of Mathilda May (if she's smart she would start mathildamay.com and sell signed \"Lifeforce\"-pictures, and make a fortune of perverts like me). It's scripted by none other than Dan O'Bannon (Alien, Return of the Living Dead, Total Recall) and the cast is great. Frank Finlay looks like Peter Cushing's second cousin just escaped from a Hammer Horror movie, and it's always nice to see Michael Gothard (God rest his soul) who played creepy Emile Locque in \"For Your Eyes Only\". Steve Railsback is good as always, and Peter Firth perfectly fits the part of the SAS-colonel who must save the day (he always reminds me of the 1980's 'Doctor Who' Colin Baker :)\n\nThe 25 million dollar budget looks like 50 million dollars, the f/x are first-rate but best of all: a rousing score by Henry Mancini! His \"Lifeforce\"-theme should deservedly rank with the all-time great sci-fi-themes. It's almost hard to fathom that the composer of \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" and \"The Pink Panther\"-movies, so known for his romantic music, should actually be able to produce such a bombastic score. It's like he kept it all in for 30 years and then suddenly decided to blow it all off on the soundtrack of this movie, and nobody needs to clean up after him - it's that brilliant!\n\nWhen history is to be counted, this is one of the movies the Cannon Group will be remembered for, together with \"Bloodsport\", \"52 Pick-Up\", \"Hanoi Hilton\" and \"Missing in Action\" (come on, Chuck ruled as Braddock). And it only took 60 or so movies to create five good ones :)",
