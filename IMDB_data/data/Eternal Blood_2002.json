I really enjoyed this Spanish-version vampire film as it's was done not in a style reminscent of American,Asian,or European horror films that we've all seen before. Juan Olgade is a very good actor and a drop-dead lookalike of Robert Downey jr. The version I saw was unrated and very gory and I apperciate the ending where dumb people will go \"Huh\" and those of us who actually paid attention will be like where there's 2 ways to explain whether or not they were vampires at all? Very good foregin horror film compared to others that I've seen. ** out of *****"
