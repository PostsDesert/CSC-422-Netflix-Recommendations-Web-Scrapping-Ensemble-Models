If anyone enjoys Dismey movies and/or anything light-hearted and musical...this is a must-see!\n\nThe main character, of course appeared later in \"West Side Story\". He is a fabulous dancer. I'd be afraid to do some of the stunts he did in this film.\n\nAlso, this film was critically acclaimed for the special effects of this time period.\n\nIf your children(or you, for that matter) enjoy fairy tales, movies taken from fairy tales. Or, maybe just a little family fun...give this one a try",
