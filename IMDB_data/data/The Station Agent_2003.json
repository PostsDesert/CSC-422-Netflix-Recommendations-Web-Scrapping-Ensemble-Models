        "reviewBody": "The Station Agent is a movie about friendship and disability. I don't mean the obvious, but the the underlying fact that we all have a disability of some shape or fashion and that sometimes draws people together and can make for satisfying friendships when those disabilities are cast aside.\n\nPeter Dinklage is outstanding as Finbar McBride, who inherited a train station and just wanted to hide. Unfortunately, or fortunately, Joe (Bobby Cannavale) is the irritatingly persistent sort that is looking for friendship and cracks the shell that Fin is trying to use to protect himself. They hook up with Olivia (Patricia Clarkson), who is hiding after the death of her son.\n\nThe three become friends and help each other through life's difficulties. Three outstanding performances that will have you assessing your relationships in a new light.",
