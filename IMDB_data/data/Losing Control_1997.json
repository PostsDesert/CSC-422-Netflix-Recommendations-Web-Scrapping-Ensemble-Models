        "reviewBody": "All in all, this wasn't a bad flick for the soft-core genre. The acting was not great, but better than most movies of the this ilk. It tried to stake itself in believability, but lost its credence about halfway in when the novelist heroine kept putting herself in crazier and crazier situations.\n\n Still, the movie was involving and featured some great sex. Usually, movies in this genre overlay some loud score over every scene, which while sugar-coating it, takes away much of the titillation. Not so in \"Losing Control\". You can hear everything during the passionate scenes, and it really adds a lot to the movie. Not a bad rental for you and a significant other if you are looking to generate some heat."
