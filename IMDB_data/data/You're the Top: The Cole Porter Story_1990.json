        "reviewBody": "I can't believe the low score! If you want a three-dimensional portrait of Cole Porter, then this is the best source. We see archival footage and photos that cover Porter's personal life as well as his career. From Kitty Carlyle Hart to Brendan Gill to Bobby Short, friends, family, critics and fellow artists provide invaluable insights into the man, how he grew up, worked and played, particularly his sexuality, which neither of the Hollywood biopics has had the guts to explore frankly. Furthermore, this video skillfully evokes a world where elegance and wit were cultural norm, where someone like Cole Porter could thrive. Alas, thanks to the mediocritizing influence of television and pop culture, that time has long gone. Those who do not care for or do not understand You're the Top say more about themselves than about this fine biography.",
