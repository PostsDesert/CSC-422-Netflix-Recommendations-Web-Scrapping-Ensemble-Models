        "reviewBody": "Not quite a great film, but an entertainingly odd and unique one. Full of rough violence and noir situations, but played mostly as very dark comedy.\n\nAlec Baldwin is very good indeed as a killer sociopath who somehow is also very likable when he's not robbing and beating people. Fred Ward is terrific as the scraggly cat of a cop who chases Baldwin down after Baldwin steals his badge, gun and false teeth, and starts to run around pretending to be a cop himself. And Jennifer Jason Leigh underplays to great effect as a pretty, dumb hooker, who falls for Baldwin, and doesn't figure out just what kind of dangerous, crazy guy he is until very late in the game. \n\nThat said, it doesn't add up to a lot emotionally, Leigh's role is underwritten, and there are several gaping logic holes the film just ignores (Ward has dinner early on with Baldwin and Leigh, clearly knows he's a criminal, but just leaves?!?)\n\nBut - those flaws noted - I've seen it twice, and fully enjoyed myself both times.",
