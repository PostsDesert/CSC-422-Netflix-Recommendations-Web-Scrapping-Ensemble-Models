Since no one says there's been a power shutdown or a blackout, all we can surmise is that either the victims forgot to pay their electric bills, or the FBI fails to train its agents in the use of a handy device found on the walls of all the fancier houses -- a light switch -- in order to see what they're doing. They must miss a lot of evidence that way.\n\nBut, hey, this is a movie in which you hear the following dialog:\n\n\"All I know is, the (investigation) went deep.\"\n\n\"How deep?\"\n\n\"All the way to the top.\""
