        "reviewBody": "Prime Suspect's star, Helen Mirren, was indeed irreplaceable. In Errors of Judgment, on the verge of retirement, Jane (Mirren) approaches the case of a missing teenager, which she refuses to abandon until the killer is brought to justice. Simultaneously stricken by personal problems, including her father's illness and her alcoholism, Jane is eventually drawn to a young girl pivot of the case, a smart and fiercely independent sort that reminds her of herself. The story line, as usually, was great. Phil Davies did an excellent job directing, which continued the style employed by Tom Hooper in the previous episodes. Prime Suspect was a TV series that both renewed the post-modern crime series and unfortunately fed the commonplace, undignified sex & violence elements that plague it nowadays.",
