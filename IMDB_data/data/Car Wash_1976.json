It also served as a blueprint for many other primarily black-cast comedies to come. When writing 1997's \"Friday,\" Ice Cube was quoted as saying he wanted to create a fun film just like \"Car Wash.\" Many funny scenes, some in questionable taste, but still harmless enough. For those who lived through the period, it'll bring back some memories."
