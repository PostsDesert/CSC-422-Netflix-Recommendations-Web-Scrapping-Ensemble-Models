But after a few times of seeing the show (I have a 3-year-old) the horror and disgust will wear off, and it'll even make a margin of sense to me. Sometimes a show will actually grow on me. With Jay Jay--NOT THE CASE. This show doesn't even have a subtle charm beneath the annoying icky voices of the characters and artificial happiness. It is cheesy beyond cheesy, and the faces are creepy. And that helicopter (herkey) must roll every R, and it is like nails scraping a chalk board. I don't know why kids like this show, but it's not one of those that can be easily tolerated by the adult in the child's life who gets stuck watching it right along with him. If I had to choose one word to describe this show, it would be GROSS."
