This seems to be an attempt at that and for the most part it works. I can't say I'm very familiar with Adam Baldwin (is he a Baldwin brother?) but he seemed to do a good job with his part. And I was surprised to see Elizabeth Berkeley actually get to act for a change and not just take off her clothes. I guess they didn't have a very big budget because it isn't really about action as much as figuring out what's going on. There's a nice twist about midway into it that caught me totally by surprise. Also an interesting ending that - gasp! - tries to say something.",
