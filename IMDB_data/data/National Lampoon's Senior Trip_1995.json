Some raunchy and gross and stupid jokes.\n\nThis movie was pretty fun to watch when that is what you want to see. I really loved some of the characters they had in the show and I was pleasantly surprised that I ended up enjoying this TV movie and laughing at so much of it, pretty much I enjoyed the movie and jokes all the way through.\n\nIt's not like most National Lampoons movies now which have gotten really bad it's almost as funny as the old stuff they did back when the brand name was really respected and funny."
