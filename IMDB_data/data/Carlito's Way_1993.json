        "reviewBody": "Right well I can say this is one of my favourite gangster films ever, and I truly regard it almost as highly as good fellas or the godfather.\n\nThis is simply because of the way the story catches you. Pacino delivers an excellent performance (do you really expect any less from him?) as the main guy Carlito who just wants out of the whole gangster game. By his side is the almost unrecognisable Sean Penn. An afro wearing cocaine addict who just seems determined to lure Carlito back into the kind of world he is trying to leave.\n\nThis film is easy to enjoy with a great story and a great cast. And if you look carefully enough you can see a young Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn from lord of the rings in case you don't know) as a crippled low life. Made me chuckle.\n\nAnyways, i give this movie 10/10",
