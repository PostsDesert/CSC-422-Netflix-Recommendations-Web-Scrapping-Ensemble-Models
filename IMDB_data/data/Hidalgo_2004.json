I said \"touching\" in the meaning that something in it - humour, breathtaking adventures, worth of respect friendship of man and horse, magic of arabian desert and idea of will, both human and animal, that is the reason for success - all these are mixed in unique brew, called \"Hidalgo\". I would recommend this movie to all people of all ages, whose hearts are still alive and able to sympathize. Take your kids or go alone - anyway manage somehow to watch this movie. It is so pure and mood lifting,so I can compare it in its influence on viewer only with \"Big Fish\". I'm not a critic and I won't talk about \"actors' play, plot\", etc etc etc. I'm just telling about my own experience and feelings that this movie put in me. Wish you the same good movie-evening :)))"
