        "reviewBody": "First, this is a nice-looking film with a good DVD transfer. Seeing an early '50s sci-fi film Technicolor is nice. \n\nAlso, having just watched - I'm not kidding - \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" and \"Invaders From Mars,\" this George Pal film looked like multi-million dollar Oscar winner in comparison. Except for the ending scene, the special-effects were passable, the acting was good and the dialog pretty realistic. The story plausible? Of course not, but what they did know of space travel in 1951? Hell, we didn't send a man on the moon until almost 20 years after this movie. No, this is not one of those popcorn flicks that \"is so bad, it's good\" or just plaint stink. No, this movie is just good......period....even today, almost 57 years later!.\n\nThis was a no-nonsense survival story without an overdone corny romance, no stupid or obnoxious kids nor goofy-looking adults. It had a solid reverence for God and to science at the same time, a realistic portrayal of people under stress and how they would react knowing their world was coming to end. For a mostly talky film, it moved fast with few, if any lulls.\n\nJohn Hoyt, who plays the wheelchair-bound millionaire \"Sydney Stanton,\" may not be a \"name\" actor but he's very good. Check his resume: it's awesome. The man was in about every good television show for decades. The man could act. So did the rest of this cast.\n\nOverall, this \"modern\" Noah's Ark story was a good one, and far, far better than your normal sci-fi flicks from the time period. Well done!",
