        "reviewBody": "This movie was too amazing to be down-sized by a couple of words. When I heard about this movie, I was very anxious to see it. I watched Brooke Ellison on Larry King a few days later, and I thought she was such an amazing person. The cast of this movie was outstanding. I forgot that I was watching a movie, I felt like it was the real thing. Christopher Reeve shone as a director, and no one will question his talent or work, the movie speaks for itself. I think this was just amazing and incredible. In the movie, Brooke Ellison's mother, Jean, told Brooke, \"You can either contribute to this world or be paralyzed. The choice is yours.\" Brooke Ellison decided to contribute to this world, despite her disabilities, and I am sure she has inspired many people with spinal-cord injuries to make something of themselves. Brooke Ellison even inspires those of us without injuries to be the best we can be and Brooke's Story teaches us that we can't be paralyzed by the small things in life. We must keep going and enduring the pain while we continue on life's journey. Because, tragedy or triumph, pain or sadness, life is going to continue. Brooke Ellison is the type of person who proves how strong women are. The story also does a wonderful job of proving how strong a family can be. Brooke's accident could have easily torn her family apart, but they stayed together and grew closer than ever. With unconditional love and support from her family, and the undeniable love her mother, Brooke Ellison was able to go to Harvard and graduate summa cum laude from Harvard University, a huge challenge for anyone, disability or not. I wish Brooke Ellison the best of luck and I recommend that everyone watch The Brooke Ellison Story. *Christopher Reeve will be missed but he accomplished life's purpose, he spent live working to have something that would outlast it.*"
