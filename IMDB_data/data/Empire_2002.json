There was nothing about this film that was beyond merely \"okay\". The music wasn't even that great, nor was the acting. Leguizamo was more entertaining doing his voice-over in Ice Age! Seriously, folks. Additionally, the movie was so predictable I found it difficult to keep from falling asleep. But if you feel you MUST see this movie, you would be wise to wait for the video/DVD release."
