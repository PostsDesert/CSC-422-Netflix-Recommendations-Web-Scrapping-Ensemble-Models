        "reviewBody": "The main theme is the contrast between the unemotional stiff male Ratko and the brisk expressive Suzana. It is true that the unorganised setting have references to the Balkan filmmaker Kusturica. Yet in my understanding Ratko is modelled on the roles in films by the Finnish director Aki Kaurismäki. The use of elementary colours are important for both Koljevic and Kaurismäki, e.g. in this film, the bright red truck. There is a contrast between a chaotic situation (war, ex con, stolen truck) on one hand and at the other hand Ratko's unemotional attitude and the elementary colours. In a way the contrast between Suzana and Ratko corresponds to the contrast between the external chaos and Ratko's simplicity. Ratkos calm comes from within himself and not from the exterior situation. In the film there is some action that is provided by the truck odyssey. Yet, the film is a still life picture since no real changes take place.",
