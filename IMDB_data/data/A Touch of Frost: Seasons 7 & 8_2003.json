David Jason doesn't play some part, he makes us believe he really is that scruffy, grumpy, funny little guy who happens to be one of the best inspectors at Denton CID (I don't know where Denton is, somewhere in England I suppose). Sometimes the plots may not be not perfectly credible, but the way they are written make the audience start guessing \"whodunit\" and most of the time you're dead wrong or hardly close to the right solution. It's possible that a real police officer would think that the Frost character is not credible enough, but I'm not a police officer and I'm buying it, the whole lot of it. This is fine entertainment by some of the finest Britisch actors alive. May there be many more seasons of this."
