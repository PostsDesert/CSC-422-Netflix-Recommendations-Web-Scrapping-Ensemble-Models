        "reviewBody": "The Desert Rats is an unpretentious war film that tells a good story with economy. The heroics come without drum-rolls.\n\nThe most fascinating part of this film is to watch both the marvelous Robert Newton and the under-rated James Mason give Richard Burton acting lessons.\n\nBurton tends to chew the scenery when he snarls, \"Good-morning,\" as though he were the youngest in a large family, doing anything for attention.\n\nNewton counters Burton's unnecessary histrionics with a beautifully modulated realization of-himself in disguise as Prof. Bartlett, Burton's old instructor. I think this is the most honest look at the REAL Newton on film. The rueful man who clearly understands his inability to stay sober, but still has enough control to see his own and everyone else's situation clearly. He is the kind, timorous, brilliant failure who, in one burst of glory, up-stages his more successful juniors. Newton delivers a truly magical performance.\n\nJames Mason also delivers a balanced and multi-layered Rommel. Of course he practiced playing this brilliant German General in the better-known film, The Desert Fox.\n\nBurton comes across as pure ham in The Desert Rats, but there IS one scene he has where he is honest and effective. He explains to Bartlett that the picture of the young woman in his wallet is his wife. The picture actually IS Burton's wife, pre-Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nOtherwise, although Burton is billed as the star, the film belongs to Newton and Mason. See it for the pleasure of their company."
