It was always funny to watch, and the time would just seem to fly by when watching an episode. I was sorry to see it leave the air, but at the same time it had a respectable run. Any longer, and it would have been played out, and lose it's humour. I hope Steve Harvey keeps in the TV business or makes movies, because he is a real comedic force to be reckoned with!"
