No one but James Caan could have pulled off the role of Jolly as he did. He's entertaining, light-hearted, and gets his point across in a rather different way. This movie is one of my all time favorites. I especially love the way Jolly helps Kay to get hold of her life and move on. Very entertaining! Worth the watch."
