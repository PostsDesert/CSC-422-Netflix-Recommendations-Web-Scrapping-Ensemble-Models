Not just Tibet but any other news they don't want people to see, they will block it. Many people in China would not agree with this movie because they have been taught differently. Text books here are completely wrong. I also see how minority groups (Tibetan, Naxi, Mongol and so on) are treated as second class citizens. The only time they are not treated this way is when the Chinese (Han) can make money off them through tourism. People belonging to minority groups are restricted in travel (not able to hold a passport and only allowed to go to certain areas) so that their horror stories can be contained. In the far west of China, there have been bus bombings and demonstrations for independence but news of this is hard to get out because cameras and videos are confiscated. It is not even reported on local news.\n\nThis is a great movie and long live the Dalai Lama."
