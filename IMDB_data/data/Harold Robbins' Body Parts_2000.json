Why did he accept a movie like this?\n\nThe story is anemic, the actors are bad and the photography is bland. There's even the scene where Joyce Jimenez was shown with her body cut in half because the villains sell body organs for a living. Yuck!!\n\nI think \"Vital Parts\" suck in every way. 3/10 rating",
