        "reviewBody": "I am a fan of Larry David, both of SEINFELD and his brilliant recent HBO special he starred in, but this is an utter disaster. A script that never should have been filmed. The main plot of money coming between cousins quickly grows tired (maybe this was a plot for a Seinfeld that never got used where George would give Kramer two quarters that he uses to hit a jackpot - might work in a twenty two minute sitcom, but not a feature film) Everyone is miscast 9even the usually steady Stephen Webber. Craig Bierko is awful, mugging and aping like Kramer's stand-in.) The character of the Jewish mother is such a cartoon and so one note. There are maybe three good jokes in the whole thing. The movie plays out like a car wreck - you find you can't look away because of the slim hope you might find a survivor!"
