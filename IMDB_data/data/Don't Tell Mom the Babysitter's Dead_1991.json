        "reviewBody": "Just saw it again; the cast carries a silly plot, in much the same way as a '40s screwball comedy but with an 80s/90s sensibility and awareness. Applegate and Coogan are really outstanding here, and the supporting cast is smart enough to either support or stay out of the way, as necessary. It's pure humor with no big message, which apparently was a virtue 60 years ago but is unforgivable now. I'd best describe the humor as, \"Hilarity ensues as fish out of water learn to breathe air.\" \n\nI'd give it a very solid 6.8 out of 10, worth a rental or a Netflix hit, but not a $20 purchase.\n\nTom"
