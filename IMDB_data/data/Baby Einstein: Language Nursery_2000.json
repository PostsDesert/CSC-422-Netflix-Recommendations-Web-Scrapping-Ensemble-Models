        "reviewBody": "As a new mother I am always on the lookout for ways to improve my babies life and I had heard a lot about the Baby Einstein range of DVD's. I think this title, 'Language Nursery' is one of the older ones but considering my baby has not seen any of them I don't think this really mattered. \n\nWhen we put the DVD on I must admit that I thought there was a problem with the sound until I realised that the voices were speaking in different languages on purpose! There were some nice but basic images for my son to look at but it was the words I could not get my head around. \n\nAt 6 months old my son can just about manage a few gurgles let alone anything that resembles an actual word. He is bobarded with adult voices all day (in English) which I imagine is confusing enough so I just didn't understand why you would want to make it even more difficult by adding a million other languages to the equation. Did anyone else feel this?\n\nAnyway he did not seem too interested in the visuals and after about 10 minutes or so we switched it off. We did try a few more times to watch it but he was not a fan. Oh well, will try another one of the range, there's sure to be one he likes as everyone else seems to!",
