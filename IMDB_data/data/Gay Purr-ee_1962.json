And I love movies that are set in Paris, like the musical \"An American in Paris\" starring Gene Kelly and also the Pixar animated film \"Ratatouille.\" One last thing to say is that I am a cat lover, as I have said many times.\n\nJudy did a wonderful job as Mewsette, both in speaking and singing for her. And Chuck Jones did an excellent job with the production and animation of the film; Chuck Jones is one of my favorite animators. So overall, this film is an excellent piece of animation. It is colorful and beautifully animated, with songs you will remember and love.",
