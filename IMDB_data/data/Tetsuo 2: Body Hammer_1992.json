This one is less experimental with a more traditional storytelling. It is visible the movement to give a clear plot, which seems not reasonable because this style of movie is just for cult followers, anime fans or people interested in Japanese underground cinema. The same ones who would watch it with or without a clear plot.\n\nSummarizing: The first movie was shocking and disturbing. This one is just eccentric when compared with its predecessor. Not recommended for normal audiences, maybe for anime fans. Think this movie as an anime. It is easier to enjoy it.",
