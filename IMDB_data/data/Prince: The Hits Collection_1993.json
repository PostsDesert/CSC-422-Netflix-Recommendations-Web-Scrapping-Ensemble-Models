You won't find here pieces like \"Purple Rain\" or \"When doves cry\", but still it's very good, representative choice of his videos. Sound & vision for songs like \"Kiss\", \"Little Red Corvette\" and \"Raspberry Beret\" - what more would any Prince's fan desire? Also, You can find here things like \"Controversy\", \"Cream\" or \"Peach\", which are forgotten in most of the TV stations. The only thing that would be better is the full compilation of singles by the artist, but it's not that simple, as You know. So..., just sit back and enjoy! The one and only, he doesn't wanna be king,)",
