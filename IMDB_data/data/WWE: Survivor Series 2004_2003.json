        "reviewBody": "Just another PPV in my opinion. \n\nMatch one saw Spike Dudley defending the worthless Cruiserweight championship against Chavo Guerrero, Kidman and Rey Mysterio in a very good match. Next up Shelton Benjamin puts his Intercontinental championship on the line against Christian in a very good match as well.\n\nThen Kurt Angle, Luther Reigns, Mark Jindrak and Carlio Caribbean Cool with Jesus in his corner try to defeat John Cena, Eddie Guerrero, RVD and Big Show. This was poor, why Cena even bothered coming to the ring I don't know, because all he done was brawl with Jesus and gave Kurt Angle the F-U. Understandably Carlito couldn't wrestle because of his injured shoulder, but this was terrible!\n\nNext up another pointless match takes place, when Lita takes on Trish Stratus. There were no wrestling moves in this match up folks, just Lita beating up Trish, in a terrible brawl. Things get worse yet again as The Undertaker takes on Heidenreich in a 17 minute bore. Then JBL defends his WWE title against Booker T in another boring match (this was all Booker T)\n\nBut light relief comes in the form of the main event. Triple H, Edge, Gene Skitsky and Batista take on Randy Orton, Maven, Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit in an enjoyable main event. Benoit got eliminated first which p*ssed me off. Earlier on while The Coach was interviewing Maven, Snitsky attacked him, so the match only started with 3 on 4. Maven then came down to help Orton and Jericho, but was smashed in the head with a chair by Snitsky. One good highlight was when Edge tagged both HHH and Snitksy in at the same time. HHH shoved Snitsky and Snitksy pushed HHH over. Batista made the save when he confronted Snitsky. Enjoyable! Orton won when he nailed HHH with an RKO from no where.!\n\nFatal 4 way - 7/10 Benjamin vs Christian - 8/10 Smackdown! elimination match - 4.5/10 Lita vs Trish - 2/10 Booker T vs JBL - 5/'0 Taker vs Heidenreich - 3.5/10 Raw elimination match - 8.5/10",
