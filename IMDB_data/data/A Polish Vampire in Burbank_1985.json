You can actually order this movie directly from the company (Pirromount Pictures) for about $19.99.\n\nIs it perfect? No, but it's the most fun you'll have watching something put together on a less-than-shoestring budget. There are some really funny scenes in here, and some classic lines. In my opinion, it's better than anything Troma ever released.\n\n8/10.",
