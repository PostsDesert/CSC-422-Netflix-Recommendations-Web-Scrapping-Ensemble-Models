        "reviewBody": "This movie is so bad it's hilarious. Leslie Neilsen plays a guy who's so annoying and obnoxious that it's hard to believe it's meant to be a serious role. His hilarious performance is worth renting the movie. There's a lot of great one-liners from his character. Christopher George is his usual no-nonsense macho self, Andrew Stevens is great, there's a lot of pretty women, and Ruth Roman is great in the Shelley Winters role of the increasingly hysterical mom. A very seventies-type movie, and very funny. I loved the nature theme, and there's a lot of great action scenes. I love the rats who come flying at the sheriff for no apparent reason. Highly Recommended!"
