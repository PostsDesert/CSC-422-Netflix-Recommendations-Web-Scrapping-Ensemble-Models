Jason and Michelle are left at Grandmother's house while Mom and Dad take a small vacation. Bored beyond belief, Jason and Michelle discover the attic and some interesting souvenirs. Among them are 4 penguin figurines that Grandfather gave Grandmother on their honeymoon trip to the Falkland Islands. Jason also discovers a toy spaceship and the Penguins become it's crew. Imagination takes over and many adventures follow. Funny references to Star Trek, Science Fiction and popular culture while being educational for the kids.",
