Unfortunately, the pets get stranded at the airport and find themselves running wild all over the city of San Francisco, befriending (as well as making enemies with) street dogs who distrust humans, eluding greedy dogcatchers, and trying desperately to make it home safely to their owners. Amusing and well-intended, this sequel has lots more vocal talents, hilarious wisecracks, and impressive Bay Area scenery, but the story is strained and lacks the heart, joy, and sheer entertainment value of its predecessor. **Â½"
