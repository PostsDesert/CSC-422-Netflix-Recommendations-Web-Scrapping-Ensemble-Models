It has a boring, drawn out, inscrutable beginning that makes it hard to bother continuing to watch it at all.\n\nI suppose it is someone's idea of cinema verit√©. It has all the amateurish production values of The Blair Witch Project but with none of the suspense.\n\nThere is no ending to speak of at all . . . yet I was glad to see it end. Truth is, being a die-hard, I set my DVD player at 1.5X speed about half way through . . . just to see my evening of pain end all the more quickly.\n\nA complete waste of time.\n\nWho makes this stuff?"
