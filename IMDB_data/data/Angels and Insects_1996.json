Or have you ever watched ants clean up a carcass of roadkill. Angels and Insects has some of the most beautiful costumes I've ever seen, but one of the most shocking stories. Will Adamson as Mark is very subdued,as Kristin Scott Thomas remarkable as Matty- who proves to be the real beauty.\n\nI like how the director kept giving us subtle hints and then was not afraid to throw the truth in our faces- like being hit by the bucket of ice water. A.S. Byatt's story is well translated into film .",

        "description": "After ten years on the Amazon and surviving a shipwreck in which most of his work is lost, naturalist William Adamson, now lacking a home and means of his own, is taken in by his benefactor, Sir Harald Alabaster, who hires William to assist him with the writing of a book, as well as to tutor the younger of the children in residence on his estate. It's good fortune for William, who finds satisfaction in his work, as well as in making the acquaintance of one of Sir Harald's daughters, Eugenia, with whom he quickly becomes enamored. Eugenia, however, is a rather fragile flower, struggling with the inner demons of a dark secret born of unspeakable desires. Despite his best efforts, the shadows that plague Eugenia's soul remain. William, though, is determined to break through her darkness and bring her into the light, but some secrets are better left buried; and before it's over, William may discover more tragedy than he imagined.",
