Reminded me of early Abel Ferrara (Ms. 45), Wes Craven (Last House on the Left) or even John Cassavetes (Killing of a Chinese Bookie). The basic story involves a young woman (Deborah Twiss), new to NYC, that is saved from being raped by a feminist vigilante gang. The guerillas take her in and give her a job at their front business, a divey strip club, and introduce her to their night-time revenge raids. It gets pretty intense and twisted from there. Political, creepy and sexy. See this if you get the chance, because I don't think it'll make it to your local Blockbusters.",
