While Hollywood is still doing musicals stuck in earlier eras (clearly just trying to emulate the musicals of the 40s and 50s), Bollywood has apparently picked up the torch and carried on.\n\nThis film is sensitive, endearing, and doesn't have to be an accomplishment of modern cinema to be so. It is reviving an genre that I thought was lost forever (the classic musical) for me. It is worthy of Fred Estere.",
