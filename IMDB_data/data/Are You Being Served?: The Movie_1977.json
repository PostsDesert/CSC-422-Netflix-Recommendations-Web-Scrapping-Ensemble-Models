        "reviewBody": "This big screen outing of Are You Being Served is not as loved as the series is but it still features the original (and by far the best) cast at the top of their game and features lots of laugh out loud moments.\n\nThe film struggles to adapt with not having the laughter track behind and the jokes are left hanging because of it. Without it the piece doesn't flow as it could which is a shame because the jokes do come thick and fast.\n\nAlso some routines that have previously been used in the series are recycled but they are worth another viewing because they are so good.\n\nOverall a good rarely seen film that is well worth a look for those who already know the series and for those just discovering it.",
