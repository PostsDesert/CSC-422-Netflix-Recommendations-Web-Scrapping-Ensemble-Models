This movie was so boring, and so pointless. It had no plot or story that I remember.\n\nBy the time the movie ended I could hardly keep my head up. Nearing the end of the movie I was yawning and almost ready to fall asleep. My friend asked me if I wanted to leave the theater and I said \"no let's wait until the end.\" I'm sorry I waited so long to leave.\n\nDon't waste your time with this movie because I'm sorry I didn't get out of the theater when I had the chance to."
