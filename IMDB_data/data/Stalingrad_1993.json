        "reviewBody": "Absorbing, horrendous descent into the nightmare of combat. Focusing on the invading German army (into the Soviet Union) in the second world war, the impact no less awful. These men are enlisted men, who had no more control over their government's criminal actions, than US troops had over their government during the Vietnam War. Or any government sending their military in any war, for that matter. To assume they could belies a certain lack of acquaintance or experience, with the structure of a military organization.\n\nThese men are trapped like rats, and survival at any cost, to preserve ones life is paramount. Politics and lofty notions fly out the window, as the veneer of civilized behavior is stripped off.\n\nSTALINGRAD is gripping, grotesque, poignant and pitiful in its graphic presentation of war time experience. Highly recommended.",
