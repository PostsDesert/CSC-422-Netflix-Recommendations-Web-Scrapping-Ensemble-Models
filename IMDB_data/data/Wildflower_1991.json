She convincingly played a cute and curious little girl, which compelled me to see her future projects.\n\nI was only about 11 or 12 when I saw this film on TV. I watched it several times, though, because my mom taped it. I didn't quite understand WHY I liked the movie so much, except that the actors all have great chemistry. Though I must've felt it then, I was too young to realize the deeply sensual and subtle eroticism the plot rested on. It is also nonetheless a very heartfelt and coming-of-age film."
