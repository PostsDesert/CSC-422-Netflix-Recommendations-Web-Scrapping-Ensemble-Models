Dont rent or buy this...they destroy their own songs....the best sounding song out of all of em is \"Nowhere Man\" which is a Beatles song...pure crap. George Lynch isnt even playing an acoustic..and Mick Brown is playing a tambourine half the time. \"Alone Again\" which is mostly an acoustic song in the first place sounds godawful..Don Dokken is still the egotistical jerk that he is..and Lynch still looks p***ed to even be playing near him. Its no wonder this group broke up in the first place..they never got along and it should of stayed that way. There is some backstage footage but its very lame.",
