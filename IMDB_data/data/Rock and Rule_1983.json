        "reviewBody": "I was never fortunate enough to catch this film on the big screen. However, I did see it on cable in '86 and have been keeping my eyes open for a copy ever since. Having found an old bootleg recently, I was pleased that the animation is still truly amazing and has held up well over the years. The soundtrack is equally fine. Being a fan of stories with an apocolyptic bent, I really enjoyed this particular film. My friends and I still quote various parts of the film even after all this time. While the story is a little short, I feel it captures some of the frustration of being in a small-town band that is trying to break out. That and the fact this band must battle a vast evil is an interesting angle. Please won't someone re-release this diamond in the rough?",
