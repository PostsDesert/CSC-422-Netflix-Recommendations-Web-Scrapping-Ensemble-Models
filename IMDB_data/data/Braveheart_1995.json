I recently purchased it and have watched it at least five times since then, and each time i pick up on things I did not see the other times. The fight scenes are great, the plot is both interesting and thought provoking, there is romance and comedy. This is a movie that any person can appreciate at some level. \n\nTrue, the historical content may have been distorted, but even though, this movie is meant for entertainment. It is not a history lesson caught on video.\n\nThe acting is absolutely superb, this movie is guaranteed to have you on the edge of your seat for the entire three hours.",
