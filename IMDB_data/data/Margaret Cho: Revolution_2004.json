        "reviewBody": "\"Cho Revolution\" features Bruce Daniels as an opening act for the beautiful Margaret Cho. Having seen \"I'm the One That I Want\" and \"Notorious C.H.O.\", I knew what to expect. And without a doubt it was delivered to me on a silver platter shaped disc that was \"Cho Revolution\". I love Margaret's comedy, even though it is extremely vulgar. I am a Christian. I am also considered a hippie. I never repeat anything Margaret says without editing. I do agree that gays should have equal rights, though. That's what the revolution is all about. Margaret Cho is a great example of love. Love for yourself. Love for your race. Love for others. Cho, in my eyes, is equality. I admire her for having the courage to speak out when no one else will. I think that Margaret Cho is a sign of hope for gays and lesbians. Cho should feel really great about herself. In this movie, she continues to discuss sex, eating disorders, equality, and her wacky mother. I rate this 6/10 because of vulgarity. Bruce Daniels was somewhat lame so I rate him 5/10.\n\n\"Oh girl, we almost got lost in the Bermooda Triangle\" - Margaret Cho"
