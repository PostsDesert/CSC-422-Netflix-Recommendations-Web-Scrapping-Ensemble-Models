        "reviewBody": "If you like Hindi movies, dont miss YUVA, the latest and best by Mani Ratnam (maker of Roja, Bombay and Dil Se). Yuva is better than all the last three. Although it has all the usual elements dance/song/action etc, direction is superb and the theme of youth revolting against corruption and contributing to society keeps it going. Ajay Devgan is a student leader who stands against threatening politician Om Puri. Vivek Oberoy is a happy go lucky Romeo and is transformed into a rebellion when he meets Ajay Devgan. Abhishek Bachchan is a gangster tapori being exploited by Om Puri. All have excelled in their acting.\n\nEntire movie is made in Calcutta, this is the best depiction of this city. One is left amazed by the beautiful locales of Calcutta, hitherto unknown to outsiders.\n\nThis is how the powerful media of cinema can be used to portray optimism of the youth energy. Unfortunately, most of the bollywood is not doing such work."
