        "reviewBody": "I'm sixteen with a two year old sister, so it's inevitable that I'll be put through every single Disney movie and kids programme under the sun... Then along comes this DVD, and I'm thinking 'Oh, god no!' I had never seen the Wiggles as a child, so for all I knew it was just another terribly annoying programme with slow-talking, incredibly irritating people talking to my sister like she's a baby. But I was pleasantly surprised. The Wiggles is great family entertainment - the songs are surprisingly foot-tapping and we've all danced at some point! Yet the lyrics are still easy for the kids to pick up, and I find myself even singing the songs without realising! You can tell everybody just had a right good time while filming this. Steve Irwin as a special guest is fantastic, he was really a great guy (R.I.P, Steve, the world will miss you terribly!!!). There are parts where he talks about some of the animals at his zoo, which absolutely fascinated both me and my sister. It's touching to see how he will always still inspire and teach people. Bottom line - Got kids? Get this! They'll love it.",
