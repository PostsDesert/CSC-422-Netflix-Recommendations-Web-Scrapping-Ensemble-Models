        "reviewBody": "I'll have to explode the bomb here, because the other reviewers seem a little too forgiving, for whatever reasons.\n\nThis is a terrible pilot for a cable-TV show that, apparently (thank god) wasn't broadcast.\n\nTwo friends grow up in a mob-controlled neighborhood; one becomes the hit-man of for the mob, one a professional assassin for the CIA. They are at last re-united to save an ex-hippie who has discovered a mob-CIA connection that is cheating both mob and CIA out of big bucks. Along the way, there's a love interest or two, family business with the mob-boss, the ex-hippie discovers he's attractive to a ditsy blond (comic relief), computers are essential to the plot, all guns come equipped with silencers and the two heroes are allowed to pose ala The Boondock Saints (from whence this movie gets its inspiration, if it has any). Lots of shooting and little blood (the old TV give-away) and explosions and of course about four big car-chases, since people who make these kinds of films think cars are just naturally exciting (yawn).\n\nThe whole story is dismally cynical, towards its characters, its culture, and its audience. However, being an action film, this might be forgivable - except the film is pretty darn low on action, and when it happens, it's handled rather poorly.\n\nThere's no one to care about here, and the plot is pointlessly nonsensical. And - the big nail in the coffin, especially for action films - it's just plain dull.\n\nTake some Quaaludes and watch paint dry, you'll have more fun.",
