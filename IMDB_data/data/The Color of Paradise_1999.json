For many years, \"Les Miserables\" (French) with Jean-Paul Belmondo was my highest recommendation. \"The Bridge\" (German) was equally haunting. But having discovered \"Color of Paradise\" (I watched it every night for five nights)I bought the DVD. I don't imagine that I will ever see a more emotionally invasive film. I've joined IMDb simply to enjoin others who loved this film. For some months, I've been trying to find the words to help organize my impressions. Where other senses may become more acute with the loss of one, perhaps the congenitally blind don't realize how emotionally transparent they are. For me, this film really struck a nerve. It is a story-journey into the world in which we live but don't often see. It left me wondering who, in this world, are actually blind? This child, his grandma and two little sisters, are consummate. I must remind myself they were only acting. I must picture set, sound, lighting, script, direction etc. to decern that this is \"only a movie\". For everything this little boy appeared to need, he found ways to give real treasures to everything around him. The sound and cinematography were excellent. The pointed themes of this film were were heart rending. Six months later, they remain so."
