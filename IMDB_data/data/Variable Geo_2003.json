        "reviewBody": "Out of all the animes that came out in the U.S. in the year 1999, this is one of the most bizarre, yet enjoyable anime mini-series. Based on the popular Japanese all female fighting game series, Variable Geo (or V.G. for short) is a popular national sport in a semi-futuristic Japan. The rules are simple: if the fighter loses, they have to strip and embarrass themseleves in front of a viewing public. But it's run by a corrupt corperation with an alterior motive, which I don't wish to spoil.\n\nOverall, it's a good mix of all kinds of genres in addition to stylish animation and character designs.\n\n10/10",
