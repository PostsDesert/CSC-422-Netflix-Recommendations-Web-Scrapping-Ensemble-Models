This probably is the worst story I've ever seen, and as a fan of b-movies, horror and science fiction I've seen a lot of crap, but that one beats everything I've ever seen. It's not even cheesy. The only reason I didn't switch the channel was cause I was to lazy to search for the remote. Well, and cause I was playing on my computer so I was distracted enough so I didn't take any permanent damage by it. 1 of 10 points. This movie has nothing in it worth watching.",
