I got that feeling during Muppet Treasure Island, and as a result it is one of my favorite movies.\n\n I thoroughly enjoyed Kevin Bishop's (Jim Hawkins) performance: since I usually find young/child actors to be very grating, that's saying something. The Muppets were, as usual, all very funny. The jokes and asides were too, too funny (like Gonzo finding Henry Kissinger's book Diplomacy' in Captain Billy Bones' trunk), the songs were fun and catchy, and the pace was brisk and exciting. Tim Curry looked like he was having the time of his life playing Long John Silver amidst a sea of Muppets. I had great fun watching his performance.\n\n Go watch this movie if there's even a spark of kid in you. You won't regret it."

        "description": "The Muppets are back in action as they sail the high seas in their own twist of the classic tale by Robert Louis Stevenson. Having heard the legend of Captain Flint's massive treasure, young cabin boy Jim Hawkins (Kevin Bishop), along with The Great Gonzo (Dave Goelz) and Rizzo the Rat (Steve Whitmire) set out on a frantic search for it on a mysterious island. Accompanied by Squire Trelawney (Fozzie Bear) (Frank Oz) and Captain Smollett (Kermit the Frog) (Steve Whitmire), Jim and his friends finally get their own taste of adventure. But they soon uncover a sinister plot by a band of villainous pirates who seek the treasure for their own led by the ship's devious cook Long John Silver (Tim Curry). Once on the island, they find it is full of danger including an inhabitant named Benjamina Gunn (Miss Piggy) (Frank Oz).",
