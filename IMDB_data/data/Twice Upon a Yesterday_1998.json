        "reviewBody": "I saw Twice Upon a Yesterday last night at a screening. My expectations were really low because I had not heard of this picture before and I didn't recognize any of the stars. On top of this, when I went to the theatre last night a special preview of Star Wars Episode 1 was playing on the same floor (I tried to sneak in but 20th Century Fox posted security at the exits). So a bit disappointed, I headed over to the screening for Twice Upon a Yesterday. And I must say I was very surprised. The acting performances were pretty terrific and the story/writing was pretty good as well. The story kinda reminded me of \"Sliding Doors\" in a way but I feel that this film is actually a much better fable. I don't want to give too much away but there are quite a few funny surprises and twists that make this movie an interesting experience. And if you are into philosophy, you will love the questions this picture raises about life and love. There is also a terrific breakout star in this, Penelope Cruz who plays Luisa is drop dead gorgeous (she has a role in Billy Bob Thornton new picture).\n\nMy only criticism would be that the filmmakers did not use its London locale to its fullest, you almost feel as if this picture was shot on a backlot. More shots of the London scenery would have given the picture much more of a storybook feel. But all in all, I would recommend this movie (at the very least if your searching for a good video a few months from now and see Twice Upon a yesterday go ahead and rent it).",
