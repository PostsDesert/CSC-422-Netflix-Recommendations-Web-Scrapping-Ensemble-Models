It is so bad that it'll have you in fits of laughter. It tries to have a little sub-plot about a strange romance between the monster and a woman in a secluded cabin, but that could have been left out. The monster swings somebody's intestines around, picks a camping bag up and swings it around to impale it on a pole...and best of all, he rips a guy's member off...how could you not laugh?? if this were all done in a more realistic manner (if something that macabre could be realistically at all), maybe it wouldn't have been. But if you like bad movies and you're one of those that likes to watch movies with friends and family only to make fun of them, pick this one up. It's hard to find however."
