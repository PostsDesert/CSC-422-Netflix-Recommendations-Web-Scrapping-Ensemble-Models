        "reviewBody": "I will never understand why so many viewers dislike \"Jack Frost.\" It is a movie with heart warming and refreshing storyline. Michael Keaton stars as Jack Frost in this awesome movie about getting a second chance at being the world's greatest dad. Kelly Preston, Joseph Cross and Mark Addy co-star.\n\nI first noticed Joseph Cross, Charlie Frost, in the 100th episode of \"Touched By An Angel\" and since then I knew he was a talented young actor. Cross once again teamed with Keaton in \"Desperate Measures\" another awesome movie overlooked by the viewing audience.\n\n\"Jack Frost\" is the kind of movie that has heart-warming moments intertwined with comedic wit. Keaton and Cross seem to have a lot of fun making this movie together and it showed in their performances. Scenes like the one that had Jack Frost throwing snowballs at the school bully and his friends as well as the chase that followed made it all worthwhile to see because this is what makes movies so good.\n\nWatching this movie, it reminded me of \"Ghost\" because of its sweeping and heartwarming storyline.\n\nChemistry is one of the elements I look for in a great movie. \"Jack Frost\" has this element and more. While an unusual but a brilliant pairing, Keaton and Preston bring chemistry to \"Jack Frost,\" a movie that seems to be better than others I've seen before.\n\nI think Michael Keaton is one of the best actors I've seen and his performance in \"Jack Frost\" is one of his best films to date so WATCH it."
