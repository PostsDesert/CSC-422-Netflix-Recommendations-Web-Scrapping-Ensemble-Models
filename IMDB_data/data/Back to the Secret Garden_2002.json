Back to the Secret Garden does an excellent 'job' in my opinion. The storyline flows well.\n\nI have the original DVD of the original film, but for the moment have the sequel above as a TV recording. It is my intention, as with the Railway Children, and other films in our collection to have the original DVD 'set' to add to our growing collection of classic films.\n\nIf you have not seen this sequel for fear of it not being as good as the original, then rest assured, if you liked the original, you'll like this version too.",
