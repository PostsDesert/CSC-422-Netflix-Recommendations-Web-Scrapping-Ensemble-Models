        "reviewBody": "Fletch Lives (1989) is a movie I recently rewatched after DVR'ing it off Retroplex. The storyline follows our friend, Fletch, who recently inherits some land from his family in the south. Unfortunately for him the house is run down and the land appears useless; however, for some reason this strange church wants to acquire his land. As he digs into why he uncovers unbelievable \"demons\" in the town that have been swept under the church's carpet.\n\nThis movie is directed by Michael Ritchie (The Golden Child) and stars Chevy Chase (National Lampoon's Vacation), R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket), Hal Holbrook (Creepshow), Julianne Phillips (Skin Deep), Cleavon Little (Blazing Saddles) and Geoffrey Lewis (The Night of the Comet).\n\nI'm going to be in the minority but I like this one way more than the original. This cast is magnificent and Ermey was hilarious as the preacher. Chevy Chase was in classic form in this movie starting with an awesome butt-pinch office scene and continuing into some great \"sinning\" scenes with him and Ermey. Ermey and Chase had great chemistry throughout this film. The southern jokes throughout the film was tremendous and had me cracking up from beginning to end.\n\nOverall this is a gem that delivers classic 80s humor and is an absolute must see. I would score this a solid 7-7.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",
