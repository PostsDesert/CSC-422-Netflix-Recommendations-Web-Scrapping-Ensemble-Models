        "reviewBody": "Extra fun watching with fellow Quakers on a course in England, a film sensitively exploring the situation of Quakers at a transitional time in the 19th century, soon to on the whole discard the obsession with hats and the universal 'Thou' and 'Thee', but yet to be greatly challenged into 20th century with choices of behaviour at times of war. There's a lot of laughs but it stops short of mockery and there's real sympathy to be had for the Quaker nuclear family so well played here by all. The novelties and dissipations of the time are viewed through a Quaker lens and of course some kind of accommodation to it all, indeed to the matter of the civil war's challenges takes place, but all participants maintain their dignity and self-assurance. There's lots of mild innuendo and diversion from the serious matters, which all get wrapped up oddly satisfactorily in a little over 2 hours.",
