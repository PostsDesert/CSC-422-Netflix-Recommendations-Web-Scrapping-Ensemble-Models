I deeply loved Sense and Sensibility, and I liked Remains of the day, both with Emma Thompson. I hated her in Howards End. I couldn't understand WHY she married Wilcox, and how she could forgive him for everything he did during the movie... What a waste of time.\n\nThe DVD \"spoils\" the end by saying it's a \"triumph\". I don't see where the triumph is. The only thing I saw is that I wanted the screenwriter and the director to pay for having spoilt 143 minutes of my life. If you want a really fantastic period movie about love, watch Sense and Sensibility ! Don't waste your time on this... Believe me, I appreciate 95% of the movies I watch, but this one was one of the worst. Now, do whatever you like... But you're warned."
