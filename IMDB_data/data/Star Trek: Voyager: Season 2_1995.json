It can be compared to the original Star Trek, in its go-where-no-one-has-gone-before identity.\n\nHumor and drama, action and sometimes even horror are well-balanced in Voyager, the characters started off slightly odd but eventually became edgy but fast friends with each other. Even Neelix, the Talaxian who often looks as if he's wearing rejects from Quark's wardrobe, has become a far more palatable and even likable character.\n\nIf Neelix can make me laugh, then Voyager has its niche. :)"
