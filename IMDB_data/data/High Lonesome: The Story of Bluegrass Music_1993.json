Throughout the entire picture voices are speaking and singing over video of people speaking and singing - but one has nothing to do with another. I actually wanted to know what was going on in the concerts and interviews I saw and I found the structure of this film very irritating. I restarted the film twice to see if that made a difference. I guess I would have rather have listened to this on the radio. Looks like IMDG is forcing me to stretch this into ten lines because that's their rule. Stupid rule.",
