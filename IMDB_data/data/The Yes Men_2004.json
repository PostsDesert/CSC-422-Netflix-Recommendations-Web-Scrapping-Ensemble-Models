They travel the globe acting like WTO officials to make their point that if you look like you are in charge, you can say and do whatever you like.\n\nReally got the audience fired up (although was a preaching to the choir a bit since it was a human rights watch event.)\n\nAnyhow - one of the directors and one of the yes men were there for the Q&A.\n\nWas really interesting but went on a little.\n\nThe movie is more about the two guys and their adventures than the WTO - so you may want to do some research before you go or go to their site to get more info before seeing the movie.\n\nNot revolutionary but worth the 90 minutes. Has some of the funniest moments I've seen in a long time.",
