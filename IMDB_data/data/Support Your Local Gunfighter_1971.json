        "reviewBody": "James Garner was always good in westerns (just watch the original \"Maverick\" series if you don't believe me), but he was never more in his element than he is in \"Support your Local Gunfighter\".\n\nThis has got to be one of the funniest westerns (besides \"Blazing Saddles\") I've ever seen. In fact, everyone here has a good line (even Conners as Swifty Morgan gets some good ones. Wow!).\n\nBut you have to watch it for Garner. Just look at him making the best of his unfounded notoriety as a gunfighter. He's a master at mistaken identity. He made it a daily practice in the \"Maverick\" series. And with Elam at his side, everything falls into place nicely. \n\n There are too many good things in this film to even hint at, so I'll just insist that you support James Garner and draw on this \"Gunfighter\".\n\nTen stars. Catch Elam's final monologue; that should tie up any loose ends for you."
