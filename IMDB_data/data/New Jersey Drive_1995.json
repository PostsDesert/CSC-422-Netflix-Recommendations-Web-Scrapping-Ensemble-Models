        "reviewBody": "New Jersey Drive is a very underrated movie to put it quite bluntly. As it's supposed to in urban movies, the street atmosphere was definitely there. The script was good because it showed a crrosroad as Jason's crew and the cops lives crossed paths, I don't wanna give this away though. Sharron Corley gives a good performance as the humble but tough Jason, as does Gabriel Casseus as the knucklehead Midget and Don Faison as Tiny Dime, etc., etc. It was also wonderfully directed by Nick Gomez and also stars Heavy D and Michele Morgan.\n\nauthentic street movie 10/10"
