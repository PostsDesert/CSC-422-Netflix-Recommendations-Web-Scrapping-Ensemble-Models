Ann being eulogized for her talent of walking a tightrope between being commercial and being artistic, this one just falls between two stools and fails to satisfy anyone. Probably most notable for being the last film of the Hong Kong diva Cherie Chung, who announced her marriage and retirement shortly before the shooting had been finished.",
