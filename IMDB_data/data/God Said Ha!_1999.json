It takes a humorous and very brave look at a very serious situation. \"God said Ha!\" is an intelligent, entertaining and involving film. The title is taken from a Get Well card a friend sent Sweeney.\n\n. One warning. If \"Porky's\" is your idea of sophisticated humour, this is not the film for you. A modicum of intelligence and sensitivity is required.\n\n. Executive producer Quentin Tarantino, makes a brief cameo appearance at the end.",
