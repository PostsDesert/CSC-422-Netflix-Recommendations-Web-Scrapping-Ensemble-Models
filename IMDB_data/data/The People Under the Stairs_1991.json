        "reviewBody": "The People Under the Stairs (1991) \n\n*** (out of 4) \n\nStuck in the ghetto and about to be evicted while his mother is needing surgery for a cancer, a young kid known as Fool (Brandon Adams) agrees to help a man break into the landlord's house because there's rumors that it is full of gold. The two make it inside the house but they run into a bizarre couple (Everett McGill, Wendy Robie) as well as many other things living in the basement.\n\nBy the time 1991 rolled around the horror genre was pretty much dead but there were a few interesting movies that managed to get released, although the box office numbers still weren't very good. Wes Craven's THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS is a film with many, many flaws but at the same time it's certainly an original film that tries to do something more than just shock the viewer with gore effects. The film manages to mix in a political statement with the horror and there's even some humor thrown in as well.\n\nI think the best thing going for the movie is the lead character and the actor. The situation is quite simple as a poor kid must resort to a crime so that his family might have a better future. We already want to see the kid succeed at getting the money but once we see how derange the two living inside the house are we just want to see him win even more. Adams gives an extremely good performance for someone his age and it's certainly a lot better than you typically see in a film like this. A.J. Langer is also extremely good in her role as a girl trapped inside the house. McGill has always been fun to watch and he and Robie have a great chemistry together. Even Ving Rhames is good in his part.\n\nCraven certainly knows how to milk a scene for drama and he perfectly knows how to set up various scenes that are aimed to build tension. The atmosphere he creates is certainly another major plus as is the terrific cinematography and the music score. However, there are some flaws including the fact that the movie runs at least ten minutes too long. Some of the scenes go on a bit too long and I think it was a mistake leaving the house for a brief period of time towards the end.\n\nStill, THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS is a rather original movie and while it didn't have the same impact as something like A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, it's still an interesting movie that's worth watching."
