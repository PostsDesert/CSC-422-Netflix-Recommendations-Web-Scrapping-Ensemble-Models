It's actually quite a nice change of pace to see a cerebral zombie flick, though - one that relies on mystery and characterization instead of torrents of gore. As usual for a Hammer movie, the cast consists of cool character actors who could out-perform a good half of our current big stars. Andre Morell is great as our concerned hero, John Carson makes a suitably sleazy villain, and veteran Hammer guest star Michael Ripper gets one of his meatiest, most memorable roles. A solid flick, if not terribly fast-paced or gripping. It's fun to summarize the plot to your friends when you're drunk (it's about zombies...mining TIN!)"
