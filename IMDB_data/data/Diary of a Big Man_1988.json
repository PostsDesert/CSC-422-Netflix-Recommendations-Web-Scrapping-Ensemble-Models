        "reviewBody": "Wealthy Mr.H seems to have lost everything: His health, his youth, his wife and even control over his own fortune. But he has kept something far more important : His desire for beautiful women. And that life-affirming passion, fueled by the tempting nearness of his sultry daughter -in-law, lets him escape from his sickbed into the rich world of submissive fantasies and remembrance. Beatie Edney plays quite an enchanting, but very natural Dominatrix. Look inside the \"DIARY OF A MAD OLD MAN\" and you'll find humor and tragedy, wisdom and sensuality . Unformulated, the movie delivers surprise by surprise at a very slow pace, as to make the viewer feel \"his age\". Coming closer to our hero's age, I didn't mind this pace at all, I found some rather delicious and inspiring moments in it.",
