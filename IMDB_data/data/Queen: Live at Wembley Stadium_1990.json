A Queen concert has always been something special, and this video captures the spirit and shows us the unforgettable Freddie Mercury in his prime, a human powerhouse with an incredible voice and a unique show act.\n\nI was too young to visit the concerts in person back then, which is a sad fact I will never be able to remedy. But by watching this video, I get an idea of what it was like to be at such a concert in the 80s. Wonderful music, great audience, splendid performers... Queen remains for me the best Rock band of all time.",
