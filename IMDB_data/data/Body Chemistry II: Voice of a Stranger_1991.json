        "reviewBody": "To see the likes of Gregory Harrison in this trashy film is sad. I have great admiration for his work, such as IT'S MY PARTY, and to see him reduced to play this kind of character, is demeaning. What a handsome guy he is and certainly can do better than the looney tunes of the whacko female doctor that seems to go around doing men in. The fact that she can so easily handcuff her male companions is totally unbelievable. I mean, let's be realistic, her sex appeal I give a zero on.\n\nHer one dimensional performance goes from sashshaying about in up to here dresses, overly made-up in a whorish fashion and delivering what I assume she thinks is sexy dialogue. Boring. Morton Downing Jr. is also wasted in a rather seedy over the hill performance. It's Gregory Harrison that brings any excitement to this movie, but, unfortunately, he's asked to portray an idiot. He's got too much class to convince me of that. Sorry, Greg! Come on and get back to some better film choices or come back to Broadway. We miss you."
