        "reviewBody": "Science Fiction is a great device for writing about social politics, and these four short films do this well in some way or another.\n\nThe first story is the sharpest, and questions how we value motherhood against normal human values. The serious point, that babies are truly alien to your life, is well made.\n\nThe second film slighly connects love of science fiction with withdrawl from real life. And this film was in a Sci-Fi festival!\n\nThe third film is light relief, but does explore alienation and fear in a simple way.\n\nThe last film is in someways the most traditional, in that it looks at the ultimate mechanization of human life. \n\nAll these stories are in turn funny, sexy and intelligent - I wouldn't say that any were original, well produced or deep. A good film for a new director.",
