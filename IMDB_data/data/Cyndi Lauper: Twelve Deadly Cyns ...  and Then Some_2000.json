All the videos are there, and a few rarely seen videos (Who Let in the Rain, Thats What I think, Sally's Pigeons, and The World is Stone). However, and few important ones were left out: Hole in My Heart, The Goonies R Good Enough (parts one and two), and My First Night Without You. Boy Blue wasn't included, but it was just a concert clip from Cyndi Lauper in Paris, which a TRUE fan would own already anyway! I just wish they would put this collection on DVD! That would be great, especially if they included those extra videos I mentioned! But a definite must for any fan of Cyndi or pop culture in general! ENJOY",
