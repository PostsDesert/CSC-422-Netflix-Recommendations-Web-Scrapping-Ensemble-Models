Kyle the male member of the trio takes the model to a seminar about \"going straight\" and hijinks ensue. This is a bit more entertaining than the first and like that one it's funny and sexy with a bunch of eye candy. Although it's all quite predictable its more than amusing and is another somewhat successful entry in the growing queer sex comedy franchise.\n\n6.5/10",
