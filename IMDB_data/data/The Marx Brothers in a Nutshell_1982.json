This was first video showed in my Cinema studies class covering the life and works of the Marx Brothers. I was pleasantly surprised to see that instead of addressing the brothers as a whole each brother was described in detail both on camera and off. This is an amazing documentary that clearly shows how the Marx Brothers affected other great comedians such as Woody Allen and Dick Cavett, as well as the impact they have had on a variety of generations. If you ever wanted to know what kind of fast pace intelligent humor you were getting into this would make a great introduction.",
