        "reviewBody": "Superman: The Last Son of Krypton is a movie that serves as the three-part series premiere to Superman: The Animated Series. In this, Jor-El sends his infant son when Krypton is destroyed, the knowledge kept from the planet's people by Brainiac, who also escapes. The baby grows up under the name of Clark Kent, and after learning of his heritage after saving a little girl from an exploding RV, he moves on to Metropolis as an adult and becomes Superman. And at a good time, as Lex Luthor is plotting to give a battlesuit to terrorists from Kaznia.\n\nA show released four years after Batman: The Animated Series, Superman: The Last Son of Krypton has the same great storytelling as its predecessor, despite being set in a lighter tone. The action sequences are great, and there is even a reference to Batman (since his cartoon came first). This is a good start to one of the greatest animated shows of the 1990's.",
