        "reviewBody": "This movie was a big disappointment. In the first hour of the movie there is very little going on.There are couple of funny scenes between Wolodylowski and Zagloba in the beginning and then nothing worth watching happens. The movie has some action later on but hardly worth spending 2 hours to watch the whole thing.Lots of scenes are just there to fill the movie with nothing going on . Some of the fighting and fencing scenes are hardly believable. You never get involved in the movie and puzzled by some action that the lead Wolodyjowski does toward the end of the movie. There are couple of other movies that I have seen by this director and all of them are awful bores to watch. Roman Polanski should have directed a movie like this.",
