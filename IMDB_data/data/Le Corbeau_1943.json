        "reviewBody": "This film is terrifying. The opening scene of the town shot over a cemetery gives hints of what is to come. The poorly-focused quality (typical for copies of this film?), combined with high contrast give it a surreal appearance. The story is of profound cruelty. The misanthropy of a few is distributed effectively (via hundred of poison pen letters) among the many, working to provoke suspicion, persecution, suicide and revenge. This film brings back memories of other horror films of spreading malaise (Night of the Living Dead, eg), but is all the more effective because there is nothing supernatural at work....only the darkness of the human heart...."
