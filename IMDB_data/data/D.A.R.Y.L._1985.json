But it is just the type of movie I enjoy watching after a difficult day at work. DARYL and his family and his neighbors are nice decent people. The villains are properly villainous. They humor is light and fun. (I especially like the part where DARYL's mom is telling her friend about all the things DARYL does, like make his bed and iron his cloths.) The ending is wonderful and hilarious. \n\nIf you haven't seen it please do. It is fun and enjoyable and it is an excellent family movie.",
