Probably less plot here, more focus on action. And there's plenty of that. They have upped the gore & to be fair, given the micro budget, they have done a reasonable job. Lighting & production values are improved, sadly the acting hasn't. We still get gratuitous shower scenes but here, be warned, we get a guy playing with erect penis!",
