The family is made up of eccentric characters that are memorable in their individual characterizations. Where the Heart Is(1990) is a bright and wonderful movie that is one of Boorman's overlooked and underrated. The performance of Dabney Coleman is probably the best he has given in a long career of making motion pictures. One of the best films of the 1990s which I would love to see on DVD."
