        "reviewBody": "Much credit goes to the director for keeping the focus on Shakira. We get to see the audience for a second or two, some of the band members, but most of the time the cameras stay on Shakira, both when she's dancing and when she's singing. Not many extreme close-ups, which is good. Excellent sound quality and nice editing. Shakira goes through many costume changes but we don't have to wait as these parts are edited out and yet the transitions are smooth. The Columbian singer gives a high energy performance and it's enjoyable to see her many expressions throughout. She gets on the floor a few times which may remind the viewer of Gloria Trevi! Excluding the documentary, the actual concert time is 90 minutes. The only short coming is that we only see the guitarists, for the most part, among the band members, and for some odd reason never see the backup singers.",
