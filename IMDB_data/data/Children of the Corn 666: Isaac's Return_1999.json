We got hung up on the Children of the Corn series from the start. Corn and demonic children, what a FANTASTIC combination! We laughed through each and every Corn flick up til 666, which we rented last night. All those wonderful earlier films about He Who Walks Behind The Rows... and for that! How disappointing! :( It wasn't even that funny this time. Where were all the _children_?!?! My suggestion: don't even bother. I give this film a 3/10, just because they didn't have as many continuity mistakes and the gore was actually sort of gory.",
