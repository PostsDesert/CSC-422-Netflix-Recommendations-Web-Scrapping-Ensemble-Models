That was the first time I've ever watched My Little Pony and the resolution was quite old. That was 8 years ago.. wasn't that long ago.\n\nBecause I used to like movies like the lion king and Bolt, watching a \"girls TV\" was a new thing for me (as I never liked Barbie and stuff) but I actually liked this show. The animations were cute!",
