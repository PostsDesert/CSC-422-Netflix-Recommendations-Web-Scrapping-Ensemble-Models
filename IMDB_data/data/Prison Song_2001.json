        "reviewBody": "The opening of this movie3 reminds me of a time in this country when the standard for porn was \"socially redeeming value.\" They would have some doctor appear at the beginning or show some scrolling information to justify the movie to follow. In the same way, prison Song starts with a recap of the number of black in prison and the wasted youth. That is tragic, but no more tragic than this movie.\n\nYes, there is a story of a promising artist who ended up in prison for being at the wrong place at the wrong time and getting a bum lawyer in a system that just doesn't care about minorities. But, basically, this is a vehicle for the rapper Q-tip. Not being familiar with his work, I cannot comment on the music, just the boring story.",
