        "reviewBody": "Very complete biography of Miles Davis through the eyes of his family, band member, influences etc..\n\nTo me Miles Davis is modern jazz. He's the scientific doctor who invented this new science in music. His legacy is so obvious, but there wasn't a complete biographical movie done about him until this one. Miles was different in many ways from other black musicians. He was from a middle class family, he was very smart, and started his musical career at a school brass band.\n\nTo me he is the first \"intellectual\" jazz musician. He constructed his music from an idea perspective that nobody else have done. Often this approach is too cold for me, but it's clean and beautiful like no one else's music.\n\nThis is a great documentary on life of Miles Davis. It shows the many sides of the complex man. Although how he was able to create his music remains elusive, we do get to see the path Miles have taken as a musician, and that's a worthwhile addition to anyone's musical library.",
