        "reviewBody": "This made-in-Canada cheapie is a must own for any Dead Kennedys fan or anyone who has any interest in the early days of San Fran punk rock. It includes some great footage of Jello Biafra running for office, and sing-along option for those of you unfamiliar with the language of Jello. Among performances at historical locations such as Mabuhay Gardens, Sproul Plaza, and one at 330 Grove St., are two live recordings at Target Studios. So enjoy, let East Bay Ray's solos, Klaus Flouride's possessed bass, Ted Peligro's frantic drumming and Jello Biafra's Johnathon Swiftian lyrics take you into the late 70s and early 80s and show you what lame feature's like SLC Punk couldn't. And remember, \"There's always room for jello.\"",
