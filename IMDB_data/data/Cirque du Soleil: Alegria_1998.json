        "reviewBody": "I have seen at least 8 of the Cirque shows - (the most fun are those in the circus tent) - and I look forward to the shows coming to my home each year. Watching the 3D movie was a treat. Since they were able to have cameras in so many different locations - above, below- the effects are really great. I liked the fact that you could hear the smacking of the acrobats shoes on the big wheels - really got the feel and the danger of that act. \n\nI loved the beginning from \"O\" - the water adds to the acts. You are able to really see the actors - and appreciate the talent they have. I would go again - I will buy this DVD - and I will continue to go to the live performances. Even though I am not an Elvis or Beatles fan - I liked the music. Would like to have seen some of Michael Jackson in it - that was a fantastic live show.\n\nThank you for bringing this to the theaters - many people cannot afford the price of the live shows and this brings it to more people. I am glad that others will be able to see it. And I will again.",
