I was a HUGE \"Street Fighter II\" fan and this movie was like a dream come true despite the fact that Guile was the main character; overshadowing Ryu and Ken. Still, I bought the idea and went to the theater with high expectations.\n\nTo be honest, the movie is not a disaster but it just didn't catch the vibe of the video game; it just didn't feel like \"Street Fighter\". The kung-fuesque action sequences were very interesting but didn't follow the greatness of the game. Mortal Kombat worked because it's characters were \"real\" persons while it was extremely complicated to get on the big screen real persons that were originally cartoons. \n\nAlso, the plot was very complex when the video game makes it very simple. Still I enjoyed the cheese factor of it. The producers and Director tried too hard to make it feel like the video game but they couldn't reach the objective. Sadly, this movie is remembered as one of the worst of it's kind. I'd say give it the chance to witness cheese at it's maximum.\n\nR.I.P. Raul Julia.",
