        "reviewBody": "This film is well worth watching for the emotions that are allowed to develop between the main characters. The mysterious stranger has his own secrets, and it may possibly just have happened, (leaving room for artistic license.) I liked being caught into that particular time-frame of the '40's when morality still existed in the American culture, and people (generally) had depth of character. The film does not \"assault\" the viewer, like so many recent releases will assault the senses. Really well acted and directed, I thought."
