        "reviewBody": "I remember this movie for one real thing, the soundtrack. I bought it on vinyl and played a few songs until they were scratched, the fabulous \"Do you believe in shame\" by Duran Duran was one of my favourites and remains so to this day.\n\nI like this film, I really do. Okay so it now looks dated, but the rest of the film is extremely good. Mel Gibson plays a big time Drug Dealer now trying to go straight but seemingly lined up for one final big deal, or so the Police think, and his old school friend who is now the Chief of Police in the same city, Kurt Russell. Russell rocks, he really does, and they play off each other so perfectly. Michelle Pfieffer is the female caught between them who falls for one, and then the other, each playing the reverse of what you think their character may be and each, in their own way, using her to gain information on the other. That plot device alone makes the movie work for me and I love watching the dynamics between all three characters.\n\nAlthough a couple of plot turns need a little twist of the imagination, it's still very well written and carried through to the screen with these actors giving good performances to take it there. I still have a soft spot for this movie.",
