        "reviewBody": "I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the birth of horror and how it has grown up to 1996. Listening to the actors like Vincent Price, Robert De Niro and Brinke Stevens, directors like Herschell Gordon Lewis, companies like Hammer Films, and others involved in the business was entertaining and informative.\n\nIt was fascinating to see how well known characters like Frankenstein changes over the years. I didn't even know that Robert De Niro did the character in 1994. From Frankenstein and the Wolf-man, we move to Hellraiser and Michael Myers, discovering along the way how some films were meant to be a one-time deal and ended up a franchise, and why we are so fascinated with demons. And, then there are dinosaurs, from 1 Million Years BC to Jurrasic park. I love a good Godzilla movie! \n\nChristopher Lee does a great job of narrating.",
