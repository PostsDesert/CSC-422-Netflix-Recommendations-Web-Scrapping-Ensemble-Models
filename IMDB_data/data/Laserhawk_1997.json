        "reviewBody": "Although Laserhawk had a promising start with a interesting concept, it rapidly went downhill. The film started slowly and needed to pick up pace but sadly it just petered out into and sorry collection of recycled cliches and over the top acting. Hamill indeed added some depth but the other characters were hamming it up left, right and center. The film ended abruptly after one of the poorest and least exciting space battles known to modern man. The actual action sequences were no better than the those seen in the Eighties series 'V' while the jerky animated aliens were not especially convincing either. It could have been so much better."
