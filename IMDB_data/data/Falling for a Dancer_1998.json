        "reviewBody": "This is a superb mini-series based on the book by Deirdre Purcell. Based in rural Ireland in the 1920s/ 30s, it explores many of the strong cultural influences at the time regarding the family, the importance of land, taboos about extramarital pregnancy etc. It depicts the difficulty faced by Lizzie (Elisabeth Dermot-Walsh) in turning from a young urban woman to the wife of an older rural man (Dermot Crowley), her struggle with her sexuality and ultimately her developing relationship with Mossie (Liam Cunningham).\n\nExcellent performances are particularly given by Liam Cunningham and Elisabeth Dermot Walsh, and both of these are names to watch for in the future."
