        "reviewBody": "The Street We Live On is a Sesame Street special made to celebrate the series' 35th anniversary (as well as serve as the first episode of the 35th season). Basically, the special is one big segment of Elmo's World where Elmo thinks about Sesame Street and the people that live there with him.\n\nIt's a nice special episode. While it is an extended Elmo's World segment, it actually fills out the original content bringing in classic Sesame Street skits like the Typewriter Guy, an opera version of C Is for Cookie, and even the old counting song with the clumsy chef at the end. However, it does get some things wrong (like the scene of Grover showing Elmo the past, as it shows some scene that happened after he was introduced in the show).",
