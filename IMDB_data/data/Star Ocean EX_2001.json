        "reviewBody": "When I first learned that the most popular video game was going to be a series. I've never imagine that this one would be it. But after checking out the trailer,I had to see it,and I did. When my father got me the series for Christmas,it was just like playing the video game once again. It was a spectacle to see,and I really enjoyed it. It kinda had the same story line,and the characters were almost the same as the ones from the video game. Another thing about the show is the places that the characters visited. My favorite characters in the series are:Opera,Ernest,Celine,and Dias. And my favorite funny parts were Celine using her magic on 3 Thugs,and Ashton falling in love with Barrels (Note):If he like them so much,he should marry them. But however,this show is one of the best. So in closing,if you have played the video game,then watch this series. It's the best.",
