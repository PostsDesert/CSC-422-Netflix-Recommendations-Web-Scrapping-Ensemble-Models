The cast does not seem to have a lot of \"previous experience\" under their belts and it is my understanding that some of them are the acting students of Skye Aubrey (who plays Delilah Leigh). Jamey Schrick (Bhuvan Bannerji) and J.R. Jones (Devin Leigh) have only this movie listed as credits despite having two of the major roles in the film. Both of their performances are quite good and they convincingly play the parts. So hop on the Bannerji Hollywood tour bus (aka a VW Microbus) and visit the hilarity.",
