        "reviewBody": "This movie is a watchable one. It's not really a memorable one though but when you decide to watch it, it won't bore you.\n\nWhen the movie began I was kind of worried. The editing was poor and the acting horrible B-movie like and it had a made-for-TV kind of look. But thankfully all those things improved later as the movie progressed.\n\nIt's obvious that the budget wasn't very big since they had to use stock footage from movies like \"U-571\" and even \"Down Periscope\". They also used stock footage from real WW II Destroyers and other boats which was pretty obvious at times, it was kind of amateur-like and unrealistic the way it was edited into the movie.\n\nThe story is pretty solid, despite some awfully weak dialog at times. It was at first kind of weird that the movie focused on both the Americans and Germans in the same way but later in the movie it becomes obvious why. The movie mostly fails to become tense but still its perfect good entertainment to watch all.\n\nNot a must see by any means but when you decide to see it nevertheless, you will be fairly entertained. And hey it has got William H. Macy and Thomas Kretschmann and some other well known actors in small roles in it, which makes this movie absolutely, very well watchable.\n\n7/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",
