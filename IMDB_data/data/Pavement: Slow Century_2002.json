And on DVD, it's difficult to navigate the menu.\n\nThat said, this is essential viewing for anyone interested in alternative rock. Pavement was the quintessential slacker band, bar none. SLOW CENTURY captures them in all their unadorned glory, boldly sacrificing tuning and practice for their special brand of magic. The live shows are somewhat chaotic as a result, but anyone familiar with the band would expect no less.\n\nOf course, you also get a collection of Pavement music videos, which offer unpretentious fun, start to finish.\n\nIn an era of antiseptic rock and American Idol posturing, these guys are the real thing.",
