        "reviewBody": "This is one of Cuba Gooding's best performances in years. Mr. Gooding has been on a dry run since his Oscar win in the supporting category for Tom Cruise's famous line-Show me the money!\n\nThis is basically a fun film. Cuba Gooding, recently fired from his job, returns to Georgia for the funeral of his beloved Aunt Sally. That funeral scene in the church is just memorably realized.\n\nGooding captures the part of the not so competent worker, with a kind and understanding heart.\n\nHe can keep the inheritance providing that he does something is an old Hollywood line. This time, it's the taking up of the choir.\n\nLaTanya Richardson gives a stoic performance as the holier than thou choir leader who looks to trip the Gooding character up so that she can maintain her position. She is just great as one who preaches reverence but has strayed herself.\n\nBeyonce Knowles belts it out. Of course, her rendition of fever can't be compared to that of the great Peggy Lee.",
