        "reviewBody": "Watching \"Idle Hands\" is like watching an R-rated rendition of \"Beetlejuice.\" It has the same tone as the Tim Burton classic. Though it is basically a dark comedy--emphasize the word \"dark\" as much as you can--there are some moments of graphic violence that the casual moviegoer might not expect out of a comedy. But not all comedies are meant to be like Mel Brooks movies. Peter Berg explained it perfectly on the David Letterman show when he was talking about \"Very Bad Things,\" which he wrote and directed. He said, \"Just like how some people, like me, like our food spicy--some people also want their comedy spicy.\" Just like \"Very Bad Things,\" \"Idle Hands\" is a grotesque, slightly off-putting comedy that won't be taken easily, but that's part of its appeal. It gives you that \"dark comic rush.\" And there are moments where you can't help but laugh hysterically. \n\nSeth Green and the other boy--I don't know his name--have some extremely funny moments. Most of the jokes have to do with scatological and drug-related elements, but they work perfectly. This is not for the prudish, not tailor-made for the sick and twisted (though they would probably take delight), but makes intelligent use of gruesome and coarse gags. I know that doesn't sound appealing on paper, but you'll see what I mean. See for yourself. \n\n\"Idle Hands\" is not for all tastes, it's not sophisticated and I would call it a popcorn movie...but you'd probably throw up your popcorn if you were to watch this flick. As for eye candy (for the guys) we have the stunningly beautiful Jessica Alba, who never gets naked (Dammit!) but struts around in a revealing blue nightie with her beautiful cleavage on display. She's just one of those extremely cute babes that you just want to cuddle like a teddy bear. \n\nIdle Hands may do the Devil's work, but it makes heavenly entertainment!\n\nMy score: 7 (out of 10)",
