        "reviewBody": "\"In The Weeds\" is a mediocre ensemble dramady repartee-fest about the staff of a restaurant and their activities during one night's dinner rush. The film offers a solid journeyman cast of familiar faces but relies too much on snappy patter and clever comebacks while trying to build a storyline that is marginal at best, groping for insight and sensitivity which never fully materializes. Nonetheless, there are several crisscrossing plot threads and enough energy and wit to make is a mildly entertaining broadcast watch. (C+) Note - Those interested in a very good drama which also takes place in a restaurant during one night's dinner rush should check out \"Dinner Rush\" with Danny Aiello.",
