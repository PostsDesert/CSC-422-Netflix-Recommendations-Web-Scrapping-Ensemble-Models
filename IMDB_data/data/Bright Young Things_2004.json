        "reviewBody": "\"Bright Young Things\" is a very stylish adaptation of the Evelyn Waugh novel, \"Vile Bodies\". I felt the film captured the snarky satire tone of the novel and was a fairly decent effort on the part of Stephen Fry who was making his directorial debut. I found the film played fairly light and enjoyable; a bit like a meringue that way. I suspect that this is a film for those with a fondness for wicked satire, in jokes and an interest in period pieces.\n\nThere is a kind of manic pacing to the film and the cinematography which I suppose matches the feeling of the time. People had survived a war, and a pandemic so it might make one a bit dotty.\n\nI was quite pleased by some of the work by some of the young actors who had never been in a film before. They had a pleasant ease infront of the camera.\n\nIt isn't going to be some over the top smash. It is one of those nice art house films that one later rents from the library and shares with certain friends who have a taste for colorful clothes and characters."
