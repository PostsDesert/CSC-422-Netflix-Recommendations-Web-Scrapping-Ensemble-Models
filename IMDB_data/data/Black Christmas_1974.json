        "reviewBody": "This film was really great to watch when I saw it last Christmas. I was expecting more of a \"Halloween\" type film, except the fact that the always brilliant Margot Kidder was in it. So I was into it from the start. The film follows a sorority house on the days proceeding Christmas when a psycho stalker starts getting into the house and, quite frankly, under the girls skin. Then the murders begin. The\n\nsetting has been seen before, and so have the P.O.V. shots, but who cares?\n\nThis film was scary anyway.\n\nOlivia Hussey is terrific and tense as the lead sorority sister, Jesse, who has the burden of dealing with all the other sisters' crisis problems. She looked really great too! And in the finale, she really played her role out for all it was worth.\n\nKier Dullea was descent. A little too humble for the role, and not as, well,\n\nintimidating as he could have been. His scenes here are played out like a play. if not Broadway style, more conservative.\n\nMargot Kidder, being as good as she is, was not surprisingly fabulous! Her\n\ncharacter was the rough tough stuff sister who drinks, swears, and is the only one of them who has the guts to show off some glitz. \n\nThe rest of the cast does just fine, particularly Andrea Martin as the soft spoken sister, John Saxon as the police chief who only wants to find the answer, and the actress who played Mrs. Mac was certainly worth the view too!\n\nWriting wise this film was greatly and adroitly planned. The central theme of this film is that you can't trust anyone, friend or foe, and the scares are genuine, and come psychologically, instead of in your face like \"Halloween\" or \"Friday the 13th.\" Bob Clark is in love with his actors as he photographs them in bright\n\nexuberant colors, while his killer is photographed in jaundiced, grainy colors. \n\nAll in all, a very artistic film and very creepy to the bone. Great atmospheric music too!",
