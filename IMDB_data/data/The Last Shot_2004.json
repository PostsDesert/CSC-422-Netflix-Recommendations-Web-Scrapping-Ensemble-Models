        "reviewBody": "From 2004, \"The Last Shot\" is one crazy movie, with comedy ranging from stupid to silly to hilarious. The movie stars Alec Baldwin, Matthew Broderick, Calista Flockhart, Tony Shaloub, Toni Collete, Ray Liotta, and Joan Cusack. Baldwin is Joe Devine, an FBI agent who thinks the way to capture a big mob boss is to deal with the Teamsters by pretending to be producing a film in Rhode Island. The script he gets from a fledgling writer Steven Schats (Broderick) is called Arizona and is based on the tragic death of his sister Charlotte. Of course, he first has to get Schatz to change the location and a few other things.\n\nBefore you know it, the fake filmmaking becomes real as Devine gets into producing and convinces the FBI that they can capture even more mobsters by actually doing the film. Soon the FBI offers him a three-picture deal.\n\nSome of the dialogue is the funniest stuff you'll ever hear, and some of the situations are hilarious. Everyone is excellent, but Toni Collette as insane movie star Emily French is a standout, as is Cusack as a Hollywood agent and Tony Shalhoub as the badly scarred mobster they're after, who says, \"My wife set fire to me while I was asleep. Six months later, our marriage fell apart.\" Parts of this film were laugh out loud funny, a highlight being Collette's audition as well as the opening scene of the film, an FBI sting, and Cusack's talk to the people who are going to work on the film.\n\nSome people will not like \"The Last Shot\" at all, but it's really worth seeing for the fun it pokes at the film business, for the performances, and some great quotes.",
