The comedy is moronic at worst, below kindergarten level at best, and 90% of the many B-list yet familiar names that Nico Mastorakis miraculously managed to procure for the film appear in one-sequence, take-the-money-and-run-before-they-recognize-me cameos (Brian Thomson has the most substantial screen time). The film practically ended Mastorakis' international cinematic career (he has made only one other film since then, a decade later), and no one who sits through it will ever wonder why. * out of 4.",
