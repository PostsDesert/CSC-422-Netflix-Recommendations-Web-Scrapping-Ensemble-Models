Well, to my surprise and delight I found Trois 3 and watched it FOUR times within TWO days!! It is very well made! Too bad this wasn't shown in the main theaters. Brian White is simply the most gorgeous man ever made, EVER!!! This film, besides the excellent cast, particularly one of my favorite actors Isaiah Washington, is very well made from a cinematography viewpoint. The director put it down on the real! At first, I was taken aback but upon the 2nd, 3rd, & 4th viewing, I got what he is trying to do. Reagan is right when she says you have to see it TWICE, at the very least. I believe once you see it, you will want to see it MORE than twice, like me! I bought this DVD sight unseen and its the best purchase EVER!!! I HIGHLY recommend it.",
