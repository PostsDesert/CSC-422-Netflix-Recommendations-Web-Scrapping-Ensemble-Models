Chris Seaver knows what he's making, and a schlocky, no budget, laugh-a-minute parody flick is just that. I mean, one character even references the fact that his hand has \"turned human\", since they obviously lost the goblin fingers prop/hand paint at that point of filming. They also reference cars going by in the basement scene. I mean come on, pretentious and classy this ain't. But they know it and use it to their full advantage.\n\nMaybe I can just relate to their sense of humor, like fake-worshiping celebs, mocking pop-culture, and just being downright obscene just to put a smile on someones face. \n\nAnd when it gets right down to it, if your watching this movie for ANY OTHER REASON than to be grossed out, roll your eyes and laugh at that silly sort of humor that comes out only when you and your best friends are drunk and stoned in someones basement, than your watching this for all the wrong reasons.",
