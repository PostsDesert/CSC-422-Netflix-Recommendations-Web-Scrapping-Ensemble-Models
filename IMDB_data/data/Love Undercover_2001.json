Fans of the romantic comedy genre and of Hong Kong stars Miriam Yeung and Daniel Wu as both the male and female leads, will find this movie worth their while. The suddenly flamting Daniel Wu seems to be everywhere these days and he'll probably go up from there. Miriam Yeung is adorable - it is no wonder why she is at the top of the box office. She'so at the top of her league - undeniably the best comedic actress around today. Sammi Cheng - she's hot on your tail! Pick it up - it'll give you some laughs and eye candy as well. :)",
