Next, if you're in a hurry or tired, wait until you're not. I almost deleted it because the marching band at the fort caught me on a migraine day. Instead, I kept it and waited till a rainy evening with no other plans. Perfect! I rarely laugh out loud when watching a film alone, but I laughed, hit rewind, and laughed again!! \n\nLancaster and Remick, with palpable chemistry, head a terrific cast that all looked liked they were having a blast! Yes, it was 30 minutes too long. During the sandstorm, go make popcorn. During the champagne bottles exploding everywhere scenes, go clean up the snacks. Other than that, don't watch this if you don't like satire, romance, and screwball westerns meant to bring women as well as men into the theater or, in modern times, to the TV screen. \n\nI hope this review reaches at least one viewer who will then stand with me:)",
