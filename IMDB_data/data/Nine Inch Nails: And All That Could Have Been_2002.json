I greatly enjoyed this DVD on my home theatre -- the sound totally immerses you; various people on stage sound like they're in front of you playing while the audience roars behind you.\n\nThe packaging is cool, yet minimalist. The little Reznor written inset is a nice touch. You may go through all the menus and think, \"I thought there would be more extras.\" There are more extras: they're mostly hidden. Probably the hardest one to find is the (in)famous Manson performance with Trent which originally showed they'd set aside their differences. You have to press enter towards the end of \"Starf**kers, inc\" (after the \"well, f**k you...\" line).\n\nOverall, a great addition for any fan's collection. The sound of the songs, quality digital encoding, and extras all add up to a great release.",
