It runs through all the plays, it runs through Diary of A Mad Black Woman, and although I haven't gotten to see the movie of Madea's Family Reunion yet, I'm willing to bet it runs through that as well.\n\nTyler Perry is a dedicated Christian, and that is the message of his work. The teachings of Jesus are filtered through Madea and her wild family, and although Madea says repeatedly that she'll be seen in church \"when they get a smoking section,\" she is the mortar which binds the family together.\n\nTyler Perry is probably the most talented man in the film industry today.",
