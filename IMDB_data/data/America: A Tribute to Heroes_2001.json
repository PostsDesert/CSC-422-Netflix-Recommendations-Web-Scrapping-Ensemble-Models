        "reviewBody": "I must have watched this video a dozen times by now and I have purchased multiple DVD copies which I have given away as gifts to family and friends who I care about deeply.\n\nThe list of performers is endless and memorable. I especially was touched by the performances of Sting, Billy Joel, Bon Jovi, Willie Nelson, The Dixie Chicks, Dave Matthews, Faith Hill and Alicia Keys just to name a few.\n\nThe Hollywood A Lister's were also out in full force relaying the individual heroism both of some of the survivors and deceased from the twin towers. No matter how many times I watch this concert I just feel so moved by the human kindness and love expressed for one another by the tragedy of the thousands of lives lost and affected by the falling of the twin towers.\n\nMuhummad Ali, Halle Berry, Tom Hanks, George Clooney, Tom Cruise, Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Danny DeVito, Cameron Diaz, Andy Garcia, Whoopi Goldberg, Michael Keaton, Lucy Liu, Mike Meyers, Jack Nicholson, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Kurt Russell, Adam Sandler, and Clint Eastwood were just some of the stars who were able to make it to New York City or were able to be streamed in from another part of the world to plead for financial support of the families affected by this tragedy.\n\nMy plea to the producers of this epic concert is to re-release this concert tribute to the deceased (and) heroes of September 11, 2001 on BLU RAY and I trust that the public across the world will come to the support of those fallen.\n\nI would give this concert an 11 out of 10 if allowed to do so. Lest we forget.",
