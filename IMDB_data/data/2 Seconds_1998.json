The initial (English) scenes at a downhill mountain-bike race at Mammoth Mountain is great although I would have like more of the dh racing 'cause it is a hoot. However, the scene in the bike shop where Lorenzo throws out a customer who had the audacity to ask the price of the fine Italian road bike in the window is priceless. All bike-shop owners should be like Lorenzo. The fact that the heroine is a lesbian and there are a few sex scenes didn't bother me, and I'm as straight as an arrow--sexually speaking that is. I found the acting great with only a few exceptions in minor characters.",
