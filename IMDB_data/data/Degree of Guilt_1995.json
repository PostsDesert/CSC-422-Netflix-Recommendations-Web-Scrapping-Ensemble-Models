I was so excited to see it after I had read the book. Which is a great court room drama. The book so amazing, which is usually the case. Yet, This mini series, WOW, It really was pathetic, the every thing that should not be allowed for viewers, (in case they have a sensitive tummy).\n\nNo *'s\n\nActing, Well there was not any.\n\nWorse then the Worst Soap.\n\nREAD the book, it is Excellent!!!!!! ! !"
