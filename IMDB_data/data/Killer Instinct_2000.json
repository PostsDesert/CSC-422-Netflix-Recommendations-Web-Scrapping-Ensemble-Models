There are some well-directed sequences that one usually doesn't find in this kind of flick. The female lead, Vanessa Angel, went on to star in Kingpin, Sleep With Me, the Weird Science TV series, and she certainly bares her all in this.\n\nThe cinematographer, Jennifer Stoltz, is actually a nom de plume for Janusz Kaminsky, who now shoots most of Spielberg's films. Scott Valentine is pretty weak in the main role, but this is an intriguingly written and directed movie.",
