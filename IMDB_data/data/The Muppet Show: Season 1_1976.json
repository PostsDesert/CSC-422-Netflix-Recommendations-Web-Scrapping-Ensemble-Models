I like the ones with \n\nJohn Denver Luke Skywalker and C3PO and especially the one with Christopher Reeve.\n\nI thought that the series was far better then Muppets tonight.\n\nI would love to see more of these shows brought out by a company other then Time Life. I was rather upset that the one with Christopher Reeve was not in the Best of Collection. It shows him doiong vets Hospital as well as a wonderful spin on Hamlet! \n\nThe muppet show had a magical feel to the series and Jim Henson was a true Genus in his field. God Bless Jim Henson... He is missed..."
