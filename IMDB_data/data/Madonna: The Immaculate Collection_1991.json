        "reviewBody": "I don't know why Madonna hasn't released this collection of her music videos on Blu-ray. Anyway, some fans were disappointed with this collection as some of her music videos were omitted. Such as \"Oh Father\", \"This Used to Be My Playground\", \"Bad Girl\", \"Fever\", \"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\", \"You Must Love Me\", \"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\", \"Nothing Really Matters\" and \"American Life\" (uncensored version). The \"American Life\" music video was amazing, but unfortunately Madonna's company didn't want the uncensored version to be released commercially. It is good to watch music videos on YouTube or download them on Apple Music, but I still like the idea of packaging and a little foldout that you can read with all the video directors credited.",
