        "reviewBody": "The characters carry this film. Chuvalo is huge: sometimes modest, sometimes arrogant, funny & ready to fight. The Ali footage in Toronto is great. \n\nOn the other hand, I've never witnessed a movie so compromised by its soundtrack. Moments of drama - passionate speeches or battles in the ring - are trivialized by swanky sax and piano tinkling. It gives the film the feel of a televised public announcement. What a mistake. Also, strange that it starts off with The Tragically Hip's So Hard Done By, (a dank rock song) to be followed by reams of lounge jazz. Strange choices made here. \n\nThe interviews were great, the footage too. It could all have been worked into something more compelling.",
