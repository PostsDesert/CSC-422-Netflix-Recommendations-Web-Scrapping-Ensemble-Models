They did a fabulous job, portraying their characters. Tony's Tong Choi is sweet, caring and funny. Sammi's Siu Tong is tomboyish but I liked her. One of the emotional scenes was when he called her on the cell phone and for a couple minutes, no one said anything...hehe...that's all I'm telling you people. You really have to watch this!!!",
