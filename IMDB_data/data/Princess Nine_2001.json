        "reviewBody": "i was really surprised by this series...\n\nthe story centers around Ryo Hayakawa, a happy-go-lucky 15-year-old schoolgirl who with an incredible left arm. like her late father, she's is an exceptional pitcher. were she a boy, she would have easily been recruited by one of any prestigious Japanese High School baseball teams for national competition.\n\nenter Keiko Himuro, Chairwoman of Kisaragi Girls' High School. for whatever reason, she wants to field an all-girl baseball team to compete against the boy-dominated Japanese National High School Baseball Association. in fact, not only does she what to compete, she wants to win: her overall goal is to see her girls go straight to Koshien Stadium, the site where the NHSBA champion is determined.\n\nRyo soon becomes the centerpiece of Kisaragi Girls' Baseball Team and race to Koshien is on.\n\nviewers are introduced to an eclectic cast of characters such as Shinsaku Kido, the hard-drinkin' coach of the girls' team who holds a few unorthodox views on training; the extroverted Hikaru Yashimoto, a talented softball player eager to make her mark in baseballl; Seira Morimura, a former high school track star who seemingly is heading down a path of self-destruction; tomboy Koharu Hotta, a girl who swings a mean stick and whose love for the game is second only to her devotion to her father; and tennis champion Izumi Himuro, the Chairwoman's daughter who strives hard to win games and harder to win the affection of her mother.\n\nthis is more than a story about baseball: it's a story about friends, family and the ties that bind.\n\npart high school soap opera, part sports drama... 'Princess Nine' has something for everyone. and it's a refreshing break for the 'big robot' genre of anime."
