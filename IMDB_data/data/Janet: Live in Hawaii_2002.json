        "reviewBody": "This was an excellent show and tour, which really displayed the fact that JAnet still has what it takes to compete against her younger peers. However i just felt as if the show was too similar, and at points, almost identical to her Velvet Rope Tour. I realize that she may have intended this in order to give the show a 'Janet' feel, but it just felt lazy on her behalf. The music selection was impressive, as she opens the show with the energetic ' Come on Get Up', and never lets up, with one big hit after the other. The choreographed dance segments ar nothing short of stunning, with hardly a misstep to be seen. The DVD is recommended as it features amazing picture and sound, with a bonus DTS mix thrown in, for those who have the capability of playback for this special audio format.",
