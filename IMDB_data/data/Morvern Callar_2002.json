        "reviewBody": "Ramsey's second film after the totally impressive Ratcatcher has an air of aimlessness about it. I haven't read the book but the film has only one idea: how does a girl behave when she finds her boyfriend dead with slashed wrists on the floor of their flat? Callar's response is almost post-contemporary - what happens here could simply never have been conceived of more than a few years ago. We follow Samantha Morton (as Callar) through subsequent hazy meanderings with her girlfriend. We assume she is in severe temporary shock at the tragedy - so the creeping suspicion that she is simply a half-wit is disappointing, though all the soft drugs confounds the issue. Life seems impoverished here, as if the city has sucked something out of people. Even death is meaningless.\n\nThe early part of the film looks dangerously like Catherine Breillat territory - the last thing we need is an original talent like Ramsey to start ripping people off - and I think she was only partly able to haul herself out of the Breillat groove. The tension lapses completely during the second half when Callar goes on holiday in Spain, and there is a silly scene when she meets publishers and passes herself off as the writer of her dead boyfriend's novel that we could have done without.\n\nOn the whole, very nicely executed though; a fine performance by Morton, a great and atmospheric opening, and some cool music including Aphex Twin make it worth watching. Pity there wasn't more to it."
