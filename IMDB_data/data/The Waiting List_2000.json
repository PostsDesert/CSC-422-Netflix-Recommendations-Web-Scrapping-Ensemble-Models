After finally getting through this (because the much more entertaining paint had dried throughout my house), I wouldn't be surprised if it's that high due to the cast and crew being told to bump it up. Painstaking conversations that go absolutely nowhere...acting that makes any elementary school Christmas play look like an award-winning masterpiece by comparison... The comedic timing of Police Academy 4. And those are the best things I can say about this school project. As far as the bad, well since I have to be at work Monday morning, I won't have enough time in the next 24 hours to list everything, starting with the non-stop whiny little sister that wants the whole world to feel sorry for her. But hey, at least they got a couple tokens in there so the producers, writers and director can pat themselves on the back for their diversity."
