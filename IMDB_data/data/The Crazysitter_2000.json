A women who gets kicked out of prison becomes the nannie of two bratty twins and decides to try and sell them after seeing a T.V. show about what a kid would be worth. It is possibly the worst movie ever made.I was just shocked at the stupidity and little effort put into the movie even by the title you can tell this movie isint going to be a good one."
