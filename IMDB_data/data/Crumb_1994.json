        "reviewBody": "After reading the couple of negative reviews of \"Crumb\" on IMDB I re - viewed the movie one more time just to make sure that the many times when I had seen this movie before, on the silver screen and on video, I have not been in a state of delusion. With the movie fresh in my mind I want to put out this message to all the people who have made depreciating statements such as \"what is Crumb moaning about, he's famous now\", \"the Sixties weren't really like that\", \"it was just two hours of whining, rambling and unjustified complaining\" etc. etc.: go back to your Kevin Costner, Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise big budget Oscar winners, and stop smearing dirt on one of the best documentaries ever made. So frigging what if it's shot with a hand - held camera and without studio lighting? \"Crumb\" is the real thing, it does not need any trickery or gloss. Basically it shows Robert Crumb, the artist famous for \"Keep On Truckin'\", \"Fritz The Cat\" (though he does not like to be associated with either of them) and \"Mr. Natural\", telling the story of his life through his wife and brothers, with a few scenes of him at a vernissage and a comic book store (etc.) thrown in for good measure. Call it a modern - day version of the van Gogh - story, or a look at the darker (or even just the non - Warner - Brothers) side of the flower - power generation, the human condition, the power of art, the battle of the sexes, a case history of mental illness, psychotic families, whatever. The story, and with it the film, is amazing and totally captivating. I have watched it many times and intend to watch it many times over. Give it a miss only if you expect some good, clean, family entertainment, but do so at your loss.",
