Growing up in the seventies (I turned eighteen and graduated High School the same year as this release), I was extremely aware of most of the social problems this film attempted to address: bigotry, racism, war, sexuality, drugs, and the \"What am I going to do with my life?\" syndrome that affected quite a few of us at this time. To the next generation studying their parents' adolescence: This is some of what we had to go through."
