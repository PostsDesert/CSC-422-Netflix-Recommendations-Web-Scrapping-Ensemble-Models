        "reviewBody": "Terry Gilliam's had a controversial career. His \"Brazil\" in 1985 upset Universal because it had a \"sad\" ending, so they cut it apart and replaced the finale with a \"happier\" version. Gilliam hated their hack job of his work, and illegally screened his original version for a critics' circle -- they voted it one of the best films of the year. Soon Gilliam got his way and the film was released as he had originally intended, and it's now considered a classic.\n\nA few years later he released \"The Adventures of Baron Manchusen,\" a fantasy flop that went some $20 million over budget and collapsed at the box office. He quit directing for a while and, when he returned, started work on \"Twelve Monkeys.\" It wasn't the best of shoots and his perfectionism resulted in eccentric, intolerable shooting schedules.\n\nIn 1998 \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" was released and the MPAA hated it, threatening to give it an X rating for its drug content. Released alongside \"Godzilla,\" it flopped, but to this day remains a cult classic.\n\nSo it's reasonable to say Gilliam is quite an eccentric personality and has had a tumultuous career.\n\n\"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\" was going to be his new film until it crashed. The production was halted because Gilliam couldn't find an actor to play Quixote, flash floods destroyed equipment and one of his shooting locations was in fact a NATO airfield which created quite a problem for the filmmakers.\n\nGilliam's film probably would have been a great twist on the classic tale and I'm sure his eccentric vision would have suited it well. He also had a cameo by Johnny Depp in the movie and it's quite funny as shown in this documentary detailing the events of the production.\n\nGilliam recently said he's going to start production on this again and finish it up. I hope so, it really does look like a promising film.\n\nIn terms of this documentary itself, it's very insightful and a must-see for any Gilliam fan or aspiring director -- it's entertaining and important, and a great guide on how NOT to make a movie.",
