        "reviewBody": "A brilliant man was Osamu Tezuka to come up with most likely the only \"medical thriller\" Japanese anime. Tezuka, considered to be the father of anime, put his medical degree into work with this series.\n\nDr. Black Jack is a surgeon. Not only a surgeon, but the best in the world. Many people come to him seeking medical attention, from a person's disfigured face to an unborn twin inside of a person. These people know that they are getting the best, yet they realize that they could be putting themselves at risk, because this man is not licensed to operate on them. Still, the many come, seeking his help, and paying him off in the millions.\n\nWhat drew me towards this series was the same reason many people are drawn to the show \"ER.\" Many different problems arise, in people's lives, and a very experienced surgeon is needed to cure them. When the patient is healed, the viewer gets a nice, happy, feeling inside of him.\n\nIf you are willing to try out a new anime, I urge you to pick up Black Jack. You may be disappointed, but at least you will be one of the few to see this great series."
