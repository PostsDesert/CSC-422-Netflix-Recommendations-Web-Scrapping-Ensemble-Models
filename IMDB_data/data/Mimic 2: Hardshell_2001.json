Brisk direction from Jean de Segonzac, impressive set design (rainy alleyways scrawled with neon graffiti and lit with primary colours), a few well executed creature effects and a touch of gore, and perhaps the most ludicrous (but very welcome) 'strip down to underwear' scene for a female lead since Saffron Burrows climbed out of her wetsuit in Deep Blue Sea, all go to ensure that Mimic 2's 82 minutes pass rather painlessly.",
