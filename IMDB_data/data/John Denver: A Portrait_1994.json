        "reviewBody": "How long must we wait for this wonderful piece of family entertainment? I watched this when it was first aired and hurried to buy the record, yes the old LP! Family members with children received records that year in November so they could enjoy the music before Christmas. Everyone in our family still loves this classic recording. I have worn out the LP, and two subsequent tapes as well. I even purchased the book of piano music! I now have a toddler granddaughter and would love to be able to share this holiday classic video with her. Is anyone pursuing this? Is there hope this will be available soon? I was a Best Buy today asking about the availability of this in DVD format and the clerk told me I was the 2nd person to ask about this video today."
