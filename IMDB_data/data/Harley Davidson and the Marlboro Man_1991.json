But critical faculties don't mean a thing when chemistry is as kinetic as that between Rourke and Johnson, who for my money have Newman and Redford beat by a mile in one of the best \"buddy\" teamings ever. Moreover, the movie is beautifully cast down the line and the pace is always great. Everything from the costuming of the lead characters to the atmosphere in the bar to the performances by Tom Sizemore and Daniel Baldwin are right on target. But mainly it's Johnson and Rourke's connection that makes the movie. They're terrific. I've seen this movie several times and it never loses me for an instant. Yeah!",
