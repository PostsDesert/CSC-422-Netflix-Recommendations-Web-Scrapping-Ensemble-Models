        "reviewBody": "\"Homicidal\" is a very strange movie. It's among the best of William Castle's gimmicky horror films, but unlike any of them. Fans of \"camp\" should have a field day with this one. Jean Arless plays a fascinating part, but her obvious disguises and stilted acting are sorely out of step with everyone else's naturalistic looks and behavior. However, the story is absorbing, clever and ultimately entertaining. Films that take their cue from \"Psycho\" normally make me bristle, but this time it's actually quite interesting to catch the references as they continue to pile up (There are so many). Would love to know what Hitchcock thought of this movie.",
