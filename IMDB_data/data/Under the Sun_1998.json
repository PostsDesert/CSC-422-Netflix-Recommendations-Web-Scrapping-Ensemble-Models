        "reviewBody": "\"Under the Sun\" is a bucolic, warm, charming, and sentimental story about a 40 year old Swedish farmer who hires an attractive housekeeper who tends to somewhat more than cooking and cleaning. He's illiterate with an inheritance, she's smart and pretty, and he has a young male friend who may be after both his money and the woman. A lovely bit of romantic melodrama laced with humor and rustic beauty which could steal your heart or make you gag depending on your taste. Recommended for more mature sentimentalists. (B)",
