A snotty, spoiled female reporter tags along as well. I had fun with this movie. Martial arts, sorcery, demons, lots of blood, and some nudity what more can one ask for? However, keep in mind that Director Ngai Kai Lam's films are an acquired taste. I personally loved \"Story of Ricky\" and \"Erotic Ghost Story\", and while this isn't nearly as good as those two. It's better then \"The Cat\" and is a fun way to kill an hour and a half.\n\nMy Grade: B- \n\nDVD Extras: Theatrical Trailer; Trailers for \"Wo zai hei she hui de ri zi\" (Triads the inside story), \"Jiang hu long hu men\" (flaming Brothers), \"Ba xing bao xi\" (Eighth Happiness) and \"Qi yuan\" (Witch from Nepal) \n\nEye Candy: Sau-Lai Tsui enters the film in a wet white see-thru number and shows everything and wow she's hot, oh and a few extras are topless fleetingly",

As a result, the cop is damned with seven \"Blood Curses\" which burst through his leg periodically. When the seventh bursts, he will die, but Betsy, the beauty he saved stops the curse with an antidote that lasts only one year, so on the advice of Wisely (Chow yun Fat) he heads back to Thailand to find a permanent cure. Action ensues as the cop and cohorts battle the evil sorcerer of the Worm Tribe, a hideous bloodthirsty baby like creature and \"Old Ancestor,\" a skeleton with glowing blue eyes that transforms into a monster that is a cross between Rodan and Alien.",
