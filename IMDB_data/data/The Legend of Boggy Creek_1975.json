        "reviewBody": "This film sparked a great interest in Bigfoot, and is definitely worth checking out. It is probably the best or most beloved movie on the subject, because it is done with a lot of heart, especially for Arkansas and the Texarkana area. The songs are also quite memorable, although they are definitely on the homespun side. The people are also very real, and the scares are equally authentic. Charles PIerce is actually a pretty good film maker, when he puts his mind to it (\"Winterhawk\" was also quite good). But the sequels are probably best avoided, unless you enjoy the comedy factor of bad films. Since viewing this film, my brothers and friends actually wanted to go find the Bigfoot. We also started a collection of books and literature on the subject. There are a number of documentaries on the creature, and those are worth seeking out. But if you want the definitive film, with a genuine love for the animal and his environs, get this one. Then watch out where you paddle, because \"he always travels the creeks..\""
