I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe film has loads going for it if what you're after is an entertaining, funny and visually stunning movie  we get Indiana Jones-style booby-trapped castles, sexy girl ninjas in leather mini-skirts, cool ninja-dudes in indestructible armour, beautiful female contortionist thieves, and baddies with fists of steel. The action is sufficiently over-the-top and everything is accompanied by a pounding techno soundtrack.\n\nWhat more could you ask for?",
