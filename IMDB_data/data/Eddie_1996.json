It's one of those unpretentious Whoopi Goldberg comedies that bring a smile to your face. Whoopi plays Eddie, a loud-mouthed New York Knicks fan who through dumb luck becomes head coach. Expect lots of cameos from real NBA players and wooden acting from those same players (There are many howlers by \"Preacher\" a.k.a. B-baller Mark Jackson). Overall, a pleasant diversion not meant for film snobs. 7/10",
