        "reviewBody": "Space Dancing takes our four skivvy wearing,children entertaining Aussies into the world of animation.There are songs and dances that the audience,children and adult alike,quickly become accustomed to.Fast paced with little time for boredom,The Wiggles ,accidently sent into space thanks to the bumbling yet loveable Captain Feathersword,are introduced to different planets and persons but left each place better than when they had arrived.The use of Rock and Roll legend Ross Wilson as King Mondo was a stroke of genius.Once again Eagle Rock hit the charts ,this time with The Wiggles as back-up. It is a fun story and one the pre-school to mid-elementary age will find most enjoyable.",
