Videos like \"Baby One More Time\", \"Sometimes\" look innocent, refreshing and yet mysteriously captivating. Videos from the next album already follow a more sexy style. Coupled with high budgets, the videos are visually appealing and attractive to watch. Recent videos are more varied in style, such as \"Everytime\", evolves around a theme she has not done before.\n\nIt is fun and entertaining to watch this collection of videos. With the pop/dance music to go along with it, it is hard to dislike this video!"
