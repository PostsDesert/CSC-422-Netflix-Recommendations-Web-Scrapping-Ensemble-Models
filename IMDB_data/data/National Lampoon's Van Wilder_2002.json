Yet people for some reason actually pay money to see these films. I've started to enter my pompous intellectual phase, yet I still have a big weakness for teen movies.\n\nAnimal house, Ferris, Weird Science, Bachelor Party and more recently a resurgence with American Pie, Road Trip, Have the Cow and Van Wilder.\n\nAll of these films are great, IMO. Sure they are predictable, a bit cliché, sometimes gross and certainly a bit childish, but they are bloody funny. The only rule for a comedy is to be funny. I guess that if we are honest that period of our lives should be best. At least you have the innocence and optimism to know your life is all in front of you and getting laid and having fun, is pretty much the only thing on your mind (that hasn't changed if we are honest).\n\nI am disappointed that so many people criticise a film that clearly wasn't meant to be taken too seriously and is genuinely funny. Great stuff please may it continue.",
