        "reviewBody": "Walter Matthau playing the title role of Charley Varrick expected a few thousand dollars as the score in a small town bank in New Mexico. It was a costly robbery in human terms with only Matthau and hotheaded Andy Robinson who survive out of the original team of four.\n\nImagine their surprise when they discover what they've got is three quarters of a million dollars. It turns out the bank was a laundering operation for Syndicate money and they're not the forgiving kind even if he was so inclined to return the money.\n\nUnder Don Siegel's direction, Matthau turns in one of his best film performances as the wily bank robber who keeps a cool head in a very tricky situation. Matthau plays beautifully against Robinson who's everything Matthau's not in terms of brains and self control.\n\nMatching Matthau is the syndicate cleanup man Joe Don Baker who's also a shrewd man with a very suspicious nature. That comes with the territory of Baker's job, still he's got a streak of meanness in him as well. Matthau and Baker are an evenly matched pair. What I especially love about Charley Varrick is how Matthau uses Baker's own suspicions against him in the end. Beautifully written and beautifully played.\n\nIf you liked the gritty realism of a film like The Asphalt Jungle you will definitely like Charley Varrick.",
