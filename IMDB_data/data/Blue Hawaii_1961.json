        "reviewBody": "While this is an O.K. film is most respects, sadly this turned out to be the route which Elvis's later film followed. Elvis is always likable in films like these, but when you've seen most of his later movies, you find out that they all follow a similar formula and it's hard to distinguish them from one another. Here, Elvis playes the same role as he did in practically every film after this one; a charming, womanising lad who happens to sing well. I should however note that I haven't seen all of his 33 films, but I've seen like 20 or so. Blue Hawaii is fondly remembered because of it's beautiful music and terrific scenery (Hawaii always looks enchanting). It's quite a lovely scene when Elvis sings \"Can't help falling in love\" to the old lady. Who wouldn't be charmed by that? 6 out of 10.",
