        "reviewBody": "I stumbled across this flick on late night TV while it was well into the movie and got intrigued by its tone and flavor. I later had to seek it out so I could see the entire thing. I found it a REALLY good watch. Some people will really hate it though. It isn't a movie for everyone. It is rather dark and brooding, and maybe even a little depressing. The humor is black and it deals with unclear emotions and psychology. Dan Futterman does a great job with his character and it was a pleasant surprise to learn that he had some real acting talent under his boyish looks. His character, Charlie, is suffering a kind of breakdown from grief, guilt and rage. The movie basically deals with how he functions daily and about the strangeness of the others and events of the city around him. Watching his personal journey and his transformation is certainly worth the time and money you will spend on the rental.",
