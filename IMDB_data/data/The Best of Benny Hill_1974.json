        "reviewBody": "I can't say I'm a big fan of Benny Hill. I do however like him and his sense of humor. There's a big difference between Benny Hill and Adam Sandler. Both don't use sophisticated humor , yet Hill never was so vulgar like Sandler. His comedy was always lighthearted , cartoonish in style , but always enjoyable. In some ways he continued humor that was evident in silent era movies. Benny Hill was a classic comedian and I doubt that even the most stuck up person haven't laughed at least once at one of Hill's jokes.\n\nWhat we have here isn't really a movie , but more of a collection of jokes from \"The Benny Hill show\". It's similar to Monty Python's \"And now for something completely different\". There is no plot here , just longer or shorter jokes. The whole movie is short ( not even 1 hour 30 minutes) and fast paced.\n\nI'm not quite short is this is really the best of. The level of the jokes is uneven. Some jokes are rather unfunny and boring – The musical in boutique , the Chinese guy at airport , boring song \"Garden of love\" , \"Passengers of love\" , The life of Maurice Dribbe The jokes also have tendency to repeat themselves . I mean how many times does Hill dress up as woman here ?\n\nThankfully most of the jokes are good. Some even are brilliant – parody of TV commercials , parody of interview with French movie director , training in the gym , evening with Tommy Tupper or the hospital bit.\n\nFor every fan of Benny Hill it's a must see. Those who are mildly interested in Hill or just looking for good comedy should check it out too. I give it 7/10.",
