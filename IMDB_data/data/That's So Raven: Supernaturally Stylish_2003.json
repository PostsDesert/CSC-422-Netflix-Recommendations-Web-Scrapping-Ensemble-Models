It's an original show, I'll definitely give them that.\n\nBut some parts make me shudder. Anneliese van der Pol, who plays Chelsea, was funny and fairly witty, if naive, in the first season. But as the show progressed, she became steadily stupider. It started out as a funny sort of stupidity, but at this point in the show you start to wonder what toxic fumes she has inhaled.\n\nAll in all, though, it's pretty amusing. Not something I'm going to go racing to the TV for, screaming 'That's So Raven is on! I MUST WATCH IT!', but something that's good for a chuckle when you stumble upon it."
