Special effects consist of lots of fake blood, a bad monster costume, and Krista Allen -Moritt's breasts. Monster looks like it walked straight off the set of SPECTRAMAN (old precursor to POWER RANGERS), including monster noises those TV producers would have been embarrassed to dub (they sound like someone after a bad bowl of chili). \n\nThe channeling/dream scenes are particularly stupid, and the chase scenes, such as they are, are beyond boring - my vocabulary fails me at this point.\n\nWill make MST3k some day, if MST3k survives.",
