My favorite part was when it ended, and we got to see all the bloopers, and it really wasn't that much different from the rest of the movie. Did anybody notice the token black kid who had no lines? Mary Kate and Ashley are racists. Oh and by the way, This was borderline kiddie porn, because it showed underage girls in a bathroom. Gross. And metal mouth (the \"villain\") kept forgetting her lines, not that you could pay attention to what she was saying when you were blinded by the glare coming off her JAWS like teeth. This movie would have been better with drugs.",
