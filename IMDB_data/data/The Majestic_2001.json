        "reviewBody": "Anyone who saw Frank Capra's movies and particularly \"Mr Smith goes to Washington\" when James Stewart single -handedly fights the powers that be in the courtroom will see the connection.\"The majestic\" is old cinema ,it's a fable that should not be taken seriously.It pays a tribute not only to Frank Capra but also to Tornatore's \"Cinema paradisio\" (1988) and to Homer in Wyler's \"best years of our lives\"(1945),and also to great movies of the past such as Vidor's \"the big parade\"(1925) (When Carey watches Renée Adorée saying farewell to her true love,it makes a parallel between her affair and Adèle and the true \"Trumble\") or Wise's \"the day the earth stood still\" .It even shows -perhaps ironically in that context- a poster of Kazan's \"a streetcar named desire\"!\n\nAnyone who wants to take it literally will totally miss the point;it did not prevent \"it's a wonderful life\" and \"Mr Smith goes to Washington to go straight to the heart;so does \"the majestic \" :it has a good screenplay which is never boring during 140 min and which features very good ideas:The hero remembering the lines of Dieterle 's \"life of Emile Zola\" whereas he suffers from amnesia ,the piano boogie which shocks the old music teacher,the way Landau reveals the young man the \"truth\" in the little graveyard,and how -always the magic of cinema\" he recovers his memory...The first part is Martin Landau's triumph:he will move you to tears ;Tornatore's influence again,he really seems to come from \"cinema paradisio\" .But Jim Carrey in a sober part can succeed in his James Stewartesque act as well. Some will tell you it's passé,corny ,old hat :they are completely right.This movie can only appeal to these who have often a look at the past of the seventh art:I'm one of them and I do like \"the majestic\"."
