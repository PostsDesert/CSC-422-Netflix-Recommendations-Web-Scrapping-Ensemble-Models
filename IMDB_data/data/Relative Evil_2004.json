        "reviewBody": "\"Relative Evil\" is a tough movie to describe. The story of a teen's turbulent reintegration back home after a stint in rehab, it's pitched somewhere between gritty family drama, twisty suspense and camp-infused black comedy. I actually found the tonal messiness intriguing: it's certainly not like any other coming-of-age film or addiction drama I've seen. The movie looks a good bit better than most independent films of the time, despite the lighting being too dark in some scenes.\n\nAlthough unfocused at times, I was won over by the unusual plot and strong cast, particularly Jonathan Tucker, Ethan Embry and Jennifer Tillly. Fans of Tilly should take special note, as she provides a deliciously eccentric performance as the amoral and cruel Aunt Dot, who will stop at nothing to cause her nephew's demise."
