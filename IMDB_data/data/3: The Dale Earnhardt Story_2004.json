        "reviewBody": "This movie will likely get good viewership because it was heavily marketed, but it made too many assumptions about Dale's life. They did not do enough research prior to releasing this movie. Many, many important parts are left out, and it felt extremely disjointed and rushed. Often, I was saying, \"oh, I guess they are moving on to the next thing.\" The ending was terrible and did not delve into an important part about how he became who he is today. Trust me, many non-Nascar folks realized a lot after his death. I am a racing fan, and I think many who love Dale Earnhardt will be afraid to admit that this movie was terrible. I hope some are not afraid. I do not think Formula One would ever allow such a poor movie about their superstar such as a Senna or a Schumacher. I give this 1.5 out of 5 stars. A big shame."
