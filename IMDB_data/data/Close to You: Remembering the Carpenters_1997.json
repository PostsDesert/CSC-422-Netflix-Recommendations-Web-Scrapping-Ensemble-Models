        "reviewBody": "This PBS TV special chronicles the Carpenters legacy for the 14 years they were with A&M Records, and the course that was charted getting there. Richard Carpenter is very candid and open about Karen's anorexia, and even about his own chemical dependency problem in 1978. The show touches only very very briefly about his own solo career after Karen's death, which is sad because so few people are keenly aware of Richard's huge role in the Carpenters' success. Bonus materials include commercials for both candy and soda in the Orient and potato chips in Texas, an additional half hour of material not seen in the program, and their Nixon White House performance. Highly recommended for any Carpenters fan.",
