And they probably should be, as they are generally sentimental, unrealistic fluff. But this is one of those rare good ones. Is it sentimental? Yes. Unrealistic? Yes. Fluff? Yes. But it really cemented Sandra Bullock as America's Sweetheart, and may be her finest role. Well, this and \"Speed\". She is going as strong as ever twenty years later, and it should be no surprise.\n\nPeter Gallagher is a bit off, but Bill Pullman really succeeds as a romantic interest. Odd, but he does it. And the supporting cast is excellent, from Peter Boyle to... well, everyone.",
