        "reviewBody": "When I decided to see this movie, I was under the impression that it was an action movie. After about 5 minutes I was convinced that this had to be a comedy. Stupid one-liners like \"We're warriors, we can't be held to the normal standard\", or \"No regret, only honor\" made me certain that it was. I could not believe that anyone would make a movie like this, without it being a comedy. I first thought it was a good comedy, very subtle and not too slapstick.\n\nThen it started dawning on me. It wasn't actually funny, just stupid. I checked back to imdb.com to see, and it being listed as an action movie, and not a comedy, was probably the funniest thing about it.\n\nFrom the ludicrous (Adj. \"Laughable or hilarious because of obvious absurdity or incongruity.\") camera-angles to the boring and unoriginal plot, over to the choreography that has to had been done by a couple of monkeys, this movie was sheer torture to watch, and I feel that my time on this earth is valuable, and not worth wasting on filth like this.\n\n It is a waste of time and money, unless you feel like watching a good example of how NOT to make a movie.\n\nAfter watching movies like Hard Boiled, The Killer, Saving Private Ryan, and the mini-series called Band of Brothers, you would think that the standards of action-scenes had been raised, above this stereotypical nonsense which is closer to the early 80s low-budget era.\n\nFinally, I just have to mention this; what was with all those swoosh-sounds? A guy raises an arm and you hear a swoosh-sound, like a big log has been swung past your ear. What the heck?! Same thing when a guy gets into a car, or someone turns around. Stupid stupid stupid.\n\nI could probably point out dozens of examples of how this movie is both unbelievably unrealistic and stupid, but quite frankly, I think I've wasted enough time on this crap."
