She wasn't very excited about Russian cinema, she isn't a film person and hates to read subtitles, but this time she gave in.\n\nAs many reviewers mentioned before, majority of the humor relies on the verbal misunderstandings between the characters from different time eras, that of 1500's and that of 1970's.\n\nI've paused the film no less than a dozen times to explain such details as the meaning of world \"liapota,\" it being the ancient word for the modern equivalent of \"beauty,\" and to explain Visotskii's (a Russian singer whom Ivan the Terrible listens) lyrics. Also, there are many little social comments that those who haven't lived in, visited, or studied Soviet Union wouldn't understand completely i.e. the obvious ridicule of the \"social reports\" and the black market commentary.\n\nNevertheless, she liked it, and I was dumbfounded.\n\nThis film is popular and remembered because of its many layers. You may enjoy it simply as slapstick, someone else can view it for the language, while yet others can view it as a social commentary. It adds up if you know the Russian language and history, but even if you don't you will still find it funny and charming because there is always something to take away."
