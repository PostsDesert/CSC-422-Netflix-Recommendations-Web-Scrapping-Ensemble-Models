        "reviewBody": "Shogun is the story of an English pilot shipwrecked in Japan and the first Englishman to arrive there. The story is based fairly closely on the life of William Adams to whom most of the events in the film happened to and did in fact become the only non japanese ever to become a samauri. He also became a minor daimyo and Japan's first Admiral. He may have well been a deciding factor in tiping the balance of power that let the Shogunate become as powerful as it did to rule as long as it did. One of my favourite things about the story on video is that it is about half english and half japanese. With no subtitles. As John Blackthorne (the name given the main character in the story) is struggling with the japanese so is the viewer. (I have also used it to help improve my japanese which is very limited).\n\nThe story is fast moving and fasinating. I read the book in three days and couldn't wait for the mini-series if I have an entire day to relax I will sometimes watch the entire 549 minutes of the show. As I said it is my all time favourite program"
