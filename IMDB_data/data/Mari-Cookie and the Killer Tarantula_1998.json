        "reviewBody": "Killer Barbies (1996) was a half decent film (thanks to the band of the same name and Santiago Segura) but even then one could see that Senor Franco was starting to lose his touch. Since then his films have become exponentially worse. Everything that fans liked about Franco movies has been thrown out. All that is left is an Indecipherable mess of gawky ex-scream queens, awful Subterfuge grunge music and pathetic product placement (T-shirts, posters on the wall, etc), cheapo video effects, flacid nude scenes and some very poor acting. No knew Howard Vernons to be found here, I'm afraid, and as for a Soledad Miranda - forget it. \"Mari-Cookie and the Killer Tarantula\" is not barely watchable - its totally unwatchable."
