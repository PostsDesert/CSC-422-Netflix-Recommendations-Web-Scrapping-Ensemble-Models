        "reviewBody": "I never watched Space Ghost when it used to air, probably because I literally didn't know what I was missing (why I didn't watch it I can't remember, maybe it was on too late or it just seemed like the guests were sometimes unknowns to me, even as this wasn't the case at all). Now on DVD, I was curious to see it as part of other old shows from Cartoon Network. Seeing it now, it's... everything that's fun and smart in a really throwaway-joke kind of way in a cartoon when taking itself perfectly un-seriously. It's a spoof on old 60s cartoons, late night talk shows, hubris, rivalries, and many other things. Space Ghost and Zorak make for a great duo, with the other guy (can't remember his name now, the masked 'director' who sometimes sings if forced to in Zorak's absence) a notable third wheel, even as they're often ready to rip at each other's throats. The comedy is brilliant without even really trying, though I'm sure the writers worked their heads off to get certain scenes down (other times... you can tell they just chucked stuff at the wall, and I mean that as a compliment oddly enough). The writing basically makes up for the obvious goof-factor of the animation, which is repetitive and might just be ripped off of the 60s Space Ghost show (where else will I hear a line like \"You smell like a farm!\"), and it's probably one of the best ludicrous-type programs the Cartoon Network ever had. It's only my loss I didn't track down this crazy piece of work sooner, or watch it when it originally aired.",
