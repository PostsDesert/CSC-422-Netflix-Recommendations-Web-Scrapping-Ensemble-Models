        "reviewBody": "If you love Michael Moore documentaries and anti-GMO and anti-nuclear power documentaries you will love this one. It's an anti big-company, anti free market, anti trade documentary. They do actually interview a single actual professional economy expert but only for 3 minutes.\n\nThe rest of the interviews are with \"they took ur jobs!\"-workers and journalists. Still a good watch if you already have a great understanding of how economics and mathematics work. Read at least 10 economics books before watching this to understand the true science and what trade does and does not do. Trade is not always bad. And stopping import of steel to protect steel-unions like Bush did is both illegal and stopping scientific and economic progress.",
