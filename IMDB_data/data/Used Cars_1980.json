        "reviewBody": "I distinctly remember this movie because in the summer of 1980 I was travelling across the United States, and only had time to see one movie of the three big budgeted comedies that hit the theatres that year.\n\nThe comedies that year were; 1) \"Airplane,\" 2) \"Used Cars\" and 3) \"How to beat the High Cost of Living.\" I went and saw film 3, and have regretted not seeing \"Used Cars\" in the theatre to this day. Some four or five years later when it hit Home Box Office (HBO) I thought I'd die laughing, and was kicking myself even harder for not seeing Robert Zemeckis' film in the theatre some five years before!\n\n\"Airplane\" took the box office that summer with all of its cheap gags, and \"How to Beat the High Cost of Living\" spawned the popular \"Kate and Ally\" TV series. Unfortunately \"Used Cars\" faded into the background, but saw a well earned and much deserved revival courtesy an HBO airing and home video sales.\n\n\"Used Cars\" is the comedy those two other films wanted to be, but couldn't. \"Used Cars\" is a better film with funnier material, better story, more action, and more heart, and will always be remembered as the quintessential 1980's comedy.\n\nYou must see \"Used Cars,\" but be cautioned, it's NOT a family comedy. There's lots of swearing, a few strippers, and other \"adult\" references. Even so, in my personal opinion, it is the funniest film made to date. ENJOY! :-)"
