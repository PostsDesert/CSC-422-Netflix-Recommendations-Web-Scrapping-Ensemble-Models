This is an idea that was probably absorbed by the dance public quite a while ago and I, for one, am not anxious to hear it again. And yet, this video drums it into our heads repeatedly while showing the brutality of the \"Etoile\" (star) survival-of-the-fittest system.\n\nI also fail to see why so much is made of Bejart's work. And especially since the \"Ninth Symphony\", admittedly not a ballet but more of a \"circus\" in my opinion, is set to Beethoven's music. For some reason, Beethoven, for all his greatness, seems to be one of the least danceable composers to ever be choreographed. Maybe his actual ballet music like \"The Creatures of Prometheus\" might be done more successfully.\n\nTo me, the Kylian section is more interesting.\n\nI found this video to be quite tedious despite some passing pleasures along the way. No doubt it would be of greater interest to dancers and ballet fans.",
