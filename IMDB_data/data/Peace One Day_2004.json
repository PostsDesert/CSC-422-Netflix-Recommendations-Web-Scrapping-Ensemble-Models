        "reviewBody": "This is a very well-made documentary. Jeremy is not just a skillful political activist, he really knows how to make a good movie. You will definitely be drawn in to his struggle to create a global ceasefire for one day each year. If this film doesn't inspire you to take political action, nothing will. The story is one about an ordinary person (who happens to be a minor movie-maker) who decides to do something to change the world. His quest takes him around the world to the conflict hot-spots such as in Africa and the middle east, to schools around the world, to visit religious leaders like the Dalai Lama, and to meetings with world leaders and the United Nations (in a borrowed suit and last-minute haircut). Seeing him get ordinary Palestinians and Israelis together in a room discussing their desires for peace, or listening to the young people in Africa arguing about whether it will work, was a nice touch. Of course, the real ending to this movie depends on what political actions YOU take after you watch it. A global ceasefire can't exist unless you join the protest to force governments to do it.",
