        "reviewBody": "Just caught this movie on TV late last night. Despite not having seen the first Hyderabad Blues, I have to say that the film gave me a new vision of the social lives of contemporary middle-class Indians. The plot was quite tedious - focusing on one guy's indiscretions with a work colleague and his fianc√©e's subsequent soul searching over whether to take him back - and the characters were mostly a bunch of macho, unsympathetic yuppies, but the acting was on the whole quite natural, and the film didn't glamourise the petty events of these people's lives. It surprised me to see an Indian movie, made for Indian audiences, presented in a realistic way. Maybe this isn't such an odd thing for an Indian viewer, but for someone whose main exposure has been to subtitled Bollywood musicals or sanitised Westernised productions (think 'Monsoon Wedding'), it was quite novel to hear such casual swearing and vulgar talk from both men and women.",
