        "reviewBody": "I wanted to like this film and some parts of it, I did. However, over all I found the movie a major disappointment. The film was filled with stereotype characters; the dedicated lifer who needs to train \"his boys\" so they can survive the war in Viet-Nam: the soldier with two left hands who ends up winning the medal of honor: the journalist who is a hippie jack-ass: and the hero who is hated by his father-in-law, yet marries his daughter, but gets killed in Viet-Nam. As is typical in almost every Hollywood movie about the military, 99% of it is pure bull. James Caan was his typical angry, hot headed, over emotional character that he played in most of his movies. After awhile, his yelling gives you a headache. I am sorry, but Gardens of Stone is a badly acted and greatly disappointing movie.",
