        "reviewBody": "The Gorge is one of the Dave Matthews Band's better live performances. It features many classic songs such as Grey Street, Ants Marching, What Would You Say, Tripping Billies, and Halloween which is rarely played live. Other songs that can't be found on studio albums such as Seek Up and Loving Wings which are great songs in their own right.\n\nOne element that makes it such a great video to watch is where the concert takes place. The band plays at the Gorge Amphitheatre in the state of Washington. This is one of the most beautiful places in the United States. The scenery combined with the talented band makes for a excellent performance.\n\nIn addition to the songs there are 3 intervals between the songs. In the intervals are documentaries featuring the band at the Gorge. It shows the fans and gets in depth with the music crew as well. One of the documentaries also shows the making of the music video for the song Grace Is Gone. The music video is also on the DVD.\n\nIf you are Dave Matthews Band fan then I would recommend this DVD. If you haven't listened to DMB before this will make you a fan. It is a great buy for people that enjoy great music.",
