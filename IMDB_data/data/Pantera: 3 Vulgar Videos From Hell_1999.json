There was a lot of really funny stuff about everyone, plus they had behind the scenes of all their music videos. They also had live footage of their concerts which was amazing. They really rocked hard. Most of it was just them being flat out silly and crazy. I really enjoyed watching this movie with my friends. We laughed so hard the entire time! I suggest it to everyone and anyone. Even if you're not a fan, you'll enjoy the silliness of all the guys. the package!!!",
