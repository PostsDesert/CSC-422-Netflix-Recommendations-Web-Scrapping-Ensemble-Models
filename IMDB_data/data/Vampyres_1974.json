        "reviewBody": "Murder, mystery, and a soft-core vampire lesbian scene, all in the first sixty seconds. Alright, I'm just going to say it right here and now, I'm giving this one a ten. Our story begins in a dark, eerie castle in England. Inside, two hot ladies are loving on each other, the party is soon spoiled, by a mysterious figure, who shoots them dead. Now, after the title, we get the idea that it's years later, and for whatever reason, the hot ladies, Fran and Miriam, are now hot vampyres, hot vampyres who hitch rides on the side of the country road, only to lure their victims back to their lair, in the castle, to be loved on, and of course, to be drained of all blood. We got sex scenes, bloody, erotic killings, Pleasant, country scenery, and some more sex scenes, I do believe this is my all-time favorite British Horror film. Vampyres is amazing on many different levels. Our two leading ladies, are portrayed brilliantly by Marianne Morris and Anulka Dziubinska, and the subtle score is positively haunting. In this film, the atmosphere rules, it really feels like you're witnessing a dream, at least on VHS it does, not so much on DVD. That roaring sound, along with the overcast sky is just captivating. Yet another fine example of a low-budget adding to the horror vibe. One of the many problems with todays horror is that they lay everything out for you, leaving nothing for the imagination, that is not the case with Vampyres, if anything, they leave out too much, several occurrences are never explained at all, which, would probably irritate most, but if looked at it the right way, should just keep you on your toes. Ultimately, Vampyres is just beautiful, grim horror for true fans of the genre, which also happens to include some really decent sex scenes. Especially recommended to those who prefer their horror dark and hot. Jess Franco never did anything half this good. 10/10",
