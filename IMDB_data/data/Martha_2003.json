        "reviewBody": "The director Georges Gachot has a delightful and stylish gab with the great Argentinean pianist Martha Argerich entwined with wonderful excerpts of her presentations and rehearsals. Along the conversation in French and English, Martha discloses parts of her culturally wealthy life since she was a lonely student in Europe and I particularly loved the description of her \"transgression\" when she calls off a concert just to experience the sensation, and then she cuts her own finger to justify the cancellation. In addition to the 63 minutes running time of this classy DVD, there are 38 minutes of concerts and rehearsals of Martha Argerich in the Extras. In accordance with the information in the cover of the DVD, this documentary was awarded with the followings prizes: Prix Italia 2002 (Documentary on Music and the Arts); Golden Prague 2002 (Czech Crystal for Best Documentary & Best Film Students Jury); Premio Asolo (Per La Sezione Biografia D' Artista 2003); and Unesco 2002 (Prix \"Citation Musique\" 26eme Festival Intl. du Film d'Art et PÃ©dagogique). My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Martha Argerich, Conversa Noturna\" (\"Martha Argerich, Conversation Nocturne\")",
