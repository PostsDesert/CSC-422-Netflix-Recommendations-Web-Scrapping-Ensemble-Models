        "reviewBody": "As I have said many times I have always loved the Disney sing along series for the entertainment and educational value it brings. Enchanted Tea Party is not quite one of the best of the series, mainly I wasn't crazy about Where Dreams Begin, I loved the introduction but it was too fast-paced and doesn't sound like a song that a Disney princess would sing. Other than that, the animation is beautiful, there is a very entertaining karaoke feature that will delight anybody and the music is wonderful. Other than When Dreams Begin, the weakest song featured is Forget About Love, mostly for Gilbert Gottfried's painful singing. For a Moment fares much better, it is easily the best song from Little Mermaid 2, which I don't care for because its bland villainess and rehashed story minus the charm, and is very well sung. However, there are several classics here, Someday My Prince Will Come, Kiss the Girl and So This is Love is the very definition of enchanting and romantic, and I Wonder, Something There and Just Around the Riverbend are equally great. All in all, an enchanting video. 9/10 Bethany Cox",
