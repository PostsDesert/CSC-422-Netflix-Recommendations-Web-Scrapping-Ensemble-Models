Clumsy and inexperienced, he makes mistakes in front of his commanding officer Commander Taylor (Don Ameche) and his crush, sailing instructer Kate Fairchild (Stefanie Powers.) Enter three bumbling jewel thieves attempting to flee to Mexico led by Harry Simmons (Phil Silvers) and Tom may just have been given the opportunity to prove himself as an effective and capable Coast Guardsman. I really like The Boatniks first of all because of how fun it is. Moreover, I like all these characters and there's plenty of good running gags. Check it out.",
