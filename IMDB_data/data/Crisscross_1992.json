        "reviewBody": "Slow paced as mentioned in another comment like a sleepy summer afternoon, the depiction of life in Key West in the late 60's rings true. It isn't polished and glitzy or glamorous. You can see this play out in your life or the life of friends.\n\nthe film centers around young David Arnott in the title role. The awkwardness and naturalism works in making it more real.\n\nIf you are looking for whizbang Hollywood value type of action here, this isn't the place. what you get is a true to life drama that can happen anywhere, at any place. David's moral choices are based on how he sees things as a real kid.\n\nAs a movie, it works well.",
