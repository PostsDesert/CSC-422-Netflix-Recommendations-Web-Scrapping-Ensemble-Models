Martin Short is basically one of the highlights of the movie...his accent is so weird and funny that you have to love him. Steve Martin was also good, and I liked his reactions to everything. Overall, the flick was better than the first one, and cute. But after awhile, Steve Martin gets a bit annoying with his obsessing over the pregnant women."
