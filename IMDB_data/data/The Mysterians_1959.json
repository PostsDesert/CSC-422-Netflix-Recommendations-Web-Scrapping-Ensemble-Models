NONE! Although \"The Mysterians\" uses some logical lapses to make the invaders clearly the bad guys (just WHY did they send the giant robot BEFORE attempting peaceful coexistance) and progresses WAY too quickly to its rousing finale (the world had these plans for superweapons just laying around), \"The Mysterians\" is an exciting, entertaining addition to any one's collection of \"space invader movies.\" Well photographed, beautifully scored, decently executed (for the 50s) special effects\" and freshly conceived, \"The Mysterians\" is better, in many ways than later films such as \"Independance Day\" and \"V\". Too bad Toho didn't make it longer and make a sequel (though it appears, that's what \"Battle in Outer Space\" was originally supposed to be.) See it.",
