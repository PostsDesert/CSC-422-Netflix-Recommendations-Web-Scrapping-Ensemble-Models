This film is just plain bad. Don't even waste the cost of a rental and your time to see the first few minutes, when you will be certain you've made a mistake.\n\nWe tried to give this film a chance, on the strength of Iron Monkey, but in the end it is just awful. The direction is terrible, the fight scenes are dull--trying to be exciting--the acting is either flat or over the top, the film editing makes it impossible to follow the story, and the film quality is miserable.\n\nEnough said? In other words, rent something else tonight."
