        "reviewBody": "This was surprisingly a great OVA! I didn't have high hopes for it, but I was pleasantly surprised. The first episode is about when this scientist guy wants to turn Lina into a Chimera, and she doesn't want too. The plot is very funny. The second episode is about a wimpy boy named Jeffery, who's mom wants him to become a knight. So she hires Lina and Naga to make him think that he's a brave knight. At first the episode seemed pretty bad, but I ended up enjoying it as the episode moved forward. The third, and best episode is about when Lina and Naga are searching for a thief who stole a magical mirror that can create clones of whoever stands before it. One problem though. The clone has a totally different personality than the actual person. This episode was the most epic. It had insert songs, and was the most funny. I say, if your a Slayers fan, you will most likely like this. Both voice tracks are good, however, if you mostly watch the series, be warned Lina's voice is different. Good, but different, and it will take some getting used too. 9/10",
