I loved the movie and I even owned the soundtrack.\n\nAt forty-four, I have heard the Beatles, seen the fall of the BeeGees and seen the stubborn persistence of an almost geriatric Aerosmith. They are indeed the \"Future Villain Band\".\n\nLove the Beatles? You will hate this movie. Interested in a simpler time when the hair of rock stars sits in a quiet mass atop the head as if waiting to attack (check out Barry Gibb...or is it Maurice?)? Interested in hearing music that you grew up with and loved torn to pieces by dupes of producers that no longer cared if what they made was good...only profitable? Then, this is the movie for you as well...\n\nSongs done well: Come Together, Got to Get You into My Life, Strawberry Fields and I'll Never Do You No Harm...\n\nSongs that didn't stink: Lucy in the Sky, You never Give me Your Money and A Day in the Life...\n\nSongs that were killed and the corpses urinated upon: When I'm Sixty-four, Fixing a Hole, Mister Mustard and Because...",
