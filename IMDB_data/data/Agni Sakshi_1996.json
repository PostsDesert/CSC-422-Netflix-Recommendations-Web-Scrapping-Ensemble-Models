        "reviewBody": "This was indeed the remake of Julia Robert's starrer Sleeping with the Enemy but then also it's really well made movie.\n\nThe story is plain and simple. A woman Madhu(Manisha Koirala) is married to Vishwanath (Nana Patekar). Vishwanath is highly obsessive and controlling husband, a bit of a psycho. Madhu fakes her own death and finds Suraj and marries him(Jackie Shroff). Vishwanath finds Madhu and then the drama starts.\n\nNana Patekar is absolutely amazing in the role of Vishwanath. Basically its like tailor made role for him and he finds himself comfortable in such role. Manisha Koirala is extemely convincing as Madhu and Shivangi and is able to bring out different shades. Jackie shroff is superb in his role.\n\nThe movie is actually Nana Patekar and Manisha Koirala's show all the way and there is hardly any other thing to notice. Yes, there is Jackie Shroff and he does really well.\n\nDirector Partho Ghosh has handled the story well and the narrative is fluent. There is hardly a dull moment in the movie and the drama is treated like a well made thriller.\n\nMusic of this movie is simply brilliant.",
