The man is crazy but his performance is excellent!\n\nJennifer Connely (being 16 at the time) delivers a solid and tender performance. She was very, very cute and her performance totally gained the audience's love. \n\nThe tale is fantastic and keeps you interested from the beginning to the end. The musical moments are also great! The f/x were great for it's time and I wonder how they came out with the idea for creating such original characters. \n\nThe thing that I liked the most about the movie is it's art direction. The world that is created is taken directly from everyone's fantasy world idea. Colorful and dark at the same time.\n\nBetter than the \"Neverending Story\" movies, \"Labyrinth\" should be watched for lovers of sci-fi.",
