        "reviewBody": "Does the heart listen? Just follow your heart and avoid conflict (easier said than done)...that is up to debate.\n\nI liked Aamir and Pooja, I saw this during early 90s. Another reason why I miss the 90s. I could write a Thesis on why the 1990s were the best time for Indian cinema.\n\nA magical time in Indian cinema. Pooja Bhatt was the only honest and real actress around, now they all try to be all that and then some. Sorry girls there is only one Pooja Bhatt and she is still fabulous.\n\nThere is a song that my dad recorded on a song tape...(I had my own collection). The one I am referring to is when Pooja's character is singing about her boyfriend and Aamir's is singing about his imaginary girlfriend.\n\nAll the songs are poetry put to music and they are the soul of the film. All Bhatt productions are very soulful. That is what makes them special.\n\nThe song where they conflict is the best because it demonstrates how complex love can be. Pooja's character does not want to change her mind...Aamir's character is aware of her situation and yet he does not willing to give up. Singing about emotions is the best form of expression. Music is great but words are clear and direct.\n\nPooja Bhatt is too young and too talented as an artist to sit behind the camera. I loved all her movies. I also liked reading her interviews when I was younger.\n\nAamir Khan is perfection that continues today...Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan are also very good actors in the work that they do.\n\nEveryone knows my favorite is Shah Rukh Khan ever since the 1998 Awesome Foursome concert.",
