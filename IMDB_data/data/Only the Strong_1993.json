It might not be a gritty urban drama that deals sensitively with youth and alienation in high school, but then neither was \"Heathers\".\n\nCinema primarily exists to entertain, and \"Only The Strong\" does this in spades. Dacascos is the most graceful, watchable martial arts star since Brandon Lee, with an easy charisma that really comes across in a film like this and also the brilliant \"Drive\". The rest of the cast perform quite nicely as well. The plot and characterisation are admittedly 2-D, but what the hell, it's a 100% schmaltz-free feelgood movie.\n\nTwo of my friends actually took up Capoeira after watching this film. How's that for life-changing?",
