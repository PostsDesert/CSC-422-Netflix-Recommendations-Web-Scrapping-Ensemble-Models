        "reviewBody": "Having followed the Batman Beyond show since its series premiere, this was a good spinoff. The cast was excellent, especially Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, and the plot was well done. Plus we get the futuristic Gotham City. It's very much in touch with the cyberpunk themes. Flying cars, supercomputers, urban environments, and really tall buildings with lots of neon. Just like Blade Runner. But with superheroes. Or at least one. And this is also a mystery thriller much like Mask of the Phantasm. What happened to the Joker? And why has he returned? What is his dark secret? Will Batman figure out the truth before it's too late? Just take the time to watch and I'm sure you'll be pleasantly surprised. It's actually pretty darn good.",
