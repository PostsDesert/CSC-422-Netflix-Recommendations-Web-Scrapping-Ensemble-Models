John Frankenheimer directs a nighmarish film that should not be seen alone.\n\nI saw \"Prophecy\" on a double bill with the original \"Friday the 13th,\" another bloody romp in the forest. The Jason film was second on the bill, and would've been unimpressive on its own, but was rendered especially impotent to this viewer after having all the bejeezus scared out of me by \"Prophecy.\" \n\nHighly recommended!"
