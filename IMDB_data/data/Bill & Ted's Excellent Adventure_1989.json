        "reviewBody": "If you've never seen the first two Bill & Ted movies, I suggest you pass on \"Bill & Ted Face the Music\". While this third film isn't bad, it certainly isn't as fun and original as the previous two...and it might also prove to be very confusing. But, if you are a fan already of the series, you'll enjoy this film provided you don't expect the impossible...for the film to recapture 100% of the charm and humor of the originals. Adjust your expectations and you will surely like the film.\n\nAs far as the plot goes, it's pretty confusing. Suffice to say that after the second film, when it appeared that the whole world was saved by Bill & Ted, over time you come to see that it was a fluke and Bill & Ted of 2020 are losers. How do they over come this and why do they need to? See the film.\n\nTo me, this film clearly was best released to video...which is what happened due to COVID. I would not have recommended you go to the theater to see it...but as a direct to DVD or film on a pay channel, it's well worth your time.",
