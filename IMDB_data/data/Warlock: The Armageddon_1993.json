        "reviewBody": "Handsome, charismatic Julian Sands reprises his role as the title character in this sequel that's pretty much just adequate all the way down the line. It has very little to do with the first movie, but has a basically similar plot, as The Warlock is reborn, and sets about uniting five precious gems in order to help his father Satan regain access to the world above. He is opposed by an order of druids; one of them is Will Travis (Steve Kahan), whose son Kenny (Chris Young) is destined to be one of two druid warriors that must battle the evildoer.\n\n\"Warlock: The Armageddon\" has enough entertaining moments to make it passable, whether they're a great visual gag or otherwise amusing bit of business. We get an elevator FULL of blood, a human turned into a twisted Picasso-like statue, and the requisite rebirth of our antagonist. There is some juicy gore, but a lot of the visual effects only succeed in being ropey enough to induce laughter. There's nothing to make the movie particularly memorable, as the music, production design, cinematography, and the like are all competent without possessing any real pizzazz.\n\nYoung (\"The Great Outdoors\") and the lovely Paula Marshall (\"Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth\") are a likeable hero and heroine, if not all that interesting. Certainly the interest lies with other cast members: Sands (\"Arachnophobia\") is a standout as the sardonic Warlock, and Kahan (Captain Murphy in the \"Lethal Weapon\" feature films), Charles Hallahan (John Carpenters' \"The Thing\"), R.G. Armstrong (\"Children of the Corn\" '84), Bruce Glover (\"Diamonds Are Forever\"), and Ferdy Mayne (\"The Horror Star\") comprise an excellent bunch of character actors. Gorgeous Joanna Pacula (\"Gorky Park\") is rather wasted as a fashion designer in possession of one of the stones. George \"Buck\" Flower (\"They Live\") is seen fleetingly in a crowd. And Zach Galligan, who'd worked with director Anthony Hickox on his earlier film \"Waxwork\", has a funny cameo.\n\nThis shows the viewer a decent time, but is a little over extended at just over 98 minutes.\n\nSix out of 10.",
