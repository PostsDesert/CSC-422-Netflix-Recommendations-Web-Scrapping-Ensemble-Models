        "reviewBody": "I simply had to see this made for TV vampire flick because Forever Knight is still one of my favorite shows. Nick Knight was the inspiration for the cult series that many of us know and love. If you ever dug Forever Knight, I would recommend checking this out. But I also warn you, if you've seen the pilot episode of Forever Knight, you've basically seen this movie. But for completists, it's neat to see someone else in the shoes of our vampire cop, Nick Knight. Rick Springfield (that's right, \"Jessie's Girl\") was the first to don the fangs, but I can't agree that he's the best. Rick Springfield and Michael Nader aren't nearly as cool as their Canadian counterparts. Geraint Wyn Davies and Nigel Bennett just have a completely different look to them and I think they fit the parts perfectly. It's also cool to see John Kapelos playing a louder, yet skinnier Detective Donald Schanke. He would be the only cast member to reprise his role for the duration of the series (I can't see anyone else in this role anyway). And, interestingly enough, the role of Natalie was played by...Robert Harper. That's right, Nick's doctor and confidant was a man originally. The show would have played out much differently if this concept hadn't changed. Much differently indeed. Anchor Bay released Nick Knight on DVD, so if you liked Forever Knight, pick it up."
