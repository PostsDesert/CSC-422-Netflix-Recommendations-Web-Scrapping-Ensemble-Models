The beginning is a little slow but it soon picks up speed quickly and then you are on the edge of your seat.\n\nSome people said 'GuiltyConscience' was predictable, but I severely disagree. Not only did Ihave no idea was was going to happen, but I gasped out loud at several points. The plot was simple but complicated. Hopkins was fantastic as the scheming husband and cross examiner. The rest of the cast was excellent as well. Thoroughly entertaining.\n\nCheck this film out if you are looking for interesting mystery-drama; you won't regret it.",
