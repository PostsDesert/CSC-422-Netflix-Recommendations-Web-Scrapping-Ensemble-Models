        "reviewBody": "This was the first Russian movie I was able to view and, I have to admit, I was impressed. It was one of the best movies I have ever seen.\n\nMikhail Filipchuk as 6-year-old \"Sanya\" gave a heart warming performance as a boy who lost his father to a war when his mother was only three months pregnant with him. Getting to know his new step-father and gaining his acceptance wasn't an easy task for him. Especially after his step-father is given 7 years in prison for his thievery.\n\nIn the end, 12-year-old \"Sanya\", played by Dmitri Chigaryov, is in an orphanage after his mother's death. The movie takes a strange twist...and...in the end....\"Sanya\" gets his justice.\n\nVery enjoyable, indeed."
