The result is a dish with no taste but an ugly appearance.\n\nNot to be confused with Serrador's brilliant WHO COULD KILL A CHILD? (sometimes called ISLAND OF DEATH), Mastorakis's effort is set on a Greek island which is a stage for various forms of slaughter, a little bestiality and some wholesale perversion.\n\nEverything moves at a snailish pace and the violent set pieces are poorly directed.\n\nTouted as \"The movie that the censors didn't want you to see\", I'd hazard a guess that the censors never saw it, they simply read the presskit until their knees jerked upwards.",
