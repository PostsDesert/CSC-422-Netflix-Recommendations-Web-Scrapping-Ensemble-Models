There are so many quotable lines in this movie that even if you haven't seen it, you've probably heard many of the jokes already. It's a great balance between situational comedy and absolute absurdity. Plus, there's even some actual story mixed in with the humor. This is one Will Ferrell movie that I think hits the comedy nail right on the head.",
