Nevertheless, the film was average grosser at the box office doing better in smaller centres.\n\nDharam and Mithun da shared heroine Anita Raaj in a love triangle while Kimi Katkar played Shotgun Sinha's love interest. A typical thakur vs gaonwalon ka revenge drama; the film had a Reecha like character who pops out of nowhere to attack the skimpy clad Kimi Katkar in one scene. Sadly, we aren't told anything about the origin of this monster at all. Not even his name!! Now, that would've been more interesting than the rest of the movie!!!\n\nRegards, Sumeet Nadkarni.",
