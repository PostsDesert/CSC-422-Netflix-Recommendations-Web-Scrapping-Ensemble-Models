        "reviewBody": "You can't be a horror fan and not be familiar with Clive Barker's \"Hellraiser\" movies. And as a horror fan chances are that you will enjoy them - the first few movies at the very least.\n\nThe core of the story of the \"Hellraiser\" franchise revolves around a mysterious artifact - an intricate puzzle box - which is said to be able to grant people what they desire the most. But it comes with a price, a terrible, terrible price. And it is guarded by the vile Cenobites.\n\nThe warped mind of Clive Barker really came up with something wonderfully morbid and disturbing when \"Hellraiser\" was first unleashed upon the world. Especially the Cenobites, they are grotesque but interesting at the same time.\n\nIn the first movie Larry and his wife Julia moves into Larry's old family house. The very same house where his brother Frank tried to unlock the puzzle box and was sent to Hell. An accident causes Larry's blood to be spilled on the floor, bringing back Frank from the dead. But in his flayed and fleshless state of being, Frank needs the blood and flesh of the living in order to regenerate his own body. But no one escapes Hell that easily.\n\nFor a 1987 movie, I will say that the effects still hold their own today, having withstood the test of time. Especially the rebirth of Frank and his transformation back to fully human. And the Cenobites, lets not forget the Cenobites; they were just amazing.\n\nWith this now classic horror movie the World saw the likes of Doug Bradley like never before and he instantly became a horror legend, just as Pinhead became a horror icon.\n\nI grew up with these horror movies along with other horror franchises, and I love them even today and make frequent visits back to them. If you are not familiar with \"Hellraiser\", shame on you. Then I would strongly recommend that you sit down and watch it, perhaps even do a movie marathon of the series.",
