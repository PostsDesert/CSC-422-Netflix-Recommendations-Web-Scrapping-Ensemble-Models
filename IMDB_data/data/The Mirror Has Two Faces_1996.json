For me now it's an 8, while my previous rating was 7. I think for a movie which had released for almost 30 years ago, it's still so good.\n\nI was curious and checked when I watch this before, because I have no idea during watching. Thankfully IMDB has history record! I found out watched it on February 2009, it's about 12 years ago and the rating getting higher 1 star ðŸ˜†",
