All the characters, even the most minor are well cast and played magnificently by all. I particularly enjoyed the Machiavellian scheming of \"Richard Cross\", played by Stanley Tucci, the smart comments of judge Beth Bornstein(I forget her real name) and Miriam Grasso played by Barbara Bosson (with such aplomb!).\n\nThey don't make them like this any more, 24 does not cut it in comparison.\n\nSarah"
