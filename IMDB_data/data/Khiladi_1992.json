Akshay kumar has given us a great performance here. Deepak Tijori, Shakti Kapoor, Ayesha Jhukla and Sabeeha give us decent performances. The action is superb; you can't fault it. It is so Akshay Kumar (high kicks, fast punches etc.). This film is an all-round entertainer with action, comedy and a lot of suspense.\n\nVerdict: If you haven't seen it yet, see it and look at what you've missed out on. Thumbs up - 9/10.",
