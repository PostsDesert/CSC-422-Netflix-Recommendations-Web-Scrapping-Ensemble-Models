        "reviewBody": "first things first, this ain't a dil to pagal hai/ kuch kuch hota hai.. But it still is watchable thanks to its cutesy take on love. i mean the theme of ' there is someone made for you & you will definitely meet him \" , this all has been explored time & again in our movies. But getting to know about each other through anonymous letters & then actually meeting in person is indeed quite cool, though may be old as a concept but still is lovely.. i am all praise for the leads , especially hrithik who sleepwalks through the role & especially is adorable while vocalizing serious lines..God only knows what the audience wished of him to have lambasted his serious effort when the flick released.. Not to forget esha( her debut??) ,hers is the quite researched role of that of a young , a bit childish but mature in thinking types . She looks good in some moments & though her acting may not be class apart but she does justice to her role..Director does have potential of telling a good story,in fact i specially liked the serious scenes & romantic web he created.. Not at all a bad offering.. Ya, music is a big let down & to add to that the female playback singing is pathetic.. A romantic flick has to have a good hummable music which indeed was simply absent here...",
