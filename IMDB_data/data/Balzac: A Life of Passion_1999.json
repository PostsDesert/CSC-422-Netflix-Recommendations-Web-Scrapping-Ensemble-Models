        "reviewBody": "it is an useful introduction to Balzac universe. it is a splendid meeting with great actors in brilliant roles. it is occasion to remind a history who seduces generation by generation. in same measure, it is one of Depardieu movies and this fact is important to discover the metamorphose of a literary legend in a character who preserves the force and the charm, the vulnerability and the sins of original. Balzac by Depardieu is passionate , strange and idealistic. it is a character so it can be different, original, unrealistic. important is just the manner to explore his life. to remind his extraordinary work. to seem identify pieces of reality. that is all. and the presence of Jeanne Moreau, the special manner to create a beautiful sketch for madame Hanska by Fanny Ardant are the real virtues of this film about a hero of universal culture."
