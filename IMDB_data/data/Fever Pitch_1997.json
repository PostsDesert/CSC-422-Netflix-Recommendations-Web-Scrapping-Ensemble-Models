This is an autobiographical book by Nick Hornby, a long-time Arsenal fan, who also did the screenplay. Incidently, the book is considered one of the best soccer books ever written. For those who liked High Fidelity, a book also written by Nick Hornby, and reset in Chicago, they will enjoy the romance of Fever Pitch, the movie. Colin Firth from Shakespeare in Love is excellent.",
