Maybe it was because I was just in the mood for something stupid, or maybe it was because of Majandra Delfino's long legs, but it was worth a smile or two. This movie might not win any awards, but if you want to see something kinda light, go for it. If you're looking for something that's going to be interesting, deep or meaningful, rent something else."
