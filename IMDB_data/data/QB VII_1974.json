        "reviewBody": "QB VII is well worth watching, it is equally good as mini-series entertainment and as a tale of human struggle. It has an epic sweep, great acting, great location shots, and a core story that is extremely compelling. To my taste it was bit too long and drawn-out, but others found the pace to be just right for savoring the deeply humane behaviors on display. Despite winning an Emmy Award (one of six wins and 13 nominations) for sound editing, I found the sound quality to be inconsistent and often flawed, needing playbacks to hear clearly. Overall, that was a small price to pay for this small gem of a production.",
