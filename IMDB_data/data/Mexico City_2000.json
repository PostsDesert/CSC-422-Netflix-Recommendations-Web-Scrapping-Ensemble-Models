There is an easy to follow storyline and the film is acted out almost believably. I cannot add more to the technicality of the film but what I can say about this movie is that I love the musical score, the scenes, the way it draws me into the film here and there.\n\nIt's a movie I would recommend if you are open-minded and are in need of a relaxing time. For what it's worth, it's a movie that will be average but if you are like me it's a film that will forever stick with you.",
