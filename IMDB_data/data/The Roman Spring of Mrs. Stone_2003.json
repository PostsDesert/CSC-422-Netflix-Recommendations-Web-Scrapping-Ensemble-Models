        "reviewBody": "Since the other users have provided details, ad nauseam, I will only say that Mirren seems to be channeling Vivien Leigh at times, especially in the last half. Many mannerisms are nearly identical to Leigh's actions in the 1961 studio version.\n\nAlso, strangely enough, I prefer the sound stage artifice of the 1960s. This cable movie was actually filmed on location, but in muted, boring colors. The 1961 feature has the wonderful Technicolor hues.\n\nI found the actor portraying The Young Man/stalker to be far more sexy than Martinez's Paolo, even though he eats food off the ground, urinates in public, hacks up phlegm and never speaks.\n\nBancroft is fine, although I would have loved to have seen Sophia Loren take a stab at it.\n\nAnd will you cable movie directors STOP overusing the \"atmospheric\" smoke machines?!! It looks like your entire film crew was smoking cigarettes during the interior scenes."
