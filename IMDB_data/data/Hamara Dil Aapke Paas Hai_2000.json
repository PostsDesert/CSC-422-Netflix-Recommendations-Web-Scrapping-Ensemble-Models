On the next scene, we saw that Preeti was hated by her own father. As the curiosity of the audience started to increase, the story unfolds itself when the film showed flashback for the audience to know the real story of Preeti and Avinash. Both have a dark secret that they tried to hide.\n\nThe story coped about the stigma in India on rape victims. It was clearly illustrated in the film that a rape victim will be shunned by her own family and society. She would be doomed to be unmarried for life since her father would be ashamed to consider her as 'perished goods'. An astounding performance by the lead especially Aishwarya Rai as Preeti, the rape victim. I would suggest this story to anyone who wanted to see the taboo breaking on rape victim in India.",

Bhavani is arrested and held for trial. This angers the Choudhry family. The victim is threatened with dire consequences, and he withdraws the complaint, and as a result Bhavani is released and all charges are dropped. Preeti is then raped by one of the Choudhry men, and subsequently her very own family disowns her. She finds shelter with another do-gooder, Avinash, who even takes her to his apartment. But the story does not end here, for the neighborhood is soon in an uproar over her, and want her to leave. The only solution is that Preeti marry Avinash, she agrees to do so, and then finds out that there is two children who called Avinash \"daddy\", and she does not know if there is another woman or even a wife involved. And then the police arrest Preeti under the charge of prostitution, on a complaint filed by none other than Avinash's dad.",
