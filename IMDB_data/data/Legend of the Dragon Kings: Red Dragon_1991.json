        "reviewBody": "Legend of the Dragon is one of my favourite Stephen Chow films, probably because it is so quintessentially Chinese. It's old vs new, rich vs poor, corrupt vs virtuous, etc, etc. In portraying all these aspects, you get a vivid impression of Hong Kong at its earthy best.\n\nDo I need to go into the plot? I guess so. Young naive and backward Stephen lives on a somewhat backward HK island that developers want to use to make an Airport. Chow's cousin is used to fool his father out of the land, and Chow must use his kung fu snooker skills to save the day.\n\nThe film lacks the genuinely hyper-absurd moments of God of Cookery or 60 million dollar man, but isn't as oddly deflating as My Hero, or over-slick like From Beijing with Love.\n\nIt's good.",
