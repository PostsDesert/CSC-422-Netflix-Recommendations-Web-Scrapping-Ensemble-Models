In fact, I found them to be quite a striking experiment for Clive Barker to decide to start his early days in the cinema and they are no different from other very peculiar short films made by great directors in their early days. Both shorts are silent and filmed in black and white, but the peculiarity of these is the editing, since the story of both is narrated through images, but in such a way that it makes them look like music videos. It is because of the editing and the mixed images that these tapes can be somewhat difficult to understand, but the concept explains everything and more than movies themselves, rather they are a visual experience. It is also worth mentioning that due to this, these films have a rather nightmarish vision and feel surreal, especially The Forbidden, since it has a mixture of negative tape with black and white, which makes it look very strange and sometimes I finish it. Compared to the short Un Chien Andalou by Luis Buñuel.",
