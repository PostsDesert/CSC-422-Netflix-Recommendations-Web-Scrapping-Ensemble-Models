        "reviewBody": "I was invited to a viewing of this film at a neighbor's house up the street. I thought it was a neighborhood get together, but it turned out to be a simultaneous nationwide viewing sponsored by moveon.org. So my guard was up as I was surrounded by a lot of Bush hating liberals, but the movie had just started as I arrived and I was quickly seated in the back. So I decided to stick it out and watch. I'm glad I did.\n\nAll along, I felt that the story we've been told about why we are in Iraq has changed over time. I remember that we were sure that there were weapons ready to be unleashed on us or given to Al-Queda terrorists who would smuggle them in to our country and cause more damage than the World Trade Center attack. Then it was not so much the weapons as the weapons programs. And there were those \"mobile weapons labs\". And then it was simply to liberate the Iraqi people. It's all jumbled in my mind and I can't remember exactly when and how the official reason change, I just know that it did somehow.\n\nThe best thing about this film is that it documents the subtle changes over time by showing our leaders speaking at various times before and after our invasion of Iraq. There is no \"liberal bias\" like you get from the news sometimes, it was simply factual presentation of what our leaders told us and when.\n\nIt also presents documentary evidence of things we were mislead about. The \"yellow cake\" in Niger, the \"uranium enrichment tubes\" that were actually not suitable for that purpose, the \"mobile weapons labs\", the satellite evidence and so on.\n\nAfter seeing this movie, I am left with two possibilities. We were either lied to deliberately or our leaders were grossly negligent and incompetent. Whatever your political views, this movie should make you angry about how we have been mislead. It pulls together a lot of information that is jumbled in the public mind and makes it clear.\n\nIf you can stand hearing the views of the people that gravitate to this sort of thing, I encourage you to watch it at a local group presentation. Or buy a copy from the website and watch it with friends. It brings up a lot for discussion and thought.",
