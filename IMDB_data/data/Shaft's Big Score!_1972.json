He even gets worked over good by the baddies.\n\nMoses Gunn is back as Bumpy, a Blofeld character, and antagonist extraordinaire. And, of course, it's the old song about the Mafia horning in on Black turf that makes Shaft interesting - playing against both sides; black and white.\n\nRosalind Miles is here to keep Shaft interested at home, but you know he will stray, so there is Kathy Imrie to bump into and bed.\n\nThe ending with it's car chase and helicopter and machine guns is pure Bond, and Shaft outdoes Bond with a satchel full of loot to take home.\n\nPure fun!",
