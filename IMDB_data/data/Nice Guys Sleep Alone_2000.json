OH MY SWEET CHRIST!!! This is probably one of the most ridiculously, embarassingly horrible movies ever committed to celluloid! I watched it in the privacy of my own home and was still cringing and looking around to see if anybody was watching me watch this movie. I don't think we could fit any more tired, ineffective cliches and dialogue into a film if we tried. Don't get me wrong...I love when people make the effort to make films but JESUS...PLEASE!!!!!"
