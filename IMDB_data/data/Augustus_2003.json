        "reviewBody": "I love horror films and cult horror, and I spend a great amount of time watching these types of movies. I was skeptical to watch this due to the high number of bad reviews it received here. Curiosity killed the cat. I started watching the movie with an open-mind. I don't have a problem with camera shake, I'm not squeamish about gore and rape. Of course I must agree this movie is sick on pretty much every level. But all together content, quality, directing... none of that bothered me.\n\nWhat I disliked about this film is that the plot is so weak. In fact there is barely a plot at all and thus as disturbing as it is, it's boring. Believe it or not. I understand the basic idea of the film, sick and twisted people on a killing spree, but a lot of the scenes seemed thrown together in no particular order. In a way it was confusing, but not in a strange artistic David Lynch type of confusing way. The composition of the film, just simply fails to be compelling in any way. \n\nIf you are simply looking to be disgusted or disturbed then I can recommend this film. However if you are looking for at least something of a functional film, don't waste your time on this one.",
