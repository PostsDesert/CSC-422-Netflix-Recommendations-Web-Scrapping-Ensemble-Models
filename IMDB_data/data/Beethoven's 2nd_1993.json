This second generation of St Bernard pups renews my faith that animals can be treated very well in the movies. The dogs are the most fun part of this movie. Missy and Beethoven getting into some trouble and having their pups while Missy's surrogate owner is completely unaware. It's a really fun movie for adults and children that are over 8 years of age. There's quite a bit of inappropriate content in this movie such as Chris Penn's character dangling one of Missy's puppies over the cliff. Other than that it was a fun movie."
