        "reviewBody": "No Mercy looked like a disaster on paper, but it wasn't really that bad. The guys and gals worked hard. Results from the show: \n\n\n* Eddie Guerrero defeated Luther Reigns in a good match.\n\n\n\n* Spike Dudley pinned Nunzio in a crap match.\n\n\n\n* Rene Dupree and Kenzo Suzuki pinned RVD and Rey Mysterio in a good match, but this was due to all the participants making it good with the exception of Kenzo Suzuki who is a terrible wrestler.\n\n\n\n* John Cena defeated Booker T to win the US title. The action was fair at least by Cena's standards.\n\n\n\n* Billy Kidman pinned Paul London in the match of the night.\n\n\n\n* Miss Jackie, Charlie Haas and Rico pinned The Dudley Boyz and Dawn Marie in a funny comedy match. Look out for Rico doing his comedy in this match, he'll have you in tears of laughter.\n\n\n\n* JBL defeated The Undertaker in a last ride match. It was OK, but after the beat down of JBL, Heidenreich jumped out of the hearst and put Taker inside it. He then smashed a vehicle he was driving into the hearst. WWE thought that they deserved an 'A' for excellent for this stunt, but fans begged to differ. They booed loudly giving this more like an 'F' for fail.\n\n\nThis is my first WWE post since Eddie Guerrero passed Away on 13th November 2005. RIP uncle Eddie. Heaven has now got some Latino Heat.\n\nOverall Grade - B",
