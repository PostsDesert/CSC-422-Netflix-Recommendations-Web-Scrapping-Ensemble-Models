        "reviewBody": "Life According to Muriel gives us a fascinating glimpse of Patagonia, a place we see all too seldom (in movies or elsewhere).\n\nBut there are more reasons than that. The story, told from a little girl's perspective (Muriel), concerns an eccentric single mother who leaves Buenos Aires to go and live in the mountains. She stashes all her belongings (and her kid) in the car, and heads for the hills, destination uncertain. After the car (containing money and possessions) is destroyed, the two (now destitute)go to seek shelter at a run-down hotel occupied by another single mother.\n\nAfter initially being shooed away, Muriel and her mother are grudgingly given a night's sanctuary. Although the two women distrust each other (the airhead city girl versus the practical country matron), they determine to get along because both have basically been left in the lurch.\n\nMuriel's father later puts in an appearance, but this leads nowhere and he drops out of the picture again; meanwhile the hotel-owner has a contretemps with the errand-boy, who has designs on her - and this has unfortunate results.\n\nThe story doesn't really have an ending, it is one of those continuum-of-life things. The two families go their separate ways, but in the last shot it is suggested that they are re-uniting.\n\n The film doesn't sound very exciting, but it works its charm on you for no definable reason. And how many Argentine films do you get to see anyway?",
