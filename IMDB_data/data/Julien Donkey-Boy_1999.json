I felt \"gummo\" was a great film, and didn't see exactly how this was going to compare. \"Julien\" actually seemed to surpass in reality. It was in no way a mainstream film, but on the other hand, it was not too \"artsy\" to be understandable. It kept my attention the entire time. I was intrigued not only by the film techniques but by the story it told. The characters were outstanding considering nothing was scripted. I thought the end of the film was very offensive when watching it, but thinking back on it now, it was handled very well and the movie was telling a story. All actors were very believable, and Svengy did a magnificent job. I think my favorite part in the film was the scene in the thrift store. I was also very happy to notice Will Oldham in the party scene and then see a thank you to him in the credits. If \"gummo\" intrigued you, this film will also.",

Julien lives at home with his pregnant sister Pearl (Chloë Sevigny), his brother Chris, who wrestles in his spare time; and their violent father, who slaps his children around, hoses them down with water, and offers to pay Chris ten dollars to dress up in his late mother's clothes and dance. Eventually Julien escapes from his home and interacts with people on the street.",
