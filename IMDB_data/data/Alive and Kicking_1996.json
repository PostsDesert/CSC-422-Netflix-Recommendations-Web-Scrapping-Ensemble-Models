Second, the struggle of just dancing everyday to be perfect. Third, the need for everyone to love me and of course my dancing. The final scene will tug at your heart. I've seen this disease up close and it can really do this to a person, but this guy's guts and determination to not give up just gave me goose bumps during the final dance. You can just see the passion, love, strength, energy, commitment, determination, and guts that this guy had up until the end. It will truly amaze you. Also I loved the whole idea of this beautiful sexy blond dancer falling in love with the not so beautiful therapist (fat, balding and not a blonde). See it."
