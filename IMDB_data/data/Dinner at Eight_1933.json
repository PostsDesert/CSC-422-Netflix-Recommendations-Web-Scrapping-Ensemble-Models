She radiates an overt yet somehow innocent sexuality that shows why she became a major star so quickly.\n\nMarie Dressler proves why she was so heralded. Her acting cannot be called subtle -- but it is always effective.\n\nAfter watching this film you will wonder if people ever really did live this way. Strangely enough, I believe they probably did.",
