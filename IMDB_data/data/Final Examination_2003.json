        "reviewBody": "A hard-nosed cop gets punished by being sent to a Hawaii police department. While there, a group of sorority sisters start being killed one by one, with the killer leaving what looks to be a term paper marked \"Failed Examination\" with the victim's name on it near the body. This seemed like a cool concept at first, until they dropped it after the second death. In a way, it reminded me of Identity where they were all being left the room keys in order of their death, which made it unique, but I guess the writers on this one couldn't find an interesting way to go with this, which is a shame.\n\nOverall, not too bad a movie. Seemed like it borrowed from Scream a little bit. The T & A was nice, mostly quality, which many people look for in a film of this caliber. Amy Lindsay and Debbie Rochon were my favorite actresses in this movie. I give it a 6 of 10."
