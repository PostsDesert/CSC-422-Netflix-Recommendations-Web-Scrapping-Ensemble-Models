It's a good time, utterly bazaar and twisted, but fun.\n\nIf you liked Dead Alive (BrainDead), anything from Troma Films or Early Sam Raimi flicks you will understand the message this movie is trying to deliver. All the people with negative criticism about the movie, lighten up would ya, no one forced you to watch it."
