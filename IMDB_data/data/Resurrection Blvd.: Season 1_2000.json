Especially seeing people from a different culture experience the same tragedies and family traditions that us Americans have. Like infidelity in the family,trust,and losing a loved one. This shows a great significance of family values and support,that everyone can relate to. There's some stubbornness among the siblings but overall in the end,the family (Santiagos) will always stick together. Just alone the show has a type of reality check of how important a family can be. Excellent show!!"
