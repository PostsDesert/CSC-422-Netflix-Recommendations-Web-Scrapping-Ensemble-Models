        "reviewBody": "Yes, it's inept directing, bad acting, illogical continuity etc. etc.\n\nBut it's fascinating! Everybody can do a cheap shot at Wood and repeat the degrading clichés but it is my impression that most people don't judge for themselves or play along for the ride. It's worth it. It is a fact that hallmarks of a \"good movie\" are: 1) it entertained you, 2) you remember it with enthusiasm. And it did both for me.\n\nThe music was so bold and different and had everything to do with creating the atmosphere in the film. I really liked it because I felt it worked for it's purpose. It gave the film it's very own identity.\n\nI would anytime rather see an Ed Wood film than most of the Hollywood clichés poured out these days. I prefer Ed Wood for Steven Spielberg any day because you feel Wood does it for his own sake, not just to please the lowest denominator."
