This is one of those 'best of!' tv shows that ends up skipping over a LOT of great films, and interviewing people- David Copperfield!?- who really aren't even in the film business. But, it does offer glimpses of Woody Allen and Clint Eastwood and some of those greats, so I guess it's got some credibility. I just got a little bored by it after a while."
