        "reviewBody": "This was an outstanding film dealing with two young people who had mental problems that were deep seeded into their minds and how they both struggled; to help each other find the light at the end of the tunnel. Keir Dullea,(David Clemens) \"De Sade\",'69, played the role of a\n\nyoung man coming from a rich family, who had a big hang up about anyone touching him in any way, even with a pinkie finger. If you did touch him, he went crazy and carried on like a brat of a child. Janet Margolin,(Lisa Brandt),\"Annie Hall\",'77, was another mentally disturbed young girl, pretty and seemed to glow when she looked at David. Howard Da Silva,(Dr. Swinford),\"The Great Gatsby\",'74 was the shrink in charge of the mental facility and had a full time job just trying to get David & Lisa to open up their twisted and disturbed minds. Great acting and a very enjoyable film, which at times is depressing and very down to earth.",
