The picture looks great & Rhino Home Video also added a 5.1 track as well. Pat was 30 when this was shot & she looks great. She was the female queen of the 80's what \"Shania Twain\" is to the 90's. Her music brings back alot of teenage memories for myself. She is a rock legend & her music will always stand the test of time..All the best Pat & Neil...",
