        "reviewBody": "This film was a major hit upon release in the summer of '79. With a budget seven-million-dollars, the film took in over $40 million at the domestic box office and became one of the top-ten grossers of the year. Unfortunately, it has since been written off by many fans and critics alike as one of Streisand's weakest film efforts. As for myself, I believe THE MAIN EVENT manages to be likable, funny, and entertaining. Even though we've seen the same story a thousand times before, THE MAIN EVENT is very enjoyable while it's playing.\n\nThe scenes are all set up very well, the one-liners are funny (\"I said celebrate, not fornicate \"), and Streisand and O'Neal give off a strong sexual charge between them on screen. The film also features a very strong supporting cast, with Paul Sand, Whitman Mayo, and Patti D'Arbanville turning in terrific performances. Unfairly mangled by most critics and many viewers (many of whom need to learn how to loosen up), the film is complete fun from start to finish. Ignore all of the naysayers, THE MAIN EVENT stands one of my favorite romantic comedies.",
