        "reviewBody": "Wesley Snipes has always been trusty in the action genre. He has great charisma and looks totally cool when kicking the crap out of the bad guys. Ever since his breakthrough role in \"Passenger 57.\" There are many great moments of action in \"The Art of War.\" Sure, the plot is far from compelling, but the energy and fast pace keeps it fueled.\n\n \"The Art of War\" is not a work of art, but it's a great popcorn flick and one that won't put you to sleep! I just wish they could've done something about the cliches. I'm not going to give anything away, so I'll just say, \"Why is it in these movies the characters never seem to know who their limo driver is?\" It's an overused cliche and a cheap surprise.\n\n My score: 7 (out of 10)",
