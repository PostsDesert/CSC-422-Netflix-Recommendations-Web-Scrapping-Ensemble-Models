        "reviewBody": "Every once in a while a film comes along that makes you believe in dreams all over again. As Paulo Coelho rightly says, somewhere along the line, most of us decide that dreams are not meant to be true. Well, this movie proves otherwise... and how! It is a movie for those young at heart - and my mother has seen it thrice!! Simply put, it is one long joy-ride, with wonderful music, exotic and virgin locales and just the right amount of characters. The best thing about the film is the willing suspension of disbelief that is required of any film-goer these days by the film-maker. Ram Gopal Varma takes care of our disbelief, and in his hands, it starts turning into that elusive 'belief'. That is why the film probably has an appeal only for those who are willing to give life a chance. If you believe life is just what happens to you while you are making other plans, I would recommend a dosage of MAST thrice a day! It will change the way you look at things; if you give it a fair chance. That is what a film should be - almost too good to be true, yet with that sweetly scented whiff of belief that stays with you long after you leave the movie-hall. A simple story about the things we consider the most complicated, brilliantly and sensitively handled and told. A modern fairy tale. A small 'big-movie'!!! Totally 'mast' baba!!! Sorry, but can't write anymore; have to catch the night show of the movie. Joining me, anyone???",
