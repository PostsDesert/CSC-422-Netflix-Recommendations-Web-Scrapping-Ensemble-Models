Kader Khan, I thought, was the funniest part of them all. I thought the humor attempted by Akshay Kumar on Salman Khan seemed a bit harsh and not all that funny. The trio of Salman, Priyanka, and Akshay gave a good performance. \"Jeene Ke Hai 4 Din\" and \"Lal Dupatta\" were good songs. The others were average. The climax was nice and improved the movie quite a bit as it was going quite downhill towards the end. Akshay Kumar's star power seems to be gradually increasing day-by-day as his movies seem to be doing quite well. This movie is not bad; it's a good timepass.",
