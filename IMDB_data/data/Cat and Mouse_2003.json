It was entertaining and pleasant enough, but not as good as I had hoped. I wanted more action, more kung fu, and more story. It was a comedy, and while Hong Kong comedies are traditionally light on story, this one was definitely not as bad as many others. Except for a few rather silly jokes, there was nothing offensive or disgusting in this movie; it was mainly a mainstream showcase for two of Hong Kong's most attractive stars.\n\nFor a Cecilia Cheung fan, it is a very worthwhile movie. Not only does it feature plentiful close-up shots of her delectable face, it also gives her a good character and some good (though perhaps a bit too romantic) scenes to work with. Despite the light-hearted material, she does manage to demonstrate some considerable acting skill, which is the thing that best serves to recommend the movie.\n\n6 out of 10.",
