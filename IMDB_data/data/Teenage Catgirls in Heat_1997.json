        "reviewBody": "The first half of this movie is dull and plodding, with too little footage of the title creatures and too much footage of an annoying, overacting, unfunny, boozing \"cat hunter\" who becomes the hero's sidekick. The second half is a bit better, thanks mostly to the beautiful Carrie Vanston, who gives a wonderfully earnest and unembarrassed performance doing things that many other actresses would consider embarrassing (licking, hissing, scratching, rubbing herself against humans, drinking liquids, etc. like a cat). The other \"catgirls\" do a pretty good job too, and the occasional nudity helps, but overall this is yet another case of the Title Being Better Than The Movie - don't you just hate it when that happens? And I know it's not supposed to be taken seriously, but they still should have come up with a better excuse for the catgirls going so quickly from simply repeating sentences they heard on TV and a tape recorder to speaking perfect English.
