        "reviewBody": "I enjoy your show but was disturb by what I saw. Why would a seasoned officer handle evidence in a case with bare hands (no gloves), the mace container. Why would an officer handle evidence without gloves. Not only was evidence contaminated but now the officer prints are on the container. The show I saw was aired on December 28, 2005 at 11:30 pm on SUN TV in Hamilton. It makes me concerned that this may be an avenue for the defense that the evidence was contaminated. Or are we dealing with a COST issued like rape cases ( unless you can identify our rapist the DNA is not tested) so a serial rapist can go undetected. The only way to identify a criminal is by EYE WITNESS identification which we know is unreliable.",
