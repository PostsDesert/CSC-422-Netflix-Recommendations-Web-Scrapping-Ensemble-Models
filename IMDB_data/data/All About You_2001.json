It is so good to see two young people sit and talk about up building things. The way they were able to feel for each other without words.This movie brought tears to my eyes, and I'm not a baby. It is hard to turn on your TV and fine a movie that can be recommended to your friends. I have been married for 35 years, this movie made me remember the way you would fall in love. How you would look forward to seeing that person. How your heart would pain until they came into sight.This is the way people would grow in love.I also appreciated the way they tried to understand each others background. The way they had something in common,they both lost their mothers. Speaking about the music, it added the right touch. My hat is off to the composer.",
