The acting is pathetic, the camera work amateurish, the plot dull and the dialogue stinks. Any good reviews of this movie can only have been submitted by the director or so called actors. I cannot see how anyone who enjoys a good horror movie could sit through this, and before you ask, no I didn't. About 20 minutes was all I could take. On the plus side, the cover art does look quite good. If you need to watch this type of movie then go for something like Wrong Turn or House of 1000 Corpses. Watching this trash is a complete waste of time and you should demand your money back from the rental store.",
