        "reviewBody": "Compelling drama about a man's efforts to keep his family safe and out of the Civil War. It's an anti-war story that was obviously meant to be about the then-current war, Vietnam, as much if not more than the one in the story. The film looks and feels like a western, although it's set in Virginia. Like most westerns from back then, it's a mix of serious drama with action scenes and even some moments of comedy. James Stewart plays the lead and gives an exceptional performance. Fine support from George Kennedy, Paul Fix, Patrick Wayne, Doug McClure, Katharine Ross (in her film debut), Glenn Corbett, and Rosemary Forsyth, who does a great job as Stewart's ballsy daughter. Some riveting emotional scenes and some nice action. Definitely worth a look for Stewart fans or anyone who enjoys films with subtext.",
