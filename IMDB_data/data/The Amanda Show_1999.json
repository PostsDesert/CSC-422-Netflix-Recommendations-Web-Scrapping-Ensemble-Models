        "reviewBody": "Amanda Bynes is so funny coming from \"All That\" and she is so charismatic and enjoyable to watch. This also spawned a spin-off sitcom called \"Drake & Josh\". So many good thins about this show.\n\nThe jokes are clean-humored yet hilarious. I remember seeing all the episodes and loving all the sketches. Spoofs on Blockbuster, Judge Judy, Survivor, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, and other pop culture references are one of the many reasons this show will always be funny. Even thought repetitive, those Hillbilly Moments are slapstick and always give me a good laugh.\n\nThis show is so nostalgic of my childhood. I also remember LFO performing, which was also something amazing. This TV show was one of the funniest kids show I have ever seen. Miss Bynes, we love you!",
