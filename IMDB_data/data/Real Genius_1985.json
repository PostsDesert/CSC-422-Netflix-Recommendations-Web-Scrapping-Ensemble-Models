        "reviewBody": "The imagination and quality of Hollywood movies in the early and mid 80's had regressed back to the pre \"Bonnie and Clyde\" days (the early and mid-60's being the worst ever period of American movie-making).\n\nFortunately there were a few gems like \"Real Genius\" to sustain audiences. Any film that features a memorable moment like Deborah Foreman's articulation of her standards for a male companion, a memorable character like Michelle Meyrink's hyper-kinetic Jordon, and the memorable sight of a house exploding from the force of a giant Jiffy Pop container can never be forgotten.\n\nAnd who doesn't feel good just watching the neighborhood kids play in a mountain of popcorn to the sound of Tears For Fears' \"Everybody Wants To Rule The World\".\n\nAlthough \"Real Genius\" has not totally escaped the ravages of the past 20 years, it has held up reasonably well. Now it can even be appreciated as a sort of time capsule, demonstrating rather strikingly the complete computerization of the applied sciences that has occurred during the relatively short time period since its 1985 release. Other than Kent's incidental use of an early computer in his dorm room and a mostly decorative monitor in the lab, these now essential machines are absent from this techno film. Amazing! \n\nThen again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",
