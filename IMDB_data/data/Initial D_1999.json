        "reviewBody": "Initial D is a Japanese Cartoon dealing with the Drift Racing scene which is now popular among the youth of Japan. The story revolves around Takumi Fujiwara, a drift racer of incredible skill, and his car, a Toyota AE86 (Hachiroku) Corolla. The art is a combination of traditional animation and CG, usually when dealing with the cars. What really makes the series, however, is the attention to detail. Keiichi Tsuchiya (Dorikin, The Drift King) is an advisor to the show, and it seems to have paid off. Not only is the driving technique realistic for the most part (drivers are shown heel-toe'ing, car detail is spot on), but the characters take the time to explain many of the driving techniques.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, this anime has acquired quite a following in the United States, among automotive enthusiasts. While distribution was largely limited to VHS copies subtitled by fans, in the past few months proper DVDs with English subtitles have shown up on ebay."
