        "reviewBody": "The pilot episode was decent. As for just staring the will Trent series in the books I find it hard with adaptations. Will Trent should be 6 3 and large strong physical presence. The lead is good pick as I find he is mimicking the character well so far. As for Amanda the choice was perfect. When pictured in the novels I always saw a strong black female presence it is probably one of the best adaptations I have seen done. Now with faith that one is hard to see and deal with. The character is to me not appealing. This one I'm hoping it will improve but time will tell. If you read the books at first there is some hesitation towards this tv adaptation. If your just learning of this show it is appealing and something we have seen before but I have hopes it will lead to more.\n\nKnowing Karin slaughter is the executive producer I'm sure she blessed all this current PC adaptations so I put my trust in her views as to where this will lead.\n\nCan't wait for the next episode!!!",
