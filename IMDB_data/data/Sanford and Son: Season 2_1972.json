        "reviewBody": "Sanford and Son (1972) was a classic American television sitcom that was based upon the B.B.C. tele-comedy show Steptoe and Son. Whilst Steptoe and Son dealt with the \"Rag and bone\" business, Sanford and Son dealt with the \"junk\" business. A perfect vehicle for stand up comic and performer Redd Foxx. Many people felt that he couldn't make the transition from party records and blue humor to the restrained format of television. He proved them wrong. During the first couple of seasons some of the episodes (including the pilot) were Americanized versions of Steptoe and Son.\n\nThe show became a huge hit for N.B.C. and the series lasted for six seasons.\n\nthe \"classic\" episodes of this show were written by Paul Mooney and Gary Shandling. The best seasons happen to be the second and fifth, many classic episodes debuted during that time. Aunt Esther was Fred's nemesis, Rollo was Lamont's best friend and another thorn in Fred's side. Fred also has his buddies Bubba and Grady. Fred was involved with Donna to whom he was engaged to throughout the series. Redd Foxx always had problems with the producers of the show and he used his leverage as the star to get his stand-up comic friends on T.V. Performers such as Pat Morita, \"Slappy\" White, Scatman Crothers and the comic team of Leroy and Skillet all received spots or recurring roles on the show.\n\nThanks to D.V.D. and syndication, Sanford and Son will live on forever and future generations will enjoy the humor of Redd Foxx and company. Sanford and Son spawned two spin-offs and a sequel series.\n\nA highly recommended show.",
