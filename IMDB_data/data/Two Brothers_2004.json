        "reviewBody": "Two tiger cubs are born deep in the jungles of French Indo-China. The tiger cubs are growing up among ancient temple ruins, which will bring the outside world to their home. One of the tiger cubs is gentle in nature and the other is brave. One of the tiger cubs is captured when a famous hunter (Guy Pearce) goes to the temple to loot its statues. A circus buys the tiger cub for its tiger act. The circus trainer uses force to make him jump through a hoop of fire and be a true tiger act. Later, the other cub is captured, and the regional administrator gives the tiger to his son. The tiger cub tears up the house and has a conflict with their dog, so the boy is forced to give the tiger away to the king's animal museum. A year later, the two brothers are matched against each other to fight in the king's arena. The storyline about tigers in the wild and what can happen to them is somewhat ok. It is not a totally cheerful movie, but I did enjoy the parts where the tiger cubs were being brothers, and the ending. (Universal Pictures, Run time 1:48, Rated PG) (5/10)"
