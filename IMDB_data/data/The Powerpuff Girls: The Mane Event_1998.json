        "reviewBody": "This show is one of the reason why I would usually choose Cartoon Network over Nickelodeon has a kid. Sure, Nickelodeon had Jimmy Neutron, Spongebob Squarepants, the Fairly OddParents, My Life as a Teenage Robot, Chalk Zone, Oh Yeah Cartoons, and Ren and Stempy; however, Cartoon Network had some of my favorite all time shows like Ed Edd 'n Eddy, The Powerpuff Girls, Johnny Bravo, Megas XLR, Teen Titans, Hanna Barbera classics like the Jetsons; the Flintstones; Wacky Races; Josie and the Pussycats; Scooby Doo; etc. , the Looney Tunes, and programming blocks like Toonami; Cartoon Cartoons; Carton Cartoons Fridays; etc. Speaking of those programming blocks, I also preferred the bumpers Cartoon Network would use with them; for example, Toonami had Tom (who was the successor to Moltar).\n\nBut, on to the point, the Powerpuff Girls was a big part of my childhood. I admit I was embarrassed to watch or speak of the show in public, but I grew past that. So yeah, if you haven't seen the original Powerpuff girls, you should check them out.\n\nP.S. Mojo Jojo is the best villain in the show. He's right next to Princess Morbucks, the Rowdyruff Boys, and that Powerpuff Girls collector (you know the one in that single episode).",
