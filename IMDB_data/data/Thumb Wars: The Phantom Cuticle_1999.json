It's a comical parody, for Pete's sake - not an Oscar entry! It's not supposed to WOW you over with million dollar special effects - it's supposed to poke fun at our modern film culture.\n\nThis film was not released in theaters but was made strictly for home entertainment uses. I purchased the DVD box set of all 6 Thumb films for my kids for Christmas and we have laughed ourselves silly at these clever and quite creative shorts. Such titles as, \"Thumbtanic\", \"The Blair Thumb\", \"Frankenthumb\", \"The Godthumb\" and \"Bat Thumb\" - each one a hilarious and extremely inventive jab at classic cinema. Who would have ever thought of making films with thumbs as the stars? Only Steve Oedekerk and Co., that's who!\n\nWho cares if Star Wars came out in 1977 and the jokes for this film are old and tired? This is good stuff, people! Sure, the characters in the film are all thumbs Â– that's why it's called \"Thumb Wars\"! Want a hearty, cheap laugh at a classic sci-fi film? Watch this and you won't be sorry!",
