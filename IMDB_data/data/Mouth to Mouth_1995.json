        "reviewBody": "It's not an American film, there is plenty of English in it, but if you don't understand Spanish you gotta turn on the subtitles; fast paced movie, never really loses you, a mix of comedy, love, struggle and many different sides of Javier Bardem's brilliance. A must for any Bardem collector! I settled for the 15 year old VHS tape of this movie, played fine, and it was a lot cheaper than trying to obtain the DVD of this movie as those are anywhere from $50 to $150 on amazon or ebay.\n\nNO way would spoil this movie for any fan, it's worth while! I have about 12 Bardem movies now. We became fans after we saw the James Bond movie he was in. We were curious who he was. No we have over a dozen movies from Jamon Jamon to Goya's Ghosts, Love in a time of Choelera and Vicky Christina Barcelona. He has made a lot of movie in this century. In the 1990's he made movies to, and they are HILARIOUS! Just hard to obtain and some are trickier to watch. The Dancer Upstairs, Before the Nite Falls, Second Skin and Live Flesh are other mandatory Bardem movies. The Dancer Upstairs is Incredible also. Start Collecting!",
