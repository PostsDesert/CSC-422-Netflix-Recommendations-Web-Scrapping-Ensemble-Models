        "reviewBody": "\"Pow Wow Highway\" has the true spirit of independent film making as it pushes aside all the bells and whistles of Hollywood and cuts straight to the heart of the matter. And the heart of the matter in this film is a powerful narrative in the form of friendship and family. \"Pow Wow Highway\" takes its audience on a humble, but beautiful journey into the soul of two modern Native American friends. The director, Jonathan Wacks, entertains his audience with a simple yet strong story that never goes beyond its deeper sense of Native American spirituality. The characters portrayed by Gary Farmer and A. Martinez create a contrast in ideals and ideologies that give \"Pow Wow Highway\" a considerable amount of depth and impact that leaves you crying one moment and laughing the next. But it is Gary Farmer's superb performance as Phibert Bono that steals the show and gives this film its most touching and powerful performance. It is to director Jonathan Wacks credit that his camera never strays far from Gary Farmer's character. I found this film to be a bright spot that far out shines the sophistication and capitalistic endeavors of other movies from the same time period. I really believe that the recent success of the independent film movement owes a lot to movies like \"Pow Wow Highway.\" My hat goes off to Jonathan Wack's \"Pow Wow Highway\" as it is a must see movie that strikes at the heart of good, solid film making.",
