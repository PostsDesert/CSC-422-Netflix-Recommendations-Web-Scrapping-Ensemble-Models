The soundtrack insidiously lulls the viewer into a state where the everyday is made beautiful.\n\nThis movie is full of overlooked performances by some of today's best actors, including Forest Whitaker, Harold Perrineau Jr, (who most people know from the OZ HBO series), and Ashley Judd, whose takes one of the smallest roles in the movie but develops an extraordinary character.\n\nHarvey Keitel and William Hurt have a dynamic in each scene that shows the true brilliance of each actor. Stockard Channing plays a character that could easily have been overacted with a style and realism that engage the viewer.\n\nCertainly a movie you have to put yourself into, but you won't be disappointed if you do."
