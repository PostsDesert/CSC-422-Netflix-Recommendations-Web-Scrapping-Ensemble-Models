I like the fact that the camera barely ever moves instead relying on really beautiful long shots that look, in a lot of cases, like paintings. I'm going to make it my mission to see all 11(?) of the films he has directed. Kitano really is just one of those people who can make you forget your watching a movie, the way it all unfolds just feels like something else The acting was reserved but completely convincing, especially between the two main characters, the fact that you could get such a strong sense of character from two people who never speak is really amazing. My appreciation for kitano grows with every film I watch, seek these films out, they're worth it."
