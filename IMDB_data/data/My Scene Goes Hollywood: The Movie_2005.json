I really liked getting to see the girls go through each Hollywood set and how movies are shot.\n\nMadison has annoyed me since the very first movie with the whole cheating thing. Now I hated how Madison treated her friends. I didn't understand why they even bothered to see her or be friends again.\n\nOverall, a nice addition to the My Scene movies!",
