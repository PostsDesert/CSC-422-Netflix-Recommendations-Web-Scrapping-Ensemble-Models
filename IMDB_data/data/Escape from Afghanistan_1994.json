It was made in 1994, but it was \"discovered\" by Roger Corman in 2002, resulting in some makeshift English dubbing (of very poor quality) and a DVD release. It's not a masterpiece of film technique and the small budget shows, but its value is in showing a common soldier's view of the \"Soviet Vietnam\" in Afghanistan."
