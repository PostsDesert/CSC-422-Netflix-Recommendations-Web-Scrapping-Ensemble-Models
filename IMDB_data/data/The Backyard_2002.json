        "reviewBody": "It's about teen and pre-teen boys who emulate their wrestling heroes by staging dirty wrestling bouts in their own backyards in makeshift rings.\n\n The focus is on half a dozen individuals who dream of getting into the big leagues.\n\nThe contestants use light bulbs, barbed wire, non-breakaway chairs and household chemicals to annihilate each other.\n\nThe fights become repetitive after a while.\n\nOne sequence, where the mother of one of the fighters attempts to stop her son from being seriously injured, made me think of some of the opportunities this doco missed.\n\nStill, it holds up a foggy magnifying glass to a fascinating subculture. Technically its crass, but it has some degree of affection for its subjects.\n\nCertainly not a backyard BEYOND THE MAT, but definitely deserving of attention."
