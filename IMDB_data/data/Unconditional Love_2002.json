        "reviewBody": "This film is so many things: corny, touching, hilarious, weepy, maddening...well, you get it - so many things and a really pleasant surprise. I watched it to see Kathy Bates and I fell in love with her talent. Like the movie, she is also many things and shows the complexity of a relatively simple character type (as \"D.S.\" put it - \"an American frump\"). Yes, she was very frumpy, but with a twist...she had real balls throughout the film and from the time her husband gives her the bad news she begins to show herself that she really didn't need him for validation; her strength shows with her first impulsive decision to go to England and then the fun begins. My favorite scenes are when the Fox sisters realize that they are sharing tea with a fan and, of course, Victor Fox's televised funeral. The end scene, while meandering and very maudlin, touched me and seemed the perfect end to an unexpected adventure. My favorite character was the daughter-in-law, Maudey. What a woman! I'll never see little people the same way again...she was very Chicago."
