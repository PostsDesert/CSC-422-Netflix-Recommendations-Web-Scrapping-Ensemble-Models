What follows is their journey and their attempts to evade the law. \n\nWritten and directed by Jim Jarmusch, so you already know this is not going to be a conventional movie. Quirkily funny, with some great off-the-wall characters and good interplay between them. Plot is a bit random, though that's part of the movie's charm. The anarchy of the plot fits in well with the characters and general non-seriousness of the movie. \n\nGood work by Tom Waits, John Lurie and Roberto Benigni in the lead roles.",
