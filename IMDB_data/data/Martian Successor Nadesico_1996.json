It has the solidarity of the characters, combined with excellent animation, voice-acting, and plot to make it one of the best entrances into anime for the uninitiated. It's real treat however, is for the anime veterans, who will see throughout the entire series, parody after parody of series after series of longtime favorites and classics. This show is shameless in parody, filled with comdey and drama, and everyone will love it."
