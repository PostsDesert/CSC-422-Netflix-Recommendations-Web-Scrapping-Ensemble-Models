I couldn't remember a darn thing about it. (and us movie geeks hate that) Every actor in this movie are all \"A\" list. And that alone should keep you watching it. It has some tough parts to get through. But I advise you to stick to the end. I also agree that you have to accept (like Her family) Dreyfus's character for who he is, allow it to be part of the plot. If you can make it through the hard parts, you will be rewarded at the end. And remember this was made before Hollywood killed Frank Sinatra by putting a song of his in every darn movie. This is not a GREAT movie, but a darn good one, with a touching ending."
