        "reviewBody": "Plot- Two unhappy guys consider trading murders to rid themselves of their problem people after seeing Hitchcock's thematically similar 'Strangers on a Train\" (1951).\n\nConsidering the talent involved, the black comedy's disappointing. The main problem's with the repetitive plot that does get tiresome since there's only a minor subplot (Greist) to help carry the 90-minutes of storyline. Thus, comedians Crystal and DeVito's character and shtick are simply repeated over and over-- DeVito, the harassed mother's boy; Crystal, the frustrated writer and would-be murderer. There are, of course, funny moments, but they merely spread out rather than add up.\n\nStill, I've never seen a witchy character as obnoxious as Anne Ramsey; I'm glad she got an award. The screen gets super-charged whenever her boisterous presence appears. Good thing her scenes are framed in humorous fashion. All in all, she steals the movie from the two stars, even bustling bumblebee DeVito. In my little book she's definitely one-of-a-kind.\n\nOverall, it's a movie that doesn't serve its comedy actors well. Fortunately, each would go on to better things."
