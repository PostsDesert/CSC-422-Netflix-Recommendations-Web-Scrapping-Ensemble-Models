        "reviewBody": "I won't say too much just that this is a very good film that is not what you would expect from a romantic comedy. First of all the main character is not your typical African-American lead. I love the fact that the story doesn't chain you to the idea that this is a black man and he should be dating nothing but black women. He's a suburban guy with a mixed parentage who hangs out with and loves people of all different types. This might be the only time I've liked Hill Harper in anything(other than The Nephew). Sandrine Holt, Nicole Parker, and Laurel Holloman are as beautiful as ever and put on worthy performances. This is a fun little film that will definitely surprise some people. Give it a shot.",
