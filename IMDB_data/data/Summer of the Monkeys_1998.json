The movie \"Where the Red Fern Grows\" does not disappoint and is 99% just like the book. Summer of the Monkeys was lazily done. They didn't follow the book and may as well not referred to The Wilson Rawls version. So disappointing I wouldn't let my children watch it , because the writings of Wilson Rawls should be respected as \"Where the Red Fern Grows \" director and producer respected his writing.",
