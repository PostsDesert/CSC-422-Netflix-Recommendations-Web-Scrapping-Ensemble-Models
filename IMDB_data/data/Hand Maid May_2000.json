Her voice definitely suited her character and like it's hard to do a goody too shoes anime girl without being squeaky and over the top but nope, the character was likeable and totally adorable!\n\nI also gotta give an applaud to Robert Martin Klein for voicing Kotaro who's like this type of show off person you really hate but really like at the same time. His over the top personality made you laugh out loud each time with his failed attempt pranks he does to Kazuya.\n\nI normally am not a fan of harem stuff but this one was right up my ally and it is considered one of the good ones out there for me to really like it! I'm giving this bad boy a 8/10!",
