        "reviewBody": "This sequel to \"Bloodfist\" was not my very favorite. I thought the third one was a slight downer, this one was the lowest. The action of the movie was there, but the plot was major stinker. Being convicted of killing a policeman in a traffic accident is bad enough. But when the details are sketchy, there's a chance of high hopes for the character to regain control of his life. When heard most of the details, I hear that the police officer that died in the crash, was drunk. That can clear Danny Holt(Don \"The Dragon\" Wilson) of vehicular manslaughter, however, more rogue cops hamper his chances on redemption. This police Lt. Garcia(Liz Torres) is terrible. She won't listen to anything. She is so hardened against Danny, she don't care about anything else. Maybe one day, she'll learn the truth about open her eyes, and see the error of her views. The action scene remain intact, and the the kitchen scene is unforgettable. Especially when the young woman gets burned on the stove during the fight with Danny. This movie was fine, it just a little downhill there. 1 out of 5 stars.",
