        "reviewBody": "The documentary is interesting, but there is nothing new. Vic Spinetti, who appeared in a few Beatle films is the main interviewee. The movie also seems to focus primarily on John. The biggest issue in this documentary for me is the several lengthy interludes by a band playing old rock and roll, but NOT the Beatles. I understand that these songs were influential to the group and they covered some of those songs early on, but it seems like filler to me. I'm not sure who they are or if they have some direct connection to the Beatles. To top it off the band really sounds sloppy. I give it 5 stars. Would've been 6 or 7 if it wasn't for the musical \"interludes.\"",
