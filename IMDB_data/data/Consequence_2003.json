It's a film drowned in clich√©s, with bad acting and a predictable plot. Almost everything you see is stolen from others movies, even the Herbie-films. Assante is the master of the B-movie. But even he can't rescue this kind of s**t. The change of identity of the Assante-character in the beginning gives away the plot. All the plot twists later on are forced into the screenplay. Although its very violent it's more a movie for young teenagers. This can't be taken serious, if you are a serious film fan. CIA-agents shooting at a Volkswagen in the middle of a square full of people. Can''t believe they do a thing like that. So forget Consequence. It's a C-movie."
