Although married to Verna (Virginia Mayo), Jarrett is overly attached to his equally crooked and determined mother, \"Ma\" Jarrett (Margaret Wycherly), his only real confidante.\n\nBosley Crowther of The New York Times called it \"the acme of the gangster-prison film\" and praised its \"thermal intensity\". Tim Dirks on the website Filmsite.org writes that the film may have also inspired many other successful films.\n\nBottom line: can James Cagney make a bad gangster film? I think not. The only way you can make a gangster film better than a Cagney film, is by having one with Cagney, Paul Muni and Edward G. Robinson. But that is just not going to happen.",
