The camp element was surprisingly funny, considering it was written by a Lesbian, which in my opinion shows that Sara Moore has wonderfully campy and eccentric friends. The main reason I enjoyed the film so much, is to achieve camp, you have to totally believe what you are saying, if you try and be funny, you're not funny. Stephen Sorrentino excelled at this as \"The Donna\" he believed 100% of what he was saying. I have recommended this film to a lot of my friends, and I wish that Sara Moore would direct another chapter of \"Homo Heights.\" John Martin San Diego, CA."
