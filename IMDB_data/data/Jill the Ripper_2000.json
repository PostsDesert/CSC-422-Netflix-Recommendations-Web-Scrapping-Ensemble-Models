        "reviewBody": "Jill the Ripper is Dolph Lundgren's best performance and is unlike any of his other movies. The movie is set in the 1970's and Dolph plays an ex-cop and boxer (Matt Sorenson) whose brother is killed during some kinky sex act. Matt delves into the world of S&M trying to find his brother's killer. This movie was filmed very well. You should see it for the setting and lighting if not for the actual story. Also, the DVD version contains a very interesting director's commentary from the film's director, Anthony Hickox. All of the actors turned in pretty good performances. There are some problems with the movie, the editing is not very well done and it leaves you wondering what is motivating the characters' behaviour, and several of the characters go by 2 or 3 different names which is confusing. Also, you know who the killer is pretty much from the beginning. But overall this is good movie. Some people might say its boring, I say its taking its time; Dolph's character is actually trying to develop. If you want an action Dolph flick where he kills everyone and flexes his muscles, DON'T watch this movie, watch Red Scorpion or Universal Soldier instead. If you want a semi-suspenseful horror flick (and to see Dolph tied up and hanging upside down almost naked during a bizarre sex act) watch this movie. My suggestion is to watch it at least twice. I actually hated it the first time I saw it. I don't know what made me watch it again, but the second time is the charm. Perhaps I was paying more attention the second time.",
