        "reviewBody": "Although, yes, some of the choices in this movie were difficult to understand for most people, it is because they have never been through what Leo went through. As a fellow wrestler this movie appealed immensely to me because i could identify with everything the main character was going through. The dropping weight, the dehydration, and the competition on the mat was depicted flawlessly in this movie because it was made by someone who understands what wrestlers go through. This is not an attack on you personally tommyboy16, but unless you are to go through stuff like dropping weight and starving, and training like that which was depicted in the movie, it will be difficult to understand, but that is not a reflection of the quality of the movie. The overall message appeals to everybody, but the little details of the experiences of the main character will most likely appeal to athletes more. That's all, enough said.",
