        "reviewBody": "The film was based on the play, \"Colored Eggs,\" by Daniel Wright. Lauren Holly played a woman with cancer and a past. Faye Dunaway played a cantankerous older woman who also has cancer. The film is based on the cancer unit at a hospital ward. Lauren Holly's character Amber directed an Easter pageant for the children entitled \"Colored Eggs.\" Tom Skerrit played an admirer of Faye's character. There is a strong supporting cast like Edie McClurg as the nurse and Janet Carroll. The film is depressing at times. Faye's character seems to fight the cancer with all she's got. There are touching moments but weird to have wedding in a cemetery. Faye's character likes cemeteries. The hospital must be next to one according to the story. The film is set between the cemetery and the hospital ward.",
