I read the book and remember it as a lively, interesting fast-paced read, but the movie stays lugged down, even despite the best efforts of the actors involved. I was pleased to watch it though, I was, but couldn't help but make the same comparison most do when watching a film adaptation of a favorite book...it couldn't help but pale in contrast. Anthony Edwards did his best, and it was charming, that was worth watching. Lauren Bacall, Mary Stuart Masterson, Virginia Madsen, Anjelica Huston...all so lovely to watch. I think even if I had not read the book I would have found the film sluggish, but it was sweet to watch.",
