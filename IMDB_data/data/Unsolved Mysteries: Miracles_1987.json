        "reviewBody": "Unsolved Mysteries was one of the most intriguing shows ever on television, sometimes scary, sometimes funny, sometimes heartwarming, sometimes silly, and always interesting. Unsolved Mysteries was given great dignity and style by the late Robert Stack, whose presence and voice made it eminently watchable.\n\nGiven that this was a reality show, it's surprising to me that in the current reality show frenzy, this show hasn't been revived. In its prime-time years, it was canceled, then returned to the air with co-host Virginia Madsen for a season. The rest of the time on the air, it was hosted by only Stack. Lifetime has been running the series for some time now, but they really should produce new episodes. The only problem with that is, who would replace Stack? All that aside, the series was notable for all its reuniting of families, the criminals caught, and its inspirational stories of miracle healings. It also had its share of UFO sightings and ghost stories. With the show off of the air, it's very frustrating because one doesn't know if the unsolved cases were ever solved. \n\nIf you look closely, you'll see Matthew McConaughey as a murder victim.\n\nYou can't get any better than that.",
