The movie has some early Canadian ALANiS hits like \"Too Hot\", \"An Emotion Away\", and remixes of \"Feel Your Love\" (Which she performs at the end!), these songs and her performance/cameo is the only enjoyable parts of the whole film. ALANiS didn't even have to try to steal the spotlight...she must be the only reason this movie is still printed. The rest however is ridiculous far-fetched tripe which is as boring as it is disgusting(ie. The shower scene). When a film features a guy shaving his legs, wearing a long blonde wig, and sporting panty hose, you know you're in for a real \"winner\". The fact that everybody is convinced that this guy is actually a female is incredible, anyone could tell that it's really a guy. The acting is nothing short of pathetic (not including ALANiS), and the plot is ludicrous. Watch this film for one purpose...ALANiS. I would normally rate this movie a 0, but since ALANiS is in it...10. Rock on ALANiS!!!",
