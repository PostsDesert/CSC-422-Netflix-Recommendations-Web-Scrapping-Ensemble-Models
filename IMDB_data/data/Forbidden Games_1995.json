Little more than a vehicle for lots of sex and flesh, the ball gets rolling pretty quickly.\n\nThe only reason I bought (yes, bought) this film in the first place was because of Amy Weber. Amy is one of the more notable models (IMHO), and well worth the price of admission.\n\nOh, you want plot? Not much there, I'm afraid.\n\nJeff Griggs is the \"Psychic Detective\" (and not a very good one). While attempting to solve a murder mystery, beautiful women keep throwing themselves at his feet, for some unknown reason. He's quite amusing, with a style of speech that reminds me of a constipated Clint Eastwood.\n\nI dare not reveal the ending, except to say that it is quite (unintentionally) funny.\n\nCan't wait for Kolobos! :)",
