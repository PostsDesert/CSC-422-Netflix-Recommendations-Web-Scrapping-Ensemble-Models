It's about five girls who are all 17 years old but have remained in their 10 year old bodies and they are all princess's from different realms(The human world, the spirit world, heaven, the demon world, and the fairy world). They all have the goal to become the Platinum Princess, but only one of them can. The different conflicts that the girls have with each other are what makes the show funny (that and the fact that boys are always pointing out Yucie's large forehead). Also the girl's stuarts are guaranteed to make you laugh. Thing only thing I find strange is that two of the girls, Cocoloo(spirit) and Beth(fairy) blush around each other a little too much if you know what I mean. But we'll have to see how this show develops. And this is supposed to be a show for girls, and even though I'm a guy I thoroughly enjoy it.I give this a 7/10."
