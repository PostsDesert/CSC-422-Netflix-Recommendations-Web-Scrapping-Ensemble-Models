Also, there are some clips from the live performances. If yo're a TON fan, you simply have to see this. We've got normal Type O sense of humour and quotes from... Coal Chamber fans, who dislike the best doom metal band of all the time (what a jerks!). What's more, we've got Peter Steele (R.I.P.) telling us about his \"philosophy of life\" (P.S.:I'm really happy_ Interveiwer: Why?_ P.S.:Because I know someday I will die...). And the extended version of \"Christian woman\" - just perfect. Watch out for the \"Jesus Christ looks like me\" moment. It makes me laugh any time I see this.",
