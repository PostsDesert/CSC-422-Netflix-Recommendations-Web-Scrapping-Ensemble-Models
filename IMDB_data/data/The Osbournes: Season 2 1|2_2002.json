        "reviewBody": "Hardly a game. This point and click 'game' is essentially an interactive film where the player chooses from speech opinions which have moderately significant impact upon the narrative. Some of these decisions include things such as choosing which character to save out of two which need help, and breaking a promise made to another character in order to do what you think is right (you can also choose not to promise anything initially, resulting in the character you asking for the promise disliking you, but saving you from greater dislike later), etc. The player's choice of speech and actions for the protagonist changes the way in which non-player characters will behave around and towards the protagonist. The ending will likely stick with you for your the rest of your life.",
