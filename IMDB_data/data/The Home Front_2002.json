The characters are recognizable to anyone who has ever lived in a small town, even if a war isn't going on.\n\nTim Curry is, as usual, superb. Tatum O'Neil is a breath of fresh air from the typical Hollywood fair. I recognized each character driving this film. Also wondered why I'd never heard of it before just discovering it on a video shelf at Blockbuster. Left me wondering how much was true as I was aware of U-boats off the coast of U.S. but didn't know anything about tankers being blown up. Guess I have some research to do. I am recommending it to everyone I know who enjoys real movies, not just effects disguised as a movie.",
