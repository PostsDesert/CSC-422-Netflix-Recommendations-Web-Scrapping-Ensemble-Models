        "reviewBody": "With first season thru, I'm able to say this is one outstanding TV show. I hope there will be a second season, but the first season alone is, as a \"mini series\" amazingly good. Everyday relationship issues handled with extreme care; black humour mixed with ice cold tragedy without ever being pretentious or melodramatic. Excellent shot and with metafilm views to an amount never seen in american television (at least not by me).\n\n OK, i'm biased; I adore both Eric Stoltz and William H Macy, but even if Stoltz is more of an main actor than ever before and extremely important for this show, the show in itself would be substantial without him.\n\nThis show (and its forecasted success-to-be) will probably lead to production companies that take more chances; don't under-estimate their audience, and aim on quality and meaning. Hugh amount of creds to everyone behind this project!"
