My favorite episode was when the construction workers were doing some work in Chris' parent's kitchen, and they taught Chris how to yell out catcalls to women as they passed by. \"Yeah, uh-huh. Pluck that banjo honey. Yeah, you have a very nice skirt on today.\" I hope Rhino comes out with more episodes on DVD."
