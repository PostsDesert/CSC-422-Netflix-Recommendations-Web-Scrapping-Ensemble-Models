This is one of those movies that you'll want to see over & over. The acting was superb. I was so touched by the personalities dynamics of every single character in this film. My favorite genre is drama & I prefer black and white so this was right up my alley. At the end I held my breath & when The End came up on the screen I started crying. I had to watch the whole thing a second time & I will be purchasing the DVD for sure. There wasn't a boring moment and the ending was the best part. I wish there was a sequel! I would of loved to of seen the Major and the shy gal get together slowly as they talk and share moments at the hotel. It would have made a great romance!",
