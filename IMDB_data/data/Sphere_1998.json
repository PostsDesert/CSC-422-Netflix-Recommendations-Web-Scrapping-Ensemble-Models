If you haven't read the book first, the movie will be hard to follow.\n\n The movie follows the book pretty closely. Barry Levinson directs his 2nd Crichton adaptation, following Disclosure. There is a terrific superstar cast. Dustin Hoffman is a legend and has made several great movies with Levinson. Samuel L. Jackson, always fun to watch, is one of the top actors of today. The sexy Sharon Stone here continues to prove how good of an actress she is. \n\nSphere is a very strange, but entertaining movie. I do reccomend reading the book beforehand, though."
