What Catherine Deneuve is to French films, Waheeda Rehman is to Indian films - sensuous, talented, photogenic and ethereal. The Lukhnavi traditions are captured beautifully - the women's quarters and the men forbidden access. The lifting of the veil has two men fall madly in love with the same woman. In the end, as tragedy strikes, Jameela's divorced husband gently pulls the veil back on her face. This scene is worth the price of the DVD. I wish that Guru Dutt had not colorized the title song in this black and white film. Meenu Mumtaz and Tun Tun are great. Johnny Walker does his usual schtick and Rehman and Guru Dutt complete the love triangle.",
