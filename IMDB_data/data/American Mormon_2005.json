Generally polite, the interviewers sometimes get condescending when the general public mistakenly assumes that the LDS still follows its original doctrine.\n\nOverall, this film better serves to highlight the fallacy of composition common in Mormon entertainment. Unoriginal, boring, and providing nothing more than another example of the blindered existence of a very deluded cult in the desert.",
