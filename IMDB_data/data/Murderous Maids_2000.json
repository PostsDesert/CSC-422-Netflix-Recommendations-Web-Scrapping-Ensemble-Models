        "reviewBody": "This is the story of the Papin sisters - whose tale inspired a play by Jean Genet and several earlier movies. This is probably the most historical of any of the previous attempts at the telling. Christine and Lea are sisters from a working class broken family in France, a family that has always been `in service.' When Christine expresses a desire to go into a convent like her older sister, the mother screams, `You'll slave for others the way I have.' As Christine tries to protect her younger sister from the world, her blank face in the presence of her rich employees does little to hide her growing bitterness and rage. Sylvie Testud as Christine gives one of the best performances to be seen in recent years. This is a drama of individuals, and - a rarity in these times - a clearly political drama about class conflict. See it despite the tabloid title given to its U.S. release."
