        "reviewBody": "\"Temps Du Loup\" is probably Michael Haneke's most successful attempt at presenting his bleak outlook on mankind.\n\nVaguely set in a post-apocalyptic world, the film works both ways: a. at isolating various institutions and values (society, family, religion) outside of their normal environment, and therefore analyzing them more thoroughly; b. as an exercise in evoking beautiful imagery out of spartan and plain settings.\n\nWhile the first is certainly no new ground for Haneke (the storyline is less complex than his previous effort, \"La Pianiste\", yet the scope is much grander), the second means that this is his most cinematic and elegant effort yet.",
