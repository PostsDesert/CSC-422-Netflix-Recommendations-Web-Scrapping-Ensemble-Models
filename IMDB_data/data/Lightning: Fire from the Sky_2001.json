John Schneider & Stacy Keach do well in their roles, but as far as acting goes I vote for Gary Sandy's (WKRP In Cincinnati) performance. I just fell in love with his character. His character fit the small town man that you would enjoy drinking coffee with. Science looks like it took a back seat here on logic, but I could be wrong. The ending just seemed too unbelievable and convenient. The stats are correct for the most part as well as advise on being in electric storms. You don't think they used FEDMART in place of WALMART, do you?",
