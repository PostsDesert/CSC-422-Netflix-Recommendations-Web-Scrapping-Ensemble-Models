        "reviewBody": "Sunset Park left me with a half-satisfied appetite, My one problem was that some of it wasn't filmed in Brooklyn itself and it kinda felt like the bad news bears type of movie BUT, there was good humor mostly from Terence DaShon Howard(Biker Boyz, Dead Presidents) as the smoked out power forward whose name \"Spaceman\" fits real well especially the part about his hairstyle. Then there's Talent and Antwon Tanner(Never Die Alone, Brother, The Wood) who go line-for-line in some really funny moments. The relationship between the young players is pretty realistic and it really shows when they're on the cheese-bus. De'Aundre Bonds(Tales From The Hood, The Wood) isn't too shabby and has one particular scene that I favored and was able to understand. Also the movie has good cinematography, good music and an un-cliched ending(even tho' sometimes cliches don't ruin films)\n\nSunset Park could've been a lot better than it was but then again it wasn't all cheese neither and can be put up with, either way it doesn't exceed Above The Rim..."
