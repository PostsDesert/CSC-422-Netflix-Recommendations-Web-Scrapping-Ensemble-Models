Well, it's Ranma, and for those of you who love Ranma, you must think this movie's like the toast of the town [or whatever phrases y'all use]. But, looking at it objectively, it's a horrid story. I am of the unfortunate few who don't understand Japanese and have to wait for english dubbed releases of movies, but when you get right down to it, this movie wasn't a great piece of writing. The beginning opens with I think just about every Ranma TV-show character ever made, but then they all vanish so you can get to the real story, which is your standard, \"Girl gets kidnapped, it's up to Guy/Girl to rescue her!\" It contains a few choice moments (prince Kirin eating meat!) but other than that, it's a pretty lame movie.\n\nBut to fans it's great!\n\nI voted it a 4 because the second Ranma movie is better by leaps. [Not bounds, just leaps]",
