        "reviewBody": "\"A Better Way to Die\" is a macho little testosterone rush \"sleeper\" which follows a square jawed, lean and cut, sissy-voiced ex-cop as he wades through more \"heavies\" than a Weight Watchers convention. With two firefights even before credits, this terse action jammed drama with a sense of humor has an ever increasing body count as its rather ordinary good guys vs bad guys plot unfolds with cops, FBI, and mobsters duking it out and our reluctant hero invariably caught in between. The viewer is given a personal score to settle when the mob prematurely robs us of more vistas of Henstridge skin and good guys turn bad, bad guys turn good, bullet casings pile up, and the film waxes bloodier all the way to its conclusion. \"A Better Way to Die\" is best served with a sixer and big bag of chips.",
