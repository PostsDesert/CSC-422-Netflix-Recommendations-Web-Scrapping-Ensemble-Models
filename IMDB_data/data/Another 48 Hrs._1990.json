Its pure vintage entertainment!\n\n'Another 48 Hrs.'Synopsis: Jack Cates once again enlists the aid of ex-con Reggie Hammond--this time, to take down The Iceman, a ruthless drug lord operating in the San Francisco bay area.\n\n'Another 48. Hrs' has a brisk pace, which does the trick. At a crisp 95-minutes, the sequel doesn't waste time & comes to the point pretty fast. Of course, a few sequences in the first-hour could've been better, but in totality, the narrative isn't loose. \n\nJohn Fasano, Jeb Stuart & Larry Gross's Screenplay is not without its minuses, but overall, its good. Walter Hill's Direction is effective. Cinematography is razor-sharp. Action-Sequences are awesome.\n\nPerformance-Wise: The Incomparable Nick Nolte steals 'Another 48 Hrs'. He's rough, heroic & lovable all through. Eddie Murphy is spontaneous, as ever. The on-screen camaraderie between Nolte & Murphy, remains as a high-point for the enterprise. \n\nOn the whole, 'Another 48 Hrs' works.",
