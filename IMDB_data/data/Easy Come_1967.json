        "reviewBody": "A frogman (Elvis) working for the Navy discovers treasure in a sunken ship and once he becomes an ordinary citizen he sets out to retrieve it; but he's got competition for it. \n\nOne of Elvis's later entries; quite shallow and cheesy but fairly enjoyable. The slapstick humor works OK in parts and there's an underlying comic jab at the hippie lifestyle that's well played out. There are also some impressive underwater sequences here; \"Easy Come, Easy Go\" is a little more visually compelling than other Presley flicks around this time. \n\nThe songs are few but pretty good (6 in total) and many have commented on \"Yoga is as Yoga Does\" as Elvis's most embarrassing moment on film. Personally I think nothing can top his singing to the dogs in \"Paradise, Hawaiian Style\" but I also think the Yoga moment here is pretty funny and the song OK; in a cheesy sort of way. You gotta admire how the King was a professional through and through and pulled this off and manages to be funny as well in his bungled Yoga attempts.",
