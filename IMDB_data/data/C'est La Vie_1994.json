Some yokes are subtly prepared for quite some time, and are probably being missed, if attention wanders to what Niki or Ariana are up to these days. On the other hand this feature is a great pleasure for people with some patience. It shows a lot of respect and understanding for its characters, and even the annoying ones get their moments of greatness. Its humour is far away from embarrassing its protagonists, and the laughter stems from compassion not farts.",
