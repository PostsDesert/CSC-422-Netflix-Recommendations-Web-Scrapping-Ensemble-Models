And I really did not know what to expect.\n\nAll creatures great and small is about as small town vet in the Yorkshire Dales based on a series of books by James Herriot. The opener of the Masterpiece on PBS is truly charming truly heartwarming. Everything you want a British masterpiece PBS show to be, with fabulous characters , endearing animals, wit and humor. Fabulous cinematography of the Yorkshire Countryside that I found to be spectacular.\n\nThis is quality fellow feeling television, coming right when I could really use it. I'm very much looking forward to see where this masterpiece on PBS series takes me emotionally. This is great television . Happy 50th Anniversary Masterpiece Theatre on PBS .",

Chronicling the heartwarming and humorous adventures of a young country vet, the books introduced readers to his unconventional mentor and the cast of farmers and townsfolk who lived and worked in the Yorkshire Dales in the 1930s.\n\nThis new television adaptation will preserve the rich spirit, tone and values of Herriot’s iconic characters and stories and will bring to life his sharply observed, entertaining and incredibly funny tales of country life in the North of England for a modern audience, introducing a new generation to his life-affirming stories.",
