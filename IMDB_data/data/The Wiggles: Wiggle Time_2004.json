The lack of a lengthy story line or sketch is consistent with the attention span of toddlers. My then toddler son watched the old version and enjoyed it very much. My toddler granddaughter watches the current version and enjoys it very much. I know this because they are the intended audience and they stay tuned and follow along with the songs. Based on their write-up, perhaps shows which appeal to a child, are better suited for the previous reviewers.",
