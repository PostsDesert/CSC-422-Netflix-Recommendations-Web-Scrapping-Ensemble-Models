She plays Randy Dean, a girl who lives on the wrong side of the tracks, and is not particularly pretty. She smokes weed, fails her classes, and likes loud rock music.\n\nShe runs into Evie (Nicole Ari Parker in her debut performance) and they slowly fall in love. Now, Evie takes trips to Paris with her mother, listens to opera, and is well-read and well educated.\n\nTwo more opposite girls you cannot imagine.\n\nYes, it is romantic, but it becomes so funny at the end that you forget that while you are laughing yourself silly.",
