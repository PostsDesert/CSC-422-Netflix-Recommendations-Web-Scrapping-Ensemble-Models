        "reviewBody": "This film is set before the first Alpha Street Fighter film and is mainly about Akuma (Gouki) and Ryu. Other street fighter characters make appearances but they seem just put in and not really relevant to the main story, Ken and Sakura. You do get to see Akuma's brother Gouken and their master Goutetsu. All in all quite short which seems to be good as this is not that entertaining, the story moves very slowly along. The animation is different to the first Alpha film which is good cause that was plain terrible. So Capcom seemed to get one thing right in this prequel. But shouldn't be considered a whole street fighter film as not many of the characters are present.\n\nI give it 5 out of 10 and only because the intro fight scene and music at the start was pretty entertaining.",
