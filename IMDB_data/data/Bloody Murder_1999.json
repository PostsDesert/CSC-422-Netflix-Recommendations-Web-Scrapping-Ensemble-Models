It didn't have much blood and gore, and what blood was shown looked like red spray paint. Less than half of the characters were killed. This movie strongly resembles the form of the early 80's slasher, \"He Knows You're Alone\". It had the potential to be really good and it wasn't. If you're a hard core horror fan looking for a modern camp slasher, rent it, you may like it, but you'll probably be disapointed. 6 out of 10.",
