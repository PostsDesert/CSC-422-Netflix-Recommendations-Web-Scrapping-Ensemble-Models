        "reviewBody": "\"Look Who Is Talking Too\" is not a sequel to the enjoyable \"Look Who Is Talking\" it's a clone. A weak, pale imitation clone, but a clone none the less. It was inevitable that following the success of a \"Look Who Is Talking\" that a sequel would follow. It was also inevitable that the sequel would be of inferior quality. \n\nPlot in A Paragraph: Mollie (Kirstie Alley) and James (John Travolta) are together and raising a family, which now consists of an older Mikey (voiced by Bruce Willis) and his baby sister, Julie (Roseanne Barr)\n\nAll the charm of the original movie is missing, what made the first movie so good was it was new, fresh and original. This is more of the same but without the originality, freshness, and newness. Instead it has Roseanne Barr. \n\nMy God, her voice is annoying!! The script is weak, Travolta and Alley do not enjoy the same chemistry as in the first movie (which is a shame) Bruce Willis remains fun, but that is about it!!",
