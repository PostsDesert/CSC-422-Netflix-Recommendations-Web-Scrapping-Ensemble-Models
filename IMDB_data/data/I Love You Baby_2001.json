        "name": "Average comedy and drama with a trio of sympathetic actors playing eccentric characters",
        "reviewBody": "This typical story about a gay country boy called Marcos (Jorge Sanz) who meets a boy named Daniel (Santiago Magill) . But then boy gets hit in head while singing karaoke in a discotheque . Later on , boy loses boy to girl . As Marcos falls for attractive single mother called Marisol (Tiaré Scanda) , a likable Dominican girl who meets her good-looking suitor . But Daniel is unwilling to relinquish Marcos so easily and things go awry . What will he do? . Daniel does one last desperate effort to get his ex-boyfriend , now as transvestite to reclaim his sweetheart . Everything that you can imagine is far from the stupid things that may happen him , as it results in the happenings turn upside down . One story , two loves . Three lovers . Four dreams. \n\nRomantic Spanish Dramedy (Comedy and Drama) with nice actors , charming South American songs , love stories , and mediocre direction . Fun and uplifting Spanish romantic comedy with crazy events , amusement and absurd situations . This entertaining film packs amusement , comical as well as dramatic situations , tongue-in-cheek , surrealist comedy including conventional pitfalls and many other things . This is a slightly funny film with entertaining events , giggles , emotion , twists and triangular love stories . The film moves in fits and starts most of which would be desirable , with more traps the viewer resists any kind , and some moments of enjoyment and others quite a few ridiculous . Humor is sometimes cheesy and gross-out with numerous naughty and picaresque situations such as sex jokes , bad taste and adult scenes . This is a special Spanish comedy from the 2000s with the usual ingredients such as twisted humor topped with a little bit of original touches here and there and the tone of the film is light-hearted . It's an agreeable , moving as well as lightweight comedy with brief touches of drama , professionally acted and concerning the narration about the relationship among fiancée , fiancés and a transvestite . Sitting in a strange middle ground between the completely absurd and the stylishly cool . Main actors are acceptable , though Jorge Sanz is miscast . Support cast is frankly well such as Verónica Forque , Alicia Agut , Laura Ramos and cameo by two singers : Dani Martin of ¨El Canto Del Loco¨ and Boy George of ¨Culture Club¨. This is a fast crazy movie with lot of fun situations , antics , bemusement and with a bunch of offbeat roles . This is another Spanish drama/comedy romp , it is a bemusing story that contains lots of humor , entertainment , and involving gays , immigrants , lower class people , workers , stage actors and many other things . A film rich in troublesome loving stories , where love is the central theme seen from various points of view , as from homosexuality or ordinary Hispanic-South American couple . It has some moments of enjoyment as well as amusement and others quite a few embarrassing . Regular and unbalanced , but gaining the sympathy almost at all times . This is an agreeable as well as uneven comedy in less than 110 minutes of length and yet with an air of naturalness and credibility rarely match . \n\nColorful photography in juicy atmosphere by Gonzalo Berridi , deemed to be one of the best Spanish cameramen , he has photographed successes such as ¨El Viaje De Carol¨, ¨Amantes Circulo Polar¨ , ¨Ardilla Roja¨ , ¨Camaron¨ and ¨8 Apellidos Vascos¨. Lively and catching musical score filled with marvelous songs , and Dominican music such as ¨Bachata¨and ¨Merengue¨ . The motion picture was middlingly directed by Alfonso Albacete and his partner David Menkes . They are good writers and directors , being expert on comedies and dramas dealing with gay world and young people . Both of whom are especially known for Más Que Amor, frenesí (1996), Atomica (1999) Sobreviviré (1999) and Mentiras y Gordas (2009).",
