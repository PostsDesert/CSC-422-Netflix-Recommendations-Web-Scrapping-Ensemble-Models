I'm usually bored in 15 minutes. I have to say it's a fresh take on a typical show subject. I think the casting was well done. I like the main characters and I really think the back story ads so much. I love the dog interaction and I actually like that it's clean but not unrealistically so. I'm usually watching some like DEXTER, so again I'm surprised. The writing is pretty good including the script. There is a wit to it that is well delivered by the cast. I'm on episode three so let's hope it keeps my interest. P.s. I love the dog side kick.",
