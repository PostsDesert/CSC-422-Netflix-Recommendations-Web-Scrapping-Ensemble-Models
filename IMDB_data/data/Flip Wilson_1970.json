        "reviewBody": "After the Flip Wilson show left the air, having been a top favorite for a full four years, it was quickly forgotten.\n\nTV Land fortunately has revived the series, and what a pleasure it is to tune in weekly for these delightful shows. The skits are genuinely funny, with hilarious lines concocted by a stable of great comic writers.\n\nFlip himself is wonderful to watch. He appears so innocent and good natured, and delivers his material effortlessly. He is a \"natural\" in the comic arena.\n\nThe finest of guest stars clamored for a spot on his series, and Wilson appears cool and comfortable with all of them.\n\nSo what happened that he was so quickly forgotten? The same reason the series is soon out of mind till the next show during this revival. It's like a nice desert: great while being consumed, which lasts for a short time only.\n\nThe private life of Flip is an intriguing thought, since he apparently was an intensely private person. Then again, maybe that's all there was to him, and what we saw was what we got."
