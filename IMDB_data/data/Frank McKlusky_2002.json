He even looks a little like Jim Carrey>\n\nSome good comedy talent in the cast, but if they had it to do over again, I'll be they'd all pass. Too stupid to be funny. I don't know if it was a lack of money, time, or possible the director was inept, or the editing was done at the Hemp Users Society Annual Expo.\n\nWhatever it was, it resulted in a movie that is a waste of time. Fortunately, I didn't pay to buy or rent this flick. It was on one of my cable channels. Not recommended."
