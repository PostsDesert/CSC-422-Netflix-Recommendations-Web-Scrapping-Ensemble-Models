The only thing that brings him back around the world of the living is (the only thing any of us really need for happiness)... Love.\n\nFor me, that is one of the most pertinent and beautiful things that someone with a voice in society can say.\n\nP.S. It is highly likely that if anyone found this film 'too depressing' than they are not really primed to expect anything other than the beauty and predictability of\n\nhollywood film. And in response to the chap who refutes the existence of such misery in the real world: you are obviously a lucky, privileged chap."
