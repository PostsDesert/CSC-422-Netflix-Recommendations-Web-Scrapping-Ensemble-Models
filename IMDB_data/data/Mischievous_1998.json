He does not like stupid girls and sadly she is not very clever and is accident prone as well. They both have other people who like them and friends and family who support or oppose the possibility her charm could win him over. This is a light romantic comedy which is easy viewing, I do wish they had made the lead a little less cold as for most of the series I just became frustrated that she loved him no matter how he treated her. That said a good supporting cast and the endearing charm of Jung So-min makes it worth a watch.",
