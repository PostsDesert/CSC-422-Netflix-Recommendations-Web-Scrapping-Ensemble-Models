        "reviewBody": "\"Andaaz\" remains one of the forgettable movies of the recent past, owing to its poor story and its delivery. A love triangle combined with the story of family and faith could have been obviously presented better had the script or characters been worked out better. Here the story and narration don't look much interesting and performances are yet a major let down. Akshay Kumar had done many such average and forgettable movies in the time which won't be a major debacle in his filmography. Among two heroines, Lara Dutt looks a bit good in her latter role; whereas Priyanka Chopra in her first film gets unnoticed owing to a very weak and half cooked role. Overall it's a very routine film from Raj Kanwar, who has given better films like \"Humko Deewane Kar Gaye\" or \"Judaai.\" \n\nRating: 1 star out of 4",
