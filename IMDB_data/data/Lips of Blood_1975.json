        "reviewBody": "The movies of Jean Rollin are an acquired taste. He specializes in haunting, sensual, visually impressive movies that frequently concern memory, or memory loss, and obsessively feature beautiful naked women, usually vampires. Maybe Rollin's therapist can fully explain why his movies deal with this subject matter over and over, but hey, I don't care, it sure works for me! If you haven't seen any of his work, 'Lips Of Blood' is as good a place to start as any, but frankly I've never seen a bad movie by him yet. They're all good. I'm hooked!\n\nJean-Lou Philippe stars (and co-scripts) as a thirty something man who becomes obsessed with a photograph which reminds him of of his almost-forgotten childhood, which is sketchy at best. He attempts to track down the location in the picture, and this brings back memories of a beautiful and mysterious girl (the lovely Annie Belle/Briand, who also worked with Deodato and D'Amato) he once met. He finds himself uncovering a family secret and his life goes in a direction he could never have anticipated.\n\n'Lips Of Blood' is yet another wonderfully evocative, dream-like film from Jean Rollin. A truly unique film maker who creates fascinating worlds that are both seductive and dangerous. Rollin is one of the best kept secrets in horror, and a master of erotic fantasy."
