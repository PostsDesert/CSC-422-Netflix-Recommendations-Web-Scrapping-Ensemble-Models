        "reviewBody": "I quite liked this film, apart from the later UK 'setting' and how the story skirted close to glorifying the IRA. Christine Lahti portrayed a strong character whose life fell apart not once, but about three times, whilst discovering the truth about the death - and life - of her pilot husband. And Glasgow-born Kirsty Mitchell was strangely compelling as Muire ('M-yoo-ire', as Lahti's character stumbled with). I felt like the film should have ended a scene or two before it actually did, and I don't know what Lahti's character established by visiting Ireland, but the rest of the story kept me hooked. I also admired how an obvious scene was avoided, in the hotel room between Kathryn and the union rep (is that what he was? Did he turn out to be some kind of government agent in the end? Not sure). The contrast between the wife's broken memories of her husband - shining his shoes, waving goodbye in full uniform, playing happily with the daughter - and the uncovered truth was dramatic and well filmed. The London and Ireland 'locations' (in Halifax, Nova Scotia) were tired and the stuff of American mythology - did somebody in the pub actually say 'Guv'nor'? - but that was the only real failing. I'll definitely read Anita Shreve's novel, to compare the two versions. The comments on airport security and terrorism did not escape deeper consideration either, after last year's tragic events."
