But after seeing this movies this illusion of my mind is being cleared.The character Priya falls in love with a guy Rahul.She loves her from the bottom of her heart but the Rahul just plays with her innocence. When she involves with Rahul she was just a young girl. But when she got to know that she was pregnant and the society, her parents & all of the above Rahul is not going to accept that child she takes the decision to earn for herself and for her baby. This was the turning point of her life. This is the real courage I am impressed with. No one of us has this kind of courage to accept our own mistakes like this, that it doesn't look like a mistake, but sets a great example for the society. Because all of the above society, Parents and all the human creatures there is god who is in your heart. You do right or wrong just be true to yourself and he(God) will accept you in every manner.",
