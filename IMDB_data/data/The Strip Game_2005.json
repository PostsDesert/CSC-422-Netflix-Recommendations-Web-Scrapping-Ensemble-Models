From the opening you know that it's nothing more than a gangster rappers attempt at marketing himself.\n\nIt goes from Stripping clips blasting rap music, to rappers talking..like rappers talk, to maybe 2-3 minutes of actual strippers talking about their lives and back to strip clips. repeated for an hour or so.\n\nAny message in this movie is destroyed by the idiotic rappers. Maybe someday someone who knows how to make a documentary will touch upon the subject again without egotistical asses putting themselves infront of the camera for literally most of the actual talking during the movie.\n\nThis doesn't deserve the 1 I gave it."
