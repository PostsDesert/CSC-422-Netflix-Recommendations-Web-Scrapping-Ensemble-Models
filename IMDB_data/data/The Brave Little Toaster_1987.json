        "reviewBody": "Having seemingly been abandoned in their country cottage by their owner, five small household appliances (radio, lamp, blanket, vacuum cleaner, and toaster) set out cross-country on a journey to find their master, a young boy. Along the way, the five appliances encounter various adventures and trials, like a waterfall, a pond with frogs, and a fat little repairman.\n\nIn the transference of human emotion to everyday objects, the story's theme is the yearning to be included, to be relevant, to be needed and loved. The five adventurers display varying human traits. Radio is the most verbal, and something of a comic. Blanket is a tad snugly and sentimental. Kirby the vacuum cleaner is proud and brave. Lamp is \"light\"-hearted and upbeat. Toaster seems the most ... \"grounded\" with common sense.\n\nThe film makes these low-tech appliances sympathetic and heroic. But contrast, the \"cutting-edge\" electronics are portrayed as mean and possibly deceptive. I wouldn't disagree with that.\n\nColor visuals are fine. Animation is acceptable. Even though the lyrics to some of the songs are hard to understand, I like the soundtrack, especially \"Trutti-Frutti\", \"B-Movie Show\", and \"Mammy\". I don't quite understand the rationale for including multiple references to Roosevelt. And radio is forever referring to past historical events. I'm not sure why.\n\nEntirely appropriate for kids, \"The Brave Little Toaster\" works for adults too, mostly through its all-too-human emotional themes, and as a pleasant change from real-life actors, their dramas, and their careers."
