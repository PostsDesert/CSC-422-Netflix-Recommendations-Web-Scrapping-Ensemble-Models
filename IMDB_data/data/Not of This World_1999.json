This event creates new questions for her, for Ernesto (who thinks to be Fausto's father) that Caterina contacts trying to find Fausto's mother. The life is often confined in roles, \"uniforms\", that help people to survey. When something strange happens, people must go outside the uniforms to find a higher level of passion, love and life. These profound thoughts are suggested by mean of a \"light\" movie.\n\nMargherita Buy is the best nun I've ever seen at the cinema.",
