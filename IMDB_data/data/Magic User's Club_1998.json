        "reviewBody": "When I first started this series, I got the first volume as a Christmas Gift from my friend. I watched the first two episodes, and they were very funny. The first episode was so funny, there was this one line about Aburatsubo (note:) He's a guy, that the most funniest line I heard. In the second episode, Takakura's worst enemy Miyama aka:\"The Wicked Witch of the West\", had flowers growing out of her hair because Akane used Magic on her. Now that's funny. What would Akane do next? Have branches growing out of Miyama's hands? That would be funny and Miyama would be a human tree.I know in some of the episodes on the other volumes of the series, Sai has some problems with her magic,even on her broom that she flies on.Takakura always tell her to be in herself and if she doesn't, her magic will not work. Also Akane sometimes doesn't show up for club meetings because she has something else to do instead of being in the club. She probably lied about being in the club in the first place. Even in episode 3, she used forbidden magic like she was told not to. But would she listen? Answer: No,she wants to get herself in lots of trouble. Takakura told his members\"A magician should not use his/her magic for greed and Revenge and other such things. The series get more interesting after that. After the first 6 episodes. The series get more interesting. There's also a giant cherry blossom tree and a ghost of the tree.(Note): The tree was once the bell that invaded earth which sent eyes, whirlybirds, and tops to spy on activity in Tokyo. Some of the episodes in the show can freak you out. The show features the voices of: \"Misty Daniels,Jamie McGonnigal,Kevin Collins,Nicole Tieri,Lisa Ortiz famous for Yu-Gi-Oh!,Mike Pollack,Michael Tremain, and Suzanne Gilad. So in closing to this review. Add this series to your collection and be careful, some episodes can freak you out. You will see what I mean."
