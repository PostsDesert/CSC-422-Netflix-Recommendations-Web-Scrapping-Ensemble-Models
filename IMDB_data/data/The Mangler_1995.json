I saw what i wanted to see, there are movies that tease you with \"horror\" but never show real juicy things, for example the movie \"its alive\" is about that baby creature but they never show us the baby, but this one did just enough. The only small problem i had was the characters are a bit cartoonish like the way robert englund's character speaks sounds too fake, we are far from freddy for sure. Besides all that, the story is entertaining because freak accidents like that can happen in real life and it gives me chills.",
