        "reviewBody": "This moving film charts the life of an icon from birth to death. It is interspersed with a comments by her daughter, friends and colleagues, and gruelling documentary footage. After her success in The Blue Angel, Dietrich becomes an emancipated femme fatale, actress and singer. In the 1930s, she flees Berlin to join the German-Jewish exiles in America and protest against anti-Semitism and the Third Reich. Her fluctuating roles in movies are dependent on the political climate of the times. In the 1940s, she risks her life to entertain thousands of troops on the front-line and is devastated when she witnesses the Belsen atrocities. Sixteen years after the war, she returns to Berlin on a concert tour to an ambiguous reception: she is attacked by the press as a traitor and worshipped by fans. An ageing star in Israel, she wins an ovation for her poignant performance of Lili Marlene. I highly recommend this haunting film which is directed by the star's grandson.",
