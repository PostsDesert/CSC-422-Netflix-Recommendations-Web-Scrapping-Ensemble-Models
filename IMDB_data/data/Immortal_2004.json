        "reviewBody": "Director Enki Bilal is a supremely skilled comic book artist from the same stylistic school as Moebius (who influenced the visual style of Blade Runner and designed part of Alien).\n\nBilal's comics are invariably sombre, textured, exquisitely drawn worlds with strong internal logic.\n\n\"Immortel\" is the film adaptation of the \"Nikopol\" trilogy of comics by Bilal. This trilogy of comics I highly recommend.\n\nThe film opens with some lovely CGI sequences: Nice environment and craft - gritty, textured, dystopia, a catchy steam punk take on the Blade Runner aesthetic.\n\nThe main characters work well in this setting, especially the fetchingly beautiful Linda Hardy (a former Miss France).\n\nBut without warning the quality drops jarringly -- as a host of secondary CGI characters are introduced.\n\nWhat you thought was a movie, suddenly turns into something resembling a video game cut-scene: The amateurishly animated, dated CGI characters would be booed out of Tron. The voice acting is awful. The lip sync a joke.\n\nTo really grind it in, the CGI actors get lots of close-ups. Painful.\n\nThe plot progresses through a series of surreal events in a New York of the future. If you haven't read the comic, things won't make too much sense on first viewing.\n\nStick around for the ride, for there are a number of very successful scenes in this movie -- a hauntingly beautiful museum sequence, some fine sci-fi thrills, a gritty symbolist apartment in which a dreamlike love story takes place. Atmospheric music, too.\n\nThe really good stuff is invariably bookended by poor scenes, including the worst CGI explosions you'll ever see, awful dialog, and tinny sound effects that suddenly intrude on an otherwise coherent sound design.\n\nThis has got to be most uneven movie I've ever seen.\n\nBut give the comic books a go."
