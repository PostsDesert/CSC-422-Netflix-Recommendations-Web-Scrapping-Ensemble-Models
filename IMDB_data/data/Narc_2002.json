        "reviewBody": "NARC (2002) **** Ray Liotta, Jason Patric, Chi McBride, Krista Bridges, Busta Rhymes, Anne Openshaw, Alan Van Sprang, Richard Chevolleau, John Ortiz. Filmmaker Joe Carnahan delivers the gritty goods in this throwback homage to 1970s cop thrillers the likes made by Sidney Lumet and William Friedkin with this moralilty play about corruption, the brutal slaying of an undercover cop and some skeletons rattling around in closets shared by volatile detective Liotta (in one of his fiercest performances to date; a career high) and Patric (equally compelling; the film's barometer of fair game and confusion), a vice undercover cop attempting to redeem his reputation by being assigned to a dicey investigation of the murder of Liotta's protégé partner with more at stake than meets the eye. Carnahan's script is above average in its no-holds barred depiction of the stress-levels of on the job performances by police as well as the dire consequences for their actions and reactions thereof. High adrenalized from the get-go with one of the most pulse-quickening opening moments of any movie in recent memory that continues its brisk pacing and bruised cinematography by Alex Nepomaniaschy and modulated score by Cliff Martinez has a unique look and sound. Its two principals deliver award calibre performances in a genre flick that's more than a cut above from the usual offerings. Produced by Liotta and Tom Cruise (among others); one of the year's best."
