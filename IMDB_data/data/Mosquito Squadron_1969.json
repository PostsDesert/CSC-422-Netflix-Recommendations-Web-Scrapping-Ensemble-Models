        "reviewBody": "This must rank as one of the worst of the 60s war movies.. Seemingly stitched together from stock footage of '633 Squadron' and 'Operation Crossbow', a poor attempt to cash in on the former's success. Unconvincing, hackneyed script - appallingly acted by actors who should have known better. Even the music attempts to 'ape' 'Battle of Britain'.. David Mc Callum is even allowed to keep his 'Ilya Kuryakin' haircut... fine for 1969, but not 1944! Its one saving grace; some original flying shots of that most beautiful aircraft, the De Haviland Mosquito."
