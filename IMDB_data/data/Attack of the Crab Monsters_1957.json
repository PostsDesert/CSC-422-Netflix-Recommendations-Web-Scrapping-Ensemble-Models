        "reviewBody": "In the late 1960's, television independents were not what they are today. They, the local stations, had little, to no money for quality program broadcasts. One of the tricks that many of these stations had was to strip, for a five day run, a low budget movie. Attack of the Crab Monsters was one of them. I loved the film as a child. Even though I was at such a young age, I could still comprehend how poorly this film was produced. Nevertheless I marveled at it's wonderful imagination.\n\nAfter viewing it recently, I realized how special this film really is. Remember now, it has been almost 20 years since I saw this feature and while I was expecting to look at this work with nostolgic dismay, I was very surprised that it was so much fun to watch.\n\nForget logic, decent special effects or good acting, you won't find any of those things here. What you will find however, is a campy silly yarn with crabs that eat the brains of humans and by doing so, gain their knowledge and personality. \n\nThe crabs have wonderfully scarey faces. And believe it or not personality. Too bad this film is so hard to come by. \n\nIf there is, but, one hideously produced film, for you to see in you life time, make it Attack Of the Crab Monsters."
