        "reviewBody": "The film is interesting, of course -it tells about the rise of Nazi power. But this is the less \"bergmanian\" film of Ingmar Bergman. It's not an intimate portrait of people -as the Swedish director always does. Here we have a big budget movie, with many actors... Although the presence of Liv Ullmann, Bergman loses his targets. On one side he wants to analyze a period, on the other one he has to follow more mainstream rules -because he works for a big budget production. As a result he \"fails\" (it's a big word) in both things -although the film is not a failure.\n\nWe feel Ingmar Bergman is not really at ease. This is not his natural dimension -he's a super director because he has an extraordinary ability of understanding neurosis and anxieties, his favorite context are the relationships among a few people. In \"The Serpent's Egg\" these trademark are really minor.",
