Maybe it should have been a 6 hour miniseries or maybe a TV series along the lines of 'Twin Peaks'. It is based on a little known, but critically acclaimed book. I've watched this film four times and each time I have picked up more minutiae. More subtle things that are linked and that make the story more appealing.\n\nThe film is about many things... A mysterious death. Simple midwest farm community life. Midnight racism. Ghosts and a long forgotten cemetery. Family history. In the end, it is about coming home.\n\nThis film is NOT for everyone. Many will not like it or see the subtle depth it has. It will, however, treat those who 'get it' to a hidden little gem.",
