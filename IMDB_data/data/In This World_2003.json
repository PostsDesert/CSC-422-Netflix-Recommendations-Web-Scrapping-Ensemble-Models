        "reviewBody": "Started a bit slow, and it seemed like it was trying too hard with the so-called cringe humor. I still enjoyed the photography, editing and music even though I wasn't impressed with the plot. Then things changed dramatically for the better. One thing I noticed towards the ending was the similarities with \"The Shining\" (1980) both in set and music. Might have been wishful thinking but my I'm pretty sure there's a bit of a reference there.\n\nFantastic acting, I didn't realise the main character was played by the \"Heavenly Creatures\" (1994) actress. Never really seen her \"black, beautiful little eyes\" since then, but her average mid-thirties woman looks were very refreshing for a leading character in a motion picture. Elijah Wood always delivers of course, he was hilarious as a very specific loser type.\n\nOverall a very, very good dark comedy with existential overtones, nice plot turns and a great atmosphere. Loved it.",
