What's not to like?\n\nI saw it again, and paid more attention to some of the finer details, realizing what a rich, full textured film it was.\n\nAnd yet again I saw it. Still more revelations.\n\nIn fact, every time I see it, and I'm sure to see it again, I enjoy it more and more with each subsequent viewing.\n\nThis film's narrative is nearly as perfect as the Hula Hoop itself, despite the albeit fictional account of the invention of said \"dingus\".\n\nBut it strikes me as odd and unfortunate when I encounter someone who's seen this and not enjoyed it.\n\nAll I can say is, have you tried it more than once? It isn't exactly what I'd call an acquired taste, but when you see how rich in detail and humour it is, you may begin to appreciate it for what it truly is; a great film that deserves a second chance.
