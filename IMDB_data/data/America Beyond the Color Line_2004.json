I think we can all see the cycle of love or need for love can also take us down a path which leads to poverty and desperation. If it can lead to poverty, an ill-pursuit of money and drugs, incarceration or worse, it is my personal experience to see that it also leads to new life in one form or another. There are so many major consequences to falling in love which can stand some attention, or at least as much attention as race, public housing, social welfare, education and politics. The birth of a child is the beginning, and sustaining that life is real responsibility."
