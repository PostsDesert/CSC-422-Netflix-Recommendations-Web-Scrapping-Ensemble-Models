It's been a while since seeing this film, but to write this review I re-watched it, and remembered everything I loved about it.\n\nDrew Barrymore is a great actress, and this role suited her really well at the time. The chemistry between Sam and Josie was really good, and Michael Vartan was an excellent actor in this.\n\nI loved the storyline too - as i said up there, I could relate, and it's rare you find a film you can completely relate to.\n\nAll over - I loved it. 7/10",
