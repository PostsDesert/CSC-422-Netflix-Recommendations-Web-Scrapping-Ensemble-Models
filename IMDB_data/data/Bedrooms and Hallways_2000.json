        "reviewBody": "This may have been intended as some sort of celebration of the human animal's sexual diversity, but as such it fails to do anything more than skim the surface. We are ponderously asked to accept that the gay boy gets the girl in the end, and that the straight blokes end up in bed with each other. \"Does kissing her make me a het?\" Kevin McKidd asks of his housemate - a flaming archetype exquisitely performed by Tom Hollander - after a bout of heavy petting with his new boyfriend's ex-fiance√©. \"Not unless you get an erection,\" he is told. The questions get asked, but obviously the film is at a loss for answers. And that's exactly the point. Or rather, the lack of it. Come on, *who cares* if this particular chap gets it on with a pretty girl? He already \"looks and acts straight\" anyway, and he's a carpenter to boot.\n\n\"Men's Lib\" has never been taken seriously, and clearly this movie was not going to be the first one to do so. In this case it's a particularly revolting New Age kind of men's group, so that's alright.\n\nOh well. At least James Purefoy looked the part."
