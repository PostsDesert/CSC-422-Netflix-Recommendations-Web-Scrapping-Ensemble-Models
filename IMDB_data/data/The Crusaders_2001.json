I have to admit that performances are not special,maybe above average but the nice battle scenes,the good unpredictable story and the sights of Israel, give you a nice impression for the movie. I recommend this movie or series,I think since Das Boot series, we have not seen such interesting tv production and especially european one. I give to this movie 8/10."
