        "reviewBody": "I actually went to my local \"art house\" movie theater to see \"Napoleon Dynamite.\" I walked out of that movie after the first 10 minutes and walked into the movie playing in the room next to it, which happened to be \"Intimate Strangers.\" I had no idea what this movie was about - in fact, had never heard of it but anything had to be better than \"Napoleon Dynamite.\" What a pleasant surprise. Even though I missed the very beginning of the film, I figured out that Anna had a reversal problem and was visiting the wrong professional. \n\nThis movie explores a relationship of the mind, only hinting at the sexual. How refreshing!\n\nThis movie was entrancing. I fell in love with all of the characters. Who could not fall in love with Anna? How many times has a stranger walked into your life and you've found yourself captivated? Once - maybe twice? Perhaps I can ask that question since I met my husband due to circumstances that allowed our paths to cross (and any change in the smallest decision would have meant we would never have met) and within three days, we were planning a wedding. That was 20 years ago.\n\nSo no wonder I love this movie!"
