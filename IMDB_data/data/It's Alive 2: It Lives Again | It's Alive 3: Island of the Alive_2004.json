        "reviewBody": "When you watch a movie like this, you pretty much know what you're in for. This felt like a hastily put-together cash grab on the back of the first movie, which I'm sure it was. It's also why the script isn't exactly coherent and probably why there aren't as many monster scenes as we'd like and too much drama to pad out the movie's hour and a half run time, but when the monster scenes come, they were entertaining enough for me.\n\nLike in the first movie, they keep the little monsters in shadow and mostly obscured or have scenes shot from their point of view, but I think that actually works to the benefit of this. You see enough of them not to feel completely cheated, but it would have been nice to have even more of them in this. Sure, a lot of it is laughably bad, but I wasn't expecting Oscar-winning effects here anyway and it's still done better than the schlocky movies of the 50s and 60s.\n\nI gotta say, Frederic Forrest turns in one of the worst performances I've ever seen and he's one of the leads. He overacts to the point of hysteria, except it made me groan and roll my eyes more than laugh. And I thought. John P. Ryan was bad! Wow. Thankfully, Kathleen Lloyd does a great job and helps make this feel slightly more believable. I swear it looked like she had to fight from cracking up trying to act opposite Forrest's over the top antics, though. Andrew Duggan did a good job of treating his role seriously, too. John Marley is a recognizable face and not a bad actor, but in this, he is. He phoned it in. I can't say I blame him.\n\nI'd say that overall this is about as good as the first one which isn't saying much, but not bad for the obvious cash grab sequel that it is.\n\nRecommended for B-movie fans who don't take things too seriously. For others, I would steer clear of these kinds of movies in general.",
