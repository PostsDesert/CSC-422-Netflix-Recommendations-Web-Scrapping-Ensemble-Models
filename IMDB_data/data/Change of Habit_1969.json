        "reviewBody": "A sad lament among fans of Elvis Presley is that his handlers (read: Col. Tom Parker) thought so little of him and his talents that they put him in piles of cinematic dung such as \"Paradise Hawaiian Style\" and turned down movies like \"A Star is Born\". If you've spent your life watching \"Girls Girls Girls\" and \"Kid Galahad\" then seeing a \"normal\" Elvis sans jumpsuit or guitar or a bevy of bikini-clad babes may jar you.\n\nHowever, \"Change of Habit\" is not one of his mindless musicals. It is instead an attempt at a \"real\" movie, and Elvis fares well. It is odd to see Mary Tyler Moore as his love interest, but it's odd to see her as anything but Laura Petrie to me anyway. A little better script, maybe a different actress as his foil, and \"Change of Habit\" would have been a better movie. But when you compare it to \"Clambake\" ....well.....that's not really fair is it?",
