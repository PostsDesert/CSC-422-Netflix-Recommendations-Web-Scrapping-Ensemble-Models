Rehashes of tired slo-mo shooting scenes, that are poor copies at that, and staged fights. Don't people realize that it's the film that shows something different and unique or weird that gets noticed? Seems like the filmmakers in Sacramento are still trying to ride the coattails of Blood, Guts, and Octane. A fluke of film that happened to hit at a time right when that whole indie Clerks/Pulp Fiction thing was big. But this is the to be expected, the outcome of mediocrity. I just hope one day people will wake up and see that.",
