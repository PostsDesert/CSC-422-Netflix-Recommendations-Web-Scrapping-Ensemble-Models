        "reviewBody": "I saw this movie as an American kid growing up in England in the early 1970's. It absolutely captivated me, as it did my 9 year old English schoolmates. The musical score still resonates to this day, as do the magnificent scenes of those twin Merlin powered Mosquitos. As a movie, its got its share of flaws, but as a piece of aviation memorabilia, let it live forever! Along with \"The Battle of Britain\", this movie will captivate audiences for generations to come who will wonder what it was like when a few brave airmen stood between barbarism and civilization. The movie may have its cheesy moments (like many WW2 flicks) but the emotions were real. A lot of those guys never came back from their missions. This film, quite simply, shows both the glory and the sacrifice of war. The De Havilland Mosquito was a remarkable aircraft, and this movie really is a tribute to all the men who designed, built, and flew it in combat."

        "description": "During World War II, Norwegian underground leader Erik Bergman informs the British of the location of a German V2 fuel manufacturing plant. Situated beneath an overhanging cliff at the end of an easily defended fjord, the factory can be destroyed only by collapsing the cliff on top of it, using light Mosquito aircraft. Wing Comdr. Roy Grant's 633 squadron is assigned the task, and Bergman plans a ground attack to coincide with the air strike, but he is captured and tortured by the Gestapo. Gestapo headquarters is destroyed by the 633 squadron, and Bergman is killed, but not before he reveals the plans for the attack. Underground resistance is destroyed, and Mosquito pilots, unaware that the ground attack will not take place, fly to the factory, and the entire squadron is wiped out. However, the last bomb dropped makes the mission a success. Only Grant and his navigator survive.",
