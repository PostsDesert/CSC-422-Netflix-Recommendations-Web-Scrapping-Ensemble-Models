A young talented martial artist comes from several victories with just one blow in a fighting tournament where everything is allowed. Then, he is selected by the event managers to fight a much taller and very arrogant adversary. Eventually, he will have a much worse challenge, in a deadly underground version of that tournament. In the end of the short TV film, there is the impression that it was just a TV episode, lacking a proper end.",
