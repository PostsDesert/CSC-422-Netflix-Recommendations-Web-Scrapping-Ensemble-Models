This movie is unashamedly stupid, but if you'll just relax it's also one of the funniest films you'll ever see.\n\nOk, it has a paper-thin plot, but it does contain some cinematic firsts: a moose breaking its way out of a classic car; Rob Lowe being electrocuted through his pecker; a fat man in a little coat.\n\nSee this film.
