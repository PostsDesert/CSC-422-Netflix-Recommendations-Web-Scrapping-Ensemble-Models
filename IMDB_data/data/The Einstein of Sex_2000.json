I spent my main college years during covid so I'm so so happy that I got to have a glimpse of what I feel like is the real actual college experience. The acting was awesome, writing excellent and I love love loveeeee all of the characters. Like literally all of them. Such a fun show, extremely relatable and great one to FaceTime your friends after and during and have that college experience life is taking from us right now. Just. Watch. It. It's awesome and I promise you won't be able to stop once you start. Mindy Kaling and everyone else involved killed it. It is ky new favorite show and I can't wait for next season.",
