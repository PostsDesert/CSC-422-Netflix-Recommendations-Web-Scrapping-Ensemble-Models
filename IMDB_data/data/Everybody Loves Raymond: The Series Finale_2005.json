There are some great clips from the shows nine seasons and the footage of the taping of the last episode shows what a family the cast became off stage as well as on it.\n\nThe only flaw as others have pointed out is that Doris Roberts is missing from the whole thing which seems strange when you consider what a huge part of the show she was and how many awards she won for her performance during its run. We never actually get a reason why she doesn't appear but her absence does reduce the quality of this film.\n\nI have to admit that the shot of Peter Boyle waving farewell is especially poignant now that the great man has passed away. He was also a great part of making this show the hit that it was. To see him looking so frail and waving farewell makes it feel like he is waving to you personally. \n\nFarewell to Raymond - we still love you.",
