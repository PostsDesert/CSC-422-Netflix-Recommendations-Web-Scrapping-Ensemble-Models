        "reviewBody": "I liked this movie very much.I just finished watching it tonight, but had seen half of it on TV before, so I got the DVD copy of it. I don't think Victoria Principal gets much credit for her acting and I hadn't seen her in a movie before and I was surprised how good she was in this movie. The movie is based on a true story and its hard to believe that such things can happen. Principal plays the part of Anna, the wife of a lawyer who won't believe what she tells him about someone else (can't give the plot away). I could identify with Anna's total frustration with her husband not believing her. It would drive me crazy too. Anna ends up having a breakdown and is forced into a psychiatric ward where she is treated badly and being there makes her more ill than when she first went in. Nicholas Campbell (Da Vinci's Inquest on Canadian TV) plays the part of the sympathetic and compassionate husband but in the beginning he is not supportive of his wife because he doesn't want to believe her. His acting is top rate and he is convincing. plays his part very well.\n\nRobert Vaughn and Kenneth Welsh also show some excellent acting. An under-rated movie. If you like this kind of movie, get it if you can.",
