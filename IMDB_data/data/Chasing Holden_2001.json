        "reviewBody": "This is an interesting movie, it's about a troubled young man whose father is a senator. Neil(played by Dj qualls-the new guy) goes on a journey to meet an author(J.D. Salinger) whom he feels has a strong hold on his life. He bring along for his journey a girl(T.J.) from school who he becomes quite attached to, her only wish in life is to see New York City what she falls in love with then begins to hate which pushes them further onto their journey.. as the movie goes on you find out why Neil is troubled, and that T.J. has an illness. This movie is not a PG rating do to the realisms in life (it hold some sexual content, and not so appropriate language). It IS a good movie, everything falls into place quite well and you truly get a feel for the characters. I liked it. some didn't but I thought it was really well done and I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
