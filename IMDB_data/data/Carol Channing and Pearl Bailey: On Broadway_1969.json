        "reviewBody": "Carol and Pearl are indeed two theatrical legends although Carol seems the more interesting performer, at least here. Pearl Bailey is at her best when she is mixing it up with her audience using her trademark off-handed remarks. But Carol has more interesting material by and large.\n\nThe gimmick, of course, is that both of them played Dolly Levi in \"Hello, Dolly!\" with Carol originating the part. (Would that she had done the part in the film version instead of a too-young Barbra Streisand who is mentioned at one point!) To my mind, the really pleasant surprises here are Channing's impersonation of Marlene Dietrich, then the \"failed\" silent screen star \"Cecilia Sisson\", and, less so, Carmen Miranda which is little more than a throwaway. These add to the sense of Carol's versatility and really make this video worth watching.\n\nThe \"extra\" on this DVD consists of a very brief bloopers excerpt.",
