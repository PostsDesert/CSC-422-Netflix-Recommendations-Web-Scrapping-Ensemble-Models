        "reviewBody": "The movie talks upon three soldiers , one Serbian and two Bosnian who are trapped in a trench amidst the contenders lines during Servia-Bosnia Herzegovina war in 1993 , at the time of the heaviest fighting between the two warring sides . One Bosnian finds himself unlucky hooked to a bomb that in movement case can cause blow-up . \n\nIt's a sour denounce facing the war realized with dark humor . There's a keen critic to the role of United Nations , ¨U.N.¨ , in which two soldiers from opposing sides in the conflict , become trapped in no man's land , whilst a third soldier becomes a living booby trap . The screenplay tackles issues about the war horror , morality and ethic but with notes of acute and sharp comedy developed in great sense of ductility and fairness . The story is nicely narrated in hight sensitivity and intelligence . It's a fascinating warlike film described in a serious-comic style . The flick obtained a well deserved Oscar winner for best foreign language picture . The film tries to remain neutral but appear Radovan Karazkic's images commanding the Sarajevo siege . The motion picture takes part of the Servian war subgenre , such as :¨Welcome to Sarajevo¨ or ¨Before the Rain¨ and other numerous films . The principal actors , although unknown , are excellent . The support cast is more known , thus shows up Katrin Aldridge who unfortunately dead recently by a stroke , she interprets an impulsive journalist . Simon Callow as an United Nations colonel is equally magnificent . The picture was finely directed by debuting Danis Tanovic (¨Tigers¨, \"An Episode in the Life of an Iron Picker\" , ¨Triage¨) who also wrote the screenplay and even the music . Rating : Above average . Well catching.",
