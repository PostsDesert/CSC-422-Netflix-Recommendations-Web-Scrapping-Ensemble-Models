Also the idea that this beautiful young man would be attracted to the much older Hershey's lifeless and weird character is just too far to stretch suspension of disbelief. Starts nowhere, and never engages any interest, or sympathy, beyond the unsatisfied hope that something might happen soon. The only bright spot is Naveen Andrews, cranky and withholding as his character is, at least he's interesting to watch and has an inner life and energy even when hampered by senseless dialogue."
