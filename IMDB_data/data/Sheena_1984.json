        "reviewBody": "I will admit this is not a masterpiece of cinema but as for jungle adventures go this is very good and entertaining. It moves along at a swift pace, lots of action plus a very likeable and sexy heroine. There is quite some nudity (but no sex) from Tanya Roberts ofcourse but also from the evil black princess. Director John Guillermin makes sure you get a good look at their (great) bodies.\n\n Guillermin is familiar with the topic because in the early sixties he made some excellent Tarzan movies starring Gordon Scott. In my mind he is also an undeserved neglected director who had his fair share of flops (\"Shaft in Afrika\",\"King Kong lives\",etc...)but who almost always succeeds in delivering an entertaining movie, not great art, but rousing actioners as \"The Blue Max\", \"Guns at Batasi\", \"The Bridge at Remagen\" or even the 1976 \"King Kong\". Whatever the topic, you won't get easily bored by a Guillermindirected movie. \n\nJust compare \"Sheena\" with other so-called jungle movies from the early eighties : \"Tarzan the Ape Man\" with Bo Derek, one the true worst movies of all time or the two abysmal Allan Quartermain movies starring Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone.\n\nSheena comes off quite nicely.\n\nI gave it 7/10."
