I thought it was better than the 1st but I can see from reading the other comments not many people agree with me, but that's OK. I'll just be alone in this one. What makes it for me is the teenagers. I love the kids in this movie. Amual makes me crack up every time I watch it and I think Lauryn Hill is fabulous! OK so the ending is very predictable but I think would have been disappointed if they hadn't won. Am I right?! I love watching the ending over and over, or when Amual hits that high note for their first concert. Anyways...I don't see how people don't love this movie, it's so fun and has such a great message! I'd much rather watch teenagers that I can relate to in the sequel than a bunch of old nuns in the 1st Sister Act but that's just me! Guess I'm alone here! \n\nOne thing I want to say though regardless of anything is that I think every school choir should show this movie! I'm in the choir at my school and unfortunately we have very little spirit and most people in it don't care very much. I'm going to recommend that we show this movie to my choir teacher. It may not help but it can't hurt. I recommend every choir see this one just to show that a choir can dance and have fun while singing. At least show the ending if nothing else! Ok there's my two cents! Everyone needs to see the movie at least for the music and to have a good time!\n\nI give this movie a 9.5/10!",
