It is one of the best stage versions that I have ever seen. A very interesting way to do it with minimalist props and scenery compared to the traditional \"dark stage and spotlight version\". I can not wait for it to be released on DVD, and since it is a Showtime Networks and PBS Masterpiece Theatre co-production, I know it is only a matter of time before it is released. This is one DVD that will have a prized position in my DVD collection.",
