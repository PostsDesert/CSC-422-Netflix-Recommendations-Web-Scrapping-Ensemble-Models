It was much better than the later \"Outlaw Years\" episodes. \"The Outlaw Years\" were good but I don't think they had the heart that \"The Series\" did. They were just more enjoyable and was very well acted. Watch both and see what you think, and although many will disagree with me, I think that \"The Series\" surpassed \"The Outlaw Years\" by a long shot."
