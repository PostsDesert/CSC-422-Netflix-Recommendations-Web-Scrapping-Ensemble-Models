        "reviewBody": "I always loved Winnie the Pooh. This is my favorite of all the Pooh movies. My favorite story is the first one, Winnie The Pooh and the Honey Tree, where Pooh eats too much honey and gets stuck in Rabbit's hole. It is such a heartwarming movie. I love most of the Disney movies that I saw, but this has to be one of my all time faves. My son, who is now 14 months old, is an absolute Winnie the Pooh nut. He goes nuts when the opening comes on (even though only Pooh's right arm and leg are seen). His favorite is also The Honey Tree story. Unfortunately, I dread the very last story, because he cries because the movie is over, and that means the end of the movie. He watches it so much, I have to have a second copy! If you have children, or even if you don't and you just plain love Disney (like me and my son), I highly recommend Pooh. It will really cheer you up when you are feeling bad, so I really recommend this movie (you won't be sorry you bought it!)."
