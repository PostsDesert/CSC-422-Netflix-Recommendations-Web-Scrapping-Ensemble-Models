        "name": "Not bad, but it feels like the cut version",
        "reviewBody": "The two-episode \"Miyuki-chan in Wonderland/Mirrorland\", with each episode clocking in at barely 13 mins each, is definitely too short to take on the breadth of Lewis Caroll's two novels \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" and \"Through the Looking-Glass\". But even so, within itself it seemed very rushed. Scenes felt truncated or edited, leaving me wondering if this is indeed a cut version (for what it's worth, I'm talking about the only version currently available on DVD, released by \"Section 23\" in 2002).\n\nIn just about every scene, just when things start to get interesting (as some character makes a humorous lesbian pass at her), Miyuki screams and runs away, and then we're on to the next scene. After a while you begin to see how unimaginative the story is despite the tremendous potential of Lewis Caroll's original source as well as this irreverent yet unique spoof.\n\nNot overt enough to be erotic, not subtle enough to be witty, not cohesive enough to be an engaging story, and with the same goofy song on infinite repeat throughout the whole 26 minute spectacle, \"Miyuki-chan in Wonderland\" suffers from being \"not enough\" on many levels. While the illustration will hold your attention (all beautiful women wearing some sort of fetish attire) and while a few corny gags are predictable but worth a laugh, such as the Dominatrix Queen saying she's going to punish the guilty party, prompting dozens of undersexed girls to shout \"Punish me! Punish me!\", this short animation will likely remain a curiosity rather than a cult classic.\n\nIncidentally, the entire animation can be found on YouTube, so don't waste your money on buying the (26 min) DVD like I did. Unless, like me, you're just a Wonderland fanatic who must own all versions of the tale, good or bad. I even had to buy Tom Petty's video collection for his Wonderland based video \"Don't Come Around Here No More\". Now where can I find that 1976 porn version I've heard about?"
