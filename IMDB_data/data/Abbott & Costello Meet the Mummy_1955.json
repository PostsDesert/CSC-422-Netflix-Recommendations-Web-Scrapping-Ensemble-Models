I was pleasantly surprised when I watched the first two episodes. The show was/is actually great.\n\nI love the characters.and want to strangle either Quinta Brunson or. Chris Perfetti every other minute. Both are like close friends of mine, one who can never leave things alone, they always want to poke sleeping bears; the other is so careful to never give any offense to anyone that they of course offend everyone.\n\nThe rest of the cast is just perfect, the disinterested principal, the disillusioned but still hard working veteran teacher, the NY gal who \"has a guy\" and the \"I'm just here for a short time\" sub. Yes the characters can be a little over the top in the stereo-types, but that is a tried and true formula for sit coms.\n\nThree episodes in and it is just getting better.",
