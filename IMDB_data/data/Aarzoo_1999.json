A fourth grader would write better lines. It had a typical Bollywood story. Some nice songs. Other than that, everything was amateur and not at the level of a blockbuster Bollywood movie. The protagonist's story was poorly developed. Action scenes were terrible except for Akshay Kumar's athleticism. 3.5/10",
