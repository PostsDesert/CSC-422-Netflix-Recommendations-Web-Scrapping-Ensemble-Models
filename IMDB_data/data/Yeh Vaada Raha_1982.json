I just have to say though, until this last time when I watched it, this movie was a really serious one for me, in the sense that I could find very little wrong with it. But I really have to share some funny parts with you. First when Vicky's mother's sari gets stuck in the car door, and second during the accident, dummies were obviously used, but if you watch the driver's side VERY carefully, you'll see the head fall off when the car hits the truck. haha. but otherwise, an EXCELLENT movie - you gotta see it!",
