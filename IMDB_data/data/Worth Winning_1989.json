Otherwise, this is a bog-standard TV sitcom, stretched out to and hour and a half. Mark Harmon is certainly attractive, but his role does not exactly bring out the best in him. Little interest, and no heat, is generated by the other two ladies. Stowe is pretty, but not sexy, while Holvoe does not offer much of anything here, apart from her fancy dresses. Joan Severance is gorgeous, on the other hand, but she only gets a walk-on part (apparently, she did not qualify for Holvoe's part because she's not a blonde).",
