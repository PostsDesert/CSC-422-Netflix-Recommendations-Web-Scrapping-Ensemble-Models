One of my favourite things is when I stumble across some little movie on TV that I haven't seen before. This happened to me one night when I was just skipping channels, as you do. \n\nWhat stopped me dead in my tracks was the sight of Elizabeth Shue. Now I freely admit that this woman just hypnotizes me. She's extremely appealing on several levels so I will often watch a movie that's an obvious turkey (The Saint, The Hollow Man) just because she is in it.\n\nElizabeth aside, the movie itself proved to have quite a diverting premise: the meltdown of society when some of the trappings are suddenly removed. There is a lot that could have been done with this, but the production was obviously not that well-financed, so the director smartly focused on the characters instead.\n\nIt really isn't as bad as many of the people here make it out to be. The three leads are interesting enough, there is a sub-plot in the form of a love triangle to keep things interesting and the concept is certainly relevant enough in today's times to hold one's attention.\n\nYes, OK, its not a classic but its not a complete disaster either. And I for one detest neat little endings tied up in a bow. \n\nUltimately, as with many films, its down to the circumstances in which it is viewed. If you're looking to be entertained for a couple of hours on a slow week night, you could do a lot worse.",
