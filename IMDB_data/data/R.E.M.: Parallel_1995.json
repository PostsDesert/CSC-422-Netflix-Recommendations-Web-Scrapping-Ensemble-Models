The video that deserves special mention, however, is Crush with Eyeliner. Directed by Spike Jonze -who later directed the brilliant movie Being John Malkovich- it simply has to be seen to be believed. The only thing that's missing are interviews. I would've loved some interviews. If you're a fan of REM, you will enjoy Parallel.",
