Someone said the music in this one was better than the others. I strongly disagree. The music has no substance rhythm or beat to it. Just sounded like alot of mumbling and people beating drumsticks together. At least 1-3 were funny and had at least myself laughing the whole time. I equate the 1st 3 movies to the Friday series now. House Party 4 cannot touch the first 3 or any of the Friday movies."
