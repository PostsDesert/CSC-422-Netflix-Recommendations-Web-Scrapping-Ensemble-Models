        "reviewBody": "I enjoy the Elvira movies, no doubt about that. But \"Elvira's Haunted Hills\" does suffer under the 'curse' of being a sequel - that's being it fails to fully live up to the level of its predecessor \"Elvira: Mistress of the Dark\".\n\nIt does still have the same kind of dark comedy with undertones of sexual nature and just straight downright silliness. But this is, of course, what is part of the Elvira universe and character, and it is what the fans like, that and her in-your-face big, well, you know... charm and wits.\n\nWhat puzzles me about the story in the 2001 movie \"Elvira's Haunted Hills\" is why it is set in 1851 Transylvania. Well, aside from the obvious B-movie reference to Dracula, of course, and for the Gothic backdrop, but other than that I didn't get it.\n\nStorywise, then \"Elvira's Haunted Hills\" falters a bit compared to the 1988 movie \"Elvira: Mistress of the Dark\", both in contents and in progression. That being said, don't get me wrong, it is not a bad story, far from it. It just wasn't at the same level of the first movie.\n\nCassandra Peterson performs as to be expected, I mean, she is Elvira in the flesh, after all. But also Richard O'Brien (playing Lord Vladimere Hellsubus) and Heather Hopper (playing Lady Roxanna Hellsubus) really performed quite well in this movie.\n\nThe comedy in \"Elvira's Haunted Hills\" was a bit more subtle than the comedy in the 1988 predecessor, which was a shame, because it made it a tad less enjoyable. The scene that had me laughing the most was one of the last scene with the sinking castle, it was just such a wonderful spoof of Titanic.\n\nAll in all \"Elvira's Haunted Hills\" is an enjoyable movie, and a movie that any fan of Elvira should have in their movie collection. And while not embodying the same Halloween atmosphere as the 1988 movie, \"Elvira's Haunted Hills\" is still worth putting into a Halloween movie marathon just for the sake of it being Elvira!",
