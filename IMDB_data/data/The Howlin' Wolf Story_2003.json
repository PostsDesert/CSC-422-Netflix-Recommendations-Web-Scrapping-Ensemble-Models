        "reviewBody": "This is the best blues documentary ever (not like those crappy TV series) and its a must for any music or rock fan, an invaluable piece of history (just take a look at those shots from Sam Lay's Camera back in the old glory days of Chicago Blues), any blues fan will love this film, and it is fun ennough to watch for any person... too bad that it is not very well known as it deserves (guess that why this film DOES GOT THE BLUES) The life of Chester Burnett (greatest bluesman ever!) is told tru the memories of those who ever work with him or share a stage with him (highlighs on one of the Chess brothers, Wolf's daughters, harpplayer bb arnold, and off course Mr Hubert Sumlin a real guitar god)we'll see some footage avaible before in other places but together for the first time with the above mentioned club footage...\n\nThis is a really well done documentary, the one blues fans were waiting for, i recommend also the Wolf's biography \"Moaning at Midnight\" recently published",
