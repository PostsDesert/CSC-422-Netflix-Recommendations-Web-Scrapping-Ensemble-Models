The actors all appear to be having fun making the movie and the crew also have high spirits (as can be seen in the behind the scenes feature); this contributes to a movie that can kick back and have fun. Sure, the story isn't of Memento caliber but it also isn't so tedious that it's unwatchable. Special props go to the Foley team who's sound effects are top notch! From the very first *BOING* I knew this would be an entertaining and lighthearted movie and I wasn't disappointed! If you're looking for a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, and you don't mind looking at a few (very nice) topless ladies, and you're in the mood to laugh out loud, you could do worse than watching \"The Girl Who Shagged Me\".",
