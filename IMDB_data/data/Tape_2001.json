        "reviewBody": "How could this flick get so many positive reviews? Encore gives it three stars and Roger Ebert 3 and a half out of four. I was expecting a taut dramatic piece with a fascinating plot. Ugh. Who cares what happened ten years ago at the end of high school? Whatever happened, the three characters must have somehow moved on, albeit in different directions. A drug dealer, a film maker and an assistant DA. Why rehash the past? I agree with Ken Spiker's review. \"Tape\" is pointless, boring and repetitive. It has trite dialogue and no true dramatic tension. Sum it up in two words: uninteresting drivel. Although \"Tape\" has little in common with William Shakespeare's well-crafted comedies and tragedies, it could aptly steal one of his titles: MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.",
