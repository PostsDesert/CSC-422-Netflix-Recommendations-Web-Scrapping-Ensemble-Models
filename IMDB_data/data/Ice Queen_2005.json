Bad acting, bad script, bad costume for the monster, etc. - all those are expected and they're what make a bad horror flick hilarious. And Ice Queen has them. But nothing happens in this movie for about the first hour, and then there's about twenty minutes of 'horror.' Okay, yes, there are some pretty ridiculous and hilarious moments - as when the monster gets momentarily taken out by a common bathroom fixture, or anytime the monster is shown just standing there going \"blaeh! blaeh!\" looking like she's about to go into convulsions - but overall it's not enough.",
