This documentary about big people who believe in invisible little people is actually quite sad, assuming said big people aren't simply looking for publicity. Walker, who admits to believing in 'something' himself, takes everything at face value, and doesn't bother consulting a single rational person in the course of his film. That undoubtedly was his intent, but this is essentially a puff piece for people who live in cloud cuckoo land. At least they all seem like thoroughly nice folk.",
