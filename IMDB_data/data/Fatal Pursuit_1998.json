The characters are completely unoriginal, acting is terrible and offers no belief in the story what so ever (also the actress doesn't keep her English accent for the whole movie, it seems to fade), the story is as bad as it gets and the scenes are just stupid. One of the first scenes it the movie shows people getting shot up. some guy somehow gets caught on fire and falls into death next to a parked limo. he is about a meter away and the limo explodes. this is the highpoint of the movie and it wasn't even good. I cannot believe that this was made in 1998. By the looks of this movie you would think it had to be a terrible movie from the early 80s.",
