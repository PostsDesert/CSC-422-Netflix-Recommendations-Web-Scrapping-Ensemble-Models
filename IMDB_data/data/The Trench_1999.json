        "reviewBody": "I went considerably out of my way to be the only woman in the theater to see \"The Trench\" from Britain, a conventional continuation of the British obsession with World War I as being the most symbolic war. Not much new here that wasn't in \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" or \"Paths of Glory\" or \"Gallipoli\", but I suppose some lessons need illustrating for new generations. \n\nTaking place claustrophobically in the trenches just prior to the bloody Battle of the Somme with the sounds of war all around--though it could also have been taking place in the canals of Mars against aliens-- the characters are typically class-based Brits (from ineffectual aristocratic officer to working class blokes whose conversations need subtitles for American viewers), but manage to stay above stereotypes through excellent acting (with actors familiar to us from PBS's \"Mystery\" and \"Masterpiece Theater\") and personalization.\n\nI'm probably the only one other than Daniel Craig's family (and the webmasters at his fan site) who went to see the movie for him, but his career soldier sergeant in particular is a real human being.\n\nOtherwise, as always with ensemble war movies, I have trouble telling the young guys in uniform apart to keep the characters straight.(originally written 12/2/2000)",
