The scenery is stunning throughout. The child actors actually seemed like nice kids unlike most child actors these days. Mark Harmon copes with changing personalities very well. The children are excellent. \n\nThe whole film though predictable from the start,made me smile and laugh. It's a good way to unwind at the end of the day. It was worth watching if only for the policewoman on the door step! And Orky of course, in his various forms!",
