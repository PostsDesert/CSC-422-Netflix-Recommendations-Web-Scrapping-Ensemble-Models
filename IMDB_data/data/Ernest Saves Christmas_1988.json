Having seen this film five times in the last five years, it is surely one that sicks with me. Some -- myself included -- will say \"Ernest Goes to Camp\" is among the best in the series, as is \"Ernest Scared Stupid\". But only one, \"Ernest Saves Christmas\", has the appeal to make it one to see every December (or late November).\n\nPerfect casting for Santa, some stupid humor. Some offbeat humor (the \"Santa's Slay\" but is awesome). A feel-good message. And what a breakthrough role for Noelle Parker, who went on to star as Amy Fisher and then have her own television series, \"Sisters\". I am surprised she not got any bigger than she is... would love to hear her on an audio commentary for this film.",
