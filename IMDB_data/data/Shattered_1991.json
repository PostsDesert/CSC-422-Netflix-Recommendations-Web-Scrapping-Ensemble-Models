The first time I saw this movie was in college, we watched it one night and it continued to be shown in our apartment almost non-stop for the next 4 days. People could not get enough of it.\n\nI won't go into the plot, etc. but will tell you it offers many twists and turns and will keep you interested and surprised at the end.\n\nYou cannot go wrong renting this movie!"
