        "reviewBody": "I found 'Seeta Aur Geeta' to be a thoroughly enjoyable flick. One can expect lots of laughter from this comedy. Even though in terms of story, this isn't much different from other dual role comedies but it still is a charming film. Ramesh Sippy is a good director (even though I find 'Sholay' overrated) as he sticks to the main story. The beautiful Hema Malini plays the title roles and she brilliantly pulls it off. Seeta is the boring, pushover, damsel in distress sister and Geeta is the street smart, bold, charming and mischievous one. It is the Hema Malini who plays Geeta that stands out. She proves her capability as a comedian and is a fun treat to watch. Sanjeev Kumar is excellent as the doctor who falls in love with Geeta (this actor can hardly do wrong in my books). It is his scenes with Malini that I enjoyed most. Dharmendra tends to overact, particularly as the drunk, but otherwise he is alright. I love all the songs though 'Maine Sharab Pee Hai' is the least favourite. My favourite ones are the two duets sung by Kishore Kumar and Asha Bhosle. Overall, 'Seeta Aur Geeta' is a charming comedy of errors. A classic indeed."
