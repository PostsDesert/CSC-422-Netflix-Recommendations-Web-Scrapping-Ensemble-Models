Lots of cool gadgets, the fighting is really good. Lots of humour in it, I laughed quite alot. If you gonna see this see it subbed and not dubbed. I have seen both versions and when I saw it subbed it was much funnier. I didn't really know so much about Tony Leung before this movie, but now I really like him. He was very very cool in this movie. See it now!\n\nRating 10/10 (can I give it a 11?)"
