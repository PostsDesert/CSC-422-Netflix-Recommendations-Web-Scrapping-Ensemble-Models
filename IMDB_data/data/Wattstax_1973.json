        "reviewBody": "I heard it straight from the source. I just had the privilege to see this film with Mel Stuart at the James River Film Festival in Richmond VA and he says it's coming to DVD in September 2004 with the original ending of the Isaac Hayes performance. Stuart said that it will also be aired on PBS in September 04 so look for that. This great documentary has life of the black experience as it was in the early 70's even has Richard Pryor giving some insight. Has some other good footage of Albert King, the Staple Singers, Rufus and Carla Thomas, Johnnie Taylor, Little Melvin, the Bar-Kays and Jesse Jackson. Some other interesting facts about the filming of the movie. Stuart specifically hired an all black film crew to capture the feel of this event by interviewing people in the streets and around the festival."
