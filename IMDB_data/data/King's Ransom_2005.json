It was just too short. The credits were rolling but I was wanting more.\n\nRemember, it is not true to life. It seems that \"black\" films are required to either represent true life or contain a \"do-good message\" for the youth.\n\nI'd prefer to go to a movie to laugh and be entertained. \n\nI thought this film was entertaining.\n\nKing's Ransom was funny but too short.\n\nI've seen it twice just to make sure.",
