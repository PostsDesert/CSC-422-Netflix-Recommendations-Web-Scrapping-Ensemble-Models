        "reviewBody": "A story that encapsulates where we as a race are heading for a very bad outcome indeed. As clearly stated in the film by Jeff Goldblum's character, \" when technology surpasses humanity\". We as a species are in severe danger and crisis over how we perceive what our lives are truly about. We are losing our humanity by advancements in our technology that serve only to relieve us of harnessing our one true purpose that makes us unique within our humanity........Choice. The film also shows that a pure and unique individual is not accepted within those who are already lost of their own humanity. I find myself relating to 'powder' in many ways, albeit minus his physical and other obvious electrical abilities. But I do understand his humanity and choice to make humane decisions that do affect all of us. And his feeling of isolation and not 'fitting in' to his fellow kind. Hopefully one day we can be at a point where our humanity will rise above our technological demands, otherwise we are on a roller-coaster ride to self destruction. Good film,good message.",
