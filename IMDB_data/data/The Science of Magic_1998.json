It was a wonderful experience to watch 2 people thrust together to find contentment, and then love. Keri Russell and Skeet Ulrich were wonderful as the newly married couple. The only downside to this film was the subplot involving the Japanese interment girls. It took away from the pace of the film. The rest of the supporting cast filled in nicely. There was indeed some magic in this film. Some may argue its to fake for their taste, but I loved the film. Overall it was a wonderful film. I give it 7.5 out of 10 stars! I can't wait till it comes out on DVD!"
