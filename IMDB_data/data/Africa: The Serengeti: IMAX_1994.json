        "reviewBody": "There are more than one element that makes this film a first rate movie going experience.The only actor assigned is James Earl Jones as Narrator.His gift of speech is excellent with a presentation that allows the viewer to participate in a wider,deeper plain than just the Serengeti,however it is indeed the Serengeti where all of time passes and we are blessed with an attempt to show life as everlasting,such is the contribution of the Narrator Voice and its place in the viewing of this very well made I-Max presentation.The visual aspect is not entirely subtle,it is more like, very up front with an important condition and that condition is in the telling of this very dramatic story.It is not so simple a thing to allow the reader to know what is actually required but as is pointed out in the narration there is no remorse when a predator(Cheetah) runs down a Gazelle(very young one)and provides for its own(of which there are only 1 left of 4 born to this Cheetah)It is very strong with an accent of survival merely by numbers and perhaps a little bit of luck.The fittest does not seem to fit as the wildebeest it is suggested was formed by committee from spare parts,A very intelligent presentation with much more to come.The migration of the large size herds is undaunted and though it is absolutely riveting it is murderous with these almost dumb like animals literally trampling each other to death.It is quite something to view as this event unfolds across the plains of the Serengeti.This migration if you will occurs every year with the onset of the rains in the North to the Southern extremes ,encompassing the Kenyan and Tanzanian plains .This is very much both excellent story telling and a documentary as well.The short history and timeless quality presented provide a survey that underpins the journey of the wildebeest and it is even a little bit much to take when it is suggested that herbivores eat grass and vegetation while carnivores eat herbivores.What is a bit much, there does not seem to be a element of fitness in there survival but of the sheer weight of numbers that allow for the species to survive. The predators seem only to choose there time for there chance as those same numbers go running by your front door by the thousands in this historical and timeless journey across the plains of Africa.This by itself will very much keep your attention,however it is not the only element that this film possesses which provide for a worthwhile movie going experience.There is both choral and vocal composition which accompany the film and may almost catch you off guard as to its place in the telling of the story,it is very good.This is a no holds barred idea of life and death that is presented in a timeless quality that can get to you with a wow.The best part and perhaps the reason why this film was seen by me was the I-Max format.It is in fact a WOW!The film opens and the plains of the Serengeti are almost below you as well as thousands of running Wildebeests.This film from the beginning is a credit to the storytelling ability that the I-Max format provides for,wide beautiful vistas stretching the limits of our movie going experience almost to witness a miracle (though we suggest it is nature)in the migration of the African wildebeest.This is a very good movie.It is worthwhile a purchase and even in a humbled presentation will stand if you will the test of time.I know I just viewed it on my computer.I have had the pleasure of attending a few I-Max shows and it would seem that not every presentation works as well as every other presentation.There was also the stories and that to seemed not always to work either,however there were exceptions and one which I compare with Africa:The Serengeti and that is T-Rex:Back To The Cretaceous.There are many ways to present a dramatic story and though Africa:The Serengeti is an example of one such way, T-Rex:Back To The Cretaceous tells a tale with mind you the same kind of unfolding history but it does it with subtlety and the development of a story within a story.It too, to me represents an all around presentation in the I-Max format that is worthy of this entertainment vehicle that we know as I-Max.Both films are excellent and both are very highly recommended.",
