        "reviewBody": "The only seductive element about this twaddle was the title which leads one to hope that the film might have some connection with the original.\n\nThe connection is there alright in the central character but that's about it. The plot line is pretty well unfathomable and the acting generally wooden. The decision to 'European-ise' the whole thing and import B-list English actors ( who have all been seen in much better things and really need to change their agents) is a disaster. Even a couple of bursts of gratuitous violence are badly done and every character in it lacks any form of credibility. The two female leads flash their stocking tops but still manage to generate no more than a fraction of the eroticism that Linda Fiorentino could have done in the original wearing a heavy overcoat and a ski hat. Suitable only for film students who really want to know what 'awful' really looks like."
