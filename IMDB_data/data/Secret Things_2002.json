        "reviewBody": "One of the best movies I've seen in a while. Not for the conservative minded or squeamish, from beginning to end there is little more than sex. But that's integral to the plot. This is a movie that showcases the violence and the decay that is just under the surface of respectable society. It's about two strong characters who begin down the road to a tragedy of their own making. It questions morality, it pushes the limits, it steps over 'that thin line', and it takes us over the line with it. It is human weakness, irrationality, and most of all, obsession, on film. \n\nThe acting, both in and out of the \"bedroom\" was excellent. It is sometimes hard to follow, especially with the subtitles, but that only makes watching it a second time more worth it. I've never seen it on sale or for rent in a store, but if you have an online DVD rental service, then you'll have no problem getting a hold of it.",
