        "reviewBody": "To save his beloved Deianira (Leonora Ruffo, the sexy starship captain in 'Star Pilot' (1966)), the mighty Hercules (a convincingly massive Reg Park) descends into a Hades to obtain a sacred stone. Directed by Mario Bava, the film has a colourful, surreal look that belies its low budget (similar to the director's sci-fi cult-fav 'Planet of the Vampires (1965)) and motors along at a brisk pace to a delirious finale involving flying daemons and a wicked vampire king (a dubbed and somewhat wasted Christopher Lee). As 60s Italian 'sword and sandal' epics go, this one is pretty good: Park makes a good bulky hero, Franco Giacobini doesn't overdo his goofy comic-relief shtick as Telemachus, and the vivid cinematography is striking, especially the colour-drenched Hell scenes. The special effects are surprisingly good at times (especially the 'distance' shots of characters crossing the sea of lava) although the wires holding up the 'flying' daemons at the end are painfully apparent. A fun, entertaining time-passer with memorable imagery.",
