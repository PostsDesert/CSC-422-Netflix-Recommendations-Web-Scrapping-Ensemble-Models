The Sydney Opera House and jokes about Wagner were good times amongst the usual good natured banter and crime solving, but I found myself missing Max and Freeway. The highlight was Jonathan and Jennifer coming back to the hotel in nothing but bathrobes and gift shop sunglasses...trying to look inconspicuous! Finally, the most adorable koala steals the show.",
