I really liked this event despite what some may think of it, i have always loved tournament format. Royce Gracie, Ken Shamrock, Patrick Smith, Kevin Rosier, Zane Frazier, Art Jimmerson, Teila Tuli, and the very interesting dutch fighter Gerard Gordeau all competed in the tournament. If you wanted to see how all started, i recommend you watch this. I don't want to spoil any of it so just watch it if you can. I don't know why you have to give a minimum of 10 lines on this site for a review, it's kind of annoying sometimes especially when i have to write this to fill up the spare room.",
