She meets a play boy who at first she teases and does not want to make love to which enfuriates him but as the film goes on the guy starts to have second thoughts and the tables are turned. While this film is engrossing , and maybe only for voyeuristic reasons ,it does have the problem that most French films do, which is far to much diologue. The acting is a plus point. 6 out of 10.",
