        "reviewBody": "This 1976 female bank robbers exploitation flick is extremely upbeat, with catchy tunes and wide open Texas vistas. Claudia Jennings is sex on wheels as the leader of a trio of bank robbers. Her partner in crime is Jocelyn Jones, and Johnny Crawford plays a \"professional hostage\". He also gets to share the \"bridal suite\" with Jennings and Jones. Not bad work for a marginal singer/television actor. It's also good to be the bellhop who delivers champagne to Jennings in the soaking tub. A trip to a fancy restaurant with a nude dancer (Alice Friedland) is memorable, and the isolated cabin shootout offers plenty of REALLY RED blood. The movie delivers, with ample bank robberies, ample explosions, and ample nudity. One final thought. You rarely see a Rolls Royce used as a getaway car. - MERK",
