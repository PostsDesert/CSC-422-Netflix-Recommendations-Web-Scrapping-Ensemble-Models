Eat My Dust is a hilarious action packed comedy that has to be seen to be believed. Roger Corman and Ron Howard have captured lightning in a bottle with this one. Charles B. Griffith had NEVER been given the credit he deserved. I have seen this film a few dozen times and it gets better with each viewing. Dave Grisman's score is unforgettable. Dave Madden is screamingly funny as \"big Bubba Jones\". Sh*t on a twisty stick EAT MY DUST is the perfect car action comedy of the 70s"
