I'd be thrilled to see Disney release a lot of their archival films. How about a DVD starring Jiminy Cricket? I can still hear Jiminy singing \"I'm No Fool\". \"Seabiscuit\" is riding a wave of current popularity, but I still remember Nautilus, Disney's \"The Horse With the Flying Tail\". A recent commercial on T.V. features rabbits multiplying out of control, but way back when there was a Disney short cartoon about multiplying guinea pigs. It would be great if future generations of children could savor and enjoy these little cinematic gems.",
