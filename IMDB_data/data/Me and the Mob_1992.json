Yes,it was painful because we were all that kid -- geek, awkward, nowhere with girls.\n\nThe movie is honest, funny, and I will see Olivia Cooke's unreal face in front of me for months. (And she did shave her head; I wondered about that.) R.J. Cyler gave perfect balance to the lead actor's awkward role.\n\nThe best thing about this movie is the writing; it crackles at times with insight into the outsider's life.\n\nI am much aggrieved that it only earned four million at the box office nationally. It's worth a lot more.",

But when Greg's mum insists he spends time with Rachel -- a girl in his class who has just been diagnosed with cancer -- Greg discovers just how powerful and important true friendship can be.",
