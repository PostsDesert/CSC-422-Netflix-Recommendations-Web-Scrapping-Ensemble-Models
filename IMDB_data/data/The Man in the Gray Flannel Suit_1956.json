Cobb, to offer a sincere portrait of a junior Madison Avenue exec who must choose between being a \"big CEO\" or a \"second-tier nine-to-fiver\".\n\nDirector/screenwriter Nunnaly Johnson guided the actors in uniformly well-modulated performances, all deeply felt and cleanly expressed. Keenan Wynn offered a surprisingly subtle and touching performance as well, in a film produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, with a Bernard Herrmann score.\n\nWhat a treat it is to watch these fine thespians breathe life into most intriguing characters from Sloan Wilson's thoughtful novel.",
