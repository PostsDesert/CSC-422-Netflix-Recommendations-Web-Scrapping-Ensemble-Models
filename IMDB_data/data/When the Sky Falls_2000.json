And indeed this feels like it should have been a 4-hour miniseries, not a 2-hour film. The subject matter is fascinating, the acting excellent and the themes raised very potent.\n\nProblem is, 'When The Sky Falls' can't seem to make up its mind whether it wants to be a straight thriller, a celebration of one woman's triumph or an examination of the aftermath (or continuation) of the Troubles in Ireland. Given a longer duration it could deal with all the matters effectively, not leave the viewer gasping for breath as he tries to unravel all the various elements of the complex plot. The film is also cursed with the kind of weak, rather dull ending often associated with 'true-life' movies; and the sickening violence seems somehow out of place in so serious a project.\n\nAll this aside, 'When The Sky Falls' is a gripping, intriguing piece of drama; it's just not half the film it could have been.",
