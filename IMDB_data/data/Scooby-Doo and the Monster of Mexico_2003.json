        "reviewBody": "Monster Of Mexico is one of the weaker Scooby Doo movies I've seen. I am not saying it is the worst, I am merely saying that this could have been so much better. On the plus side, the animation is not at all bad, and neither is the voice acting. There are some nice characters thrown into the mix. However, what didn't wow me as much, was the rather unimaginative plot, and the perpetrator I found rather obvious. Also I never was fond of the soundtrack either, at the end of the day, it felt rather monotonous for my liking. There were times when the mystery got very predictable, like when Louis claimed to have been hit on the head, and the gang suspected he was faking it, I was thinking now where have I heard that before? The dialogue wasn't particularly that inspiring either. I am not saying that Monster of Mexico was a terrible movie, it wasn't, it just didn't work for me that's all. If you want a great Scooby Doo movie, try Witch's Ghost, Goblin King or Zombie Island. And Pirates Ahoy! was fun too. 4/10 Bethany Cox",
