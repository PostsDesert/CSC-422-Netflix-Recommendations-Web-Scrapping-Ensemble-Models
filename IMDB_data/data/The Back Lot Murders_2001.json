On the info it said that he was a main character and that wasn't true he had maybe about 4 lines. I started watching the movie about 15 min in and maybe about ten later I knew who the killer was. This movie was ridiculous. It almost hurt to watch it. I mean whoever the main girl was Janey, I am SUPER surpised that she never did anything else after this movie. I mean her acting brought me to tears but not in the moving emotion sense but in the embarrassed for her to be on camera sense. This movie with the exception of the two leads the manager lady and the director and the 4 lines that Corey had there isn't a don't even have a word. Whoever was the casting director for this movie (no doubt a male) probaly is flipping burgers right now after casting everyone in that movie. Other than that I recommend it, if you are a corey haim fan."
