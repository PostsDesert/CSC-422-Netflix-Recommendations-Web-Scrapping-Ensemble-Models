The show received a very successful and very deserved nine year run.\n\nI have made errors in judging in the past about the quality of various shows, but of this I am certain. \"Touched By An Angel\" is my second favorite show of all time. (Second only to the beautiful, short-lived \"Once and Again\".)God has truly inspired everyone involved with this show. May God bless them all!"
