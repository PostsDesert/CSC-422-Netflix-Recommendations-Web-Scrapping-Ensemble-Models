But there is a remarkable chemistry between them and paricularly with the women in the story. Gallo is quite magnetic in the lead and has a wonderful rapport with both his girlfriend and an older hooker.\n\nForsythe can be over-the-top in many films, but here he settles down and adds a touching counterpoint to Gallo. I mostly credit director Taylor for this small treasure because he has shown the same kind of class in his Napoleon film, \"Emperor's New Clothes.\" Check out both of these films."
