        "reviewBody": "Home Alone 4, a made for TV sequel to Home Alone 1 and 2 (part 3 had a different story line) just doesn't make the cut. The casting for Kevin and his brother and sister were terrible. The kids look younger and even in the film Kevin states he is 9 years old, where in the first two he was older, however he remembers one of the burgulars from before. Marv, played by French Stuart this time around, has a new partner, Vera, who isn't any brighter than Marv. They decided to cancel the Harry character, originally played by Joe Pesci, even though they do reference him a few times. Now, Kevin's parents are about to finalize their divorce. His father lives in a huge smart house mansion with his girlfriend Natalie and Kevin stays over for Christmas. But Marv and Vera show up with a new plan - kidnapping. Home Alone 4 makes a failed attempt of returning to the Kevin McCallister storyline, but they were better off using new characters."
