        "reviewBody": "I don't know WHO the person is that compiles the sketches, but I was almost disappointed at the list on this DVD. Christopher Walken has done things that are FAR funnier than this. And, if they were going to put on \"The Boulevard of Broken Balls,\" couldn't they at least have found it in their hearts to leave out the \"census bureau\" sketch and put in Stalk Talk instead? The saving grace, the one EVERYONE wants, is the Blue Oyster Cult sketch. But really, that one should have been saved for the Will Ferrel disc. The \"special features\" could have been developed a little better as well. It was fascinating to see how the Continental episodes were filmed, but after about 5 minutes of that it gets pretty old. Yes, the cameraman walks around with a glove on. So what? Let's see some interviews! Throw on a couple of extra blooper moments! (Yes, we all know it's a live show, but every once in a while, someone cracks.) All in all, the SNL folks could have produced a better product for the amount of money they are charging folks like me and you to view it.\n\n===Heather \"I Got A Fever\" Amelia",
