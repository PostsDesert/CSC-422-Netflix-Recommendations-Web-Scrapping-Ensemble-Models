        "reviewBody": "Bob Williams is one of many unemployed in his area and faced with doing cash-in-hand work and odd jobs to keep his family's heads above water. Regardless of his and his wife's hardships they are both committed Catholics. His daughter is having her first communion and Bob wants her to fit in with the others  meaning a new dress and shoes which will total about £100. His attempts to raise the money mostly brings very small reward and frustration. Meanwhile his luck runs nothing but bad and his van is stolen  limiting his ability to pick up jobs and get around. As his debts rise, so do his troubles and his desperation.\n\nThe type of film that Ken Loach made his name directing, this film is a touching and natural ode to the spirit of the poor man. The plot is not so much a typical day in the life as a dramatic piece that follows the downward spiral of Bob as a representation of how life on the breadline is one challenge after another. In Bob's life an one-off expense of £100 is a major incident to be gotten through rather than the inconvenience that it is for the majority of us. The film does a very good job of portraying it  it isn't a film noir descent into crime but rather just the spirit of a man fighting to pay the bills. Most of us will have had this at some point but few of us can relate to those that get by daily on odd-jobs and going door-to-door; however the script here lays it out convincingly and naturally, easily allowing me to get into the lives before me. In this regard it is impacting because the humour and desperation of the people is convincing and their day-to-day situation dire.\n\nThe cast all take the material and run with it and there are few here that I didn't totally believe. Jones wears the character like a second skin and fits into it really well. His desperation is well complemented by Tomlinson who adds the comic spirit to the bottom classes. The rest of the cast are solid despite not having the limelight in the same way. Brown is good despite having the very occasional rare moment. Phoenix is sweet and natural and the rest of the cast feel mostly real. Loach's direction is grainy and fits the world his story is in.\n\nI hate to use the words over and over again but this is a convincing and natural story and it is touching and engaging as a result. It does a great job of capturing the spirit of the poor, making the best of what they have  but not ever ignoring the fact that Bob et al are the type of shifty people who you wouldn't want to mess with."
