        "reviewBody": "I revisited this for the first time in several years, and I really enjoyed it. It's got a stronger and different Charles Bronson performance in it as he plays a cop who's one of several targets on an insane woman's hit list as she seeks vengeance after getting out of jail. In addition to the good Bronson performance, I thought the female killer (Carrie Snodgress) was a welcome addition and was a fairly formidable villainess. The big problem in the film is the repetitive and childish \"potty-mouth\" name calling by the annoying Kathleen Wilhoite; it's not funny especially after a couple dozen times, nor are the names especially creative. She plays a young car thief who gets mixed up with Bronson and comes close to spoiling the movie; thankfully there is still enough action going on that I'm willing to ignore her and call this a good film of its type. *** out of ****",
