However, when I pop in this DVD, crank up the surround sound, and sit about 6 feet from my high-definition widescreen TV, it's damned close to being there! All this is balanced with a side story of restoring one of Andretti's original Indy racers, compete with his test driving it again after all those years. The background music is pleasant, and the picture is just reference quality. A nice DVD to own, to watch now and again, and to demo your surround sound system!"
