Although I haven't laughed as hard as I did on the very first prank of the first episode the show has remained fresh and original, and more importantly funny, in the last couple of episodes.\n\nI'm such a big fan of this show that I stopped taping The Simpsons so I could tape this instead. When I found myself with the difficult choice of which to tape I ultimately chose JKX - which is a big deal because I haven't purposely missed taping The Simpsons in about 8 years!\n\nI hope others are enjoying the show as much as I am. For those who haven't seen an episode yet - check it out! It truly is one of the funniest shows on TV!"
