Anyway, he did! And tell the truth the movie ain't that bad.\n\nIt is about the group of friends try to save their beautiful town from taking over by the rich tycoon.\n\nNot very original story but movie did offer more on pretty funny casting that turn out to be good (Caroline look great); some of the scenes are funny and smile worthy and even to laughable at time.\n\nRecommendation: Definitely worth a watch \n\nRating: 7/10 (Grade: C+)\n\nPlease Rate My Review After Reading (YES/No), Thanks!",
