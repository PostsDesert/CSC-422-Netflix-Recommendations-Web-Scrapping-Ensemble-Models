        "reviewBody": "Let me start by saying that Friends and Family is not a \"great\" film, or anything like it. But it is a very entertaining film, with lots of good jokes (usually in the 6-8 range on a scale of 1-10 for jokes) and it has another terrific performance by the amazing Tovah Feldshuh (she also gave one of the great -- and unacknowledged -- performances of the year in 2001 in \"Dating Jessica Stein\"). She seems to be a blessing for gay themed movies, but I'd really love to see her in lots of other stuff.\n\n Someone else's review mentioned something about the jokes being insidery gay. Don't be misled by that comment. I think everyone will get the Judy Garland and Elizabeth Taylor references, etc. I mean, at this point, is there anyone under the age of 60 who doesn't understand camp humor? I don't think so.\n\nOnly arguable problem -- the gay couple is a little too \"sterile.\" Sure they look good together and they have the same bedroom, but I don't think we get to see a kiss or even handholding. So from a Gay P.C. point of view it's a little too \"Will & Grace.\" \n\nAnyway, it's fun, it's broad, there are some good-looking guys but it's very PG (BRING THE KIDS!!!) the time flies by and you leave the theatre happy. All that for $6-11 (depending on what part of the country you live in.) What a bargain!",
