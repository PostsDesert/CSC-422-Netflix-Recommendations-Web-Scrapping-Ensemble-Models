Too bad he has a son and will likely marry the mother but anyway...\n\nWhile not in the mainstream... it was a very intriguing movie. I wasn't sure what to expect but I'm pleased with what I got... though I had trouble watching some love scenes. :o)\n\nI thought there was something wrong with me that it was left open ended... but I'm glad I wasn't the only person left scratching their head."
