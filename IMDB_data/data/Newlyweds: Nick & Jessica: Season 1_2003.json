I do think Jessica would have wanted a bit more affection than her husband showed. I really felt for her when she had to watch her husband dancing with other girls (it must be hard for any woman) and I don't feel Nick was very reassuring. The funniest bit was the episode where they were playing a game with a group of friends and one of them thought African was a language and Nick pointed out that Africa was a country, but the people don't speak African!! Very funny. Interestingly, Jess seems to buy things without looking at price tags, and then complain about it later. Like the time she bought lingerie for $628! I'm such a romantic and I keep thinking they'll end up together again."
