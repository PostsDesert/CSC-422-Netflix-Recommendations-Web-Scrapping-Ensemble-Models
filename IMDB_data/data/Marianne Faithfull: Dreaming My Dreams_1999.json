        "reviewBody": "A nice rundown of Marianne's unique (to say the least!) life: her journey to stardom, her fall into addiction, and her long trek out of the muck, only to re-invent herself as a raspy voiced punk chanteuse. There's plenty of entertaining stuff here, and lots of Rolling Stones dirt (she was Mick's girlfriend) for all you baby boomers. As a bonus, there's a live set she did for Session at West 54th, which gives a good overview of some of her best songs.\n\nOverall- this is an excellent introduction to the complex Ms. Faithful, and provides a wealth of knowledge (and Marianne's dryly humorous anecdotes) for fans and covers plenty of ground her autobiography does not.\n\nHighly Recommended!",
