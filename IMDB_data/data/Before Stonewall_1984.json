Just found out last year, from a German website, about the film's \"all gay\" reputation.\n\nHe died 50+ yrs ago, so no way to find out real scoop now.\n\nI purchased a Video of the short version - apparently all that remains - of the film and have have had some good laughs showing it to friends. The costumes are great and the whole thing very much before it's time. Hope to find out more about it's history.\n\nOur dad's brother (Gino Corrado) was also in the movies, and is credited with something 272 appearances from 1916 to the 1970's. Remember seeing him in \"B\" movies on TV as a kid."
