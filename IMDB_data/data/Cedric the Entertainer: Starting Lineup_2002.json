Interested to see some more, I picked this one at random. \n\nIt's okay, nothing particularly interesting. Sometimes it's just a show, only another stop in a tour, nothing more to say. But how about we say something more just for the heck of it? How about we say that sometimes the performer is so inspired, he sets the place on fire? How about sometimes the audience is so fiery and loving it, it seduces fire out of the man? And in other, rare times it's some strange confluence of cosmic gear where the world outside aligns with inside to bring us to a night that acquires significance?\n\nIf you had to guess, would you expect anything extraordinary from a show staged in a boxing ring in a casino hotel?"
