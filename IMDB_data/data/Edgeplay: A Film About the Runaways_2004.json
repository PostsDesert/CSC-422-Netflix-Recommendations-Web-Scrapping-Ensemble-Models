There are only two concert segments -- both feature covers: Velvet Underground's 'Rock n Roll' and Troggs' 'Wild Thing'. The incidental music backing the interview segments sounds like something out of \"Twin Peaks.\" Perhaps this type of score was selected to enhance the seedy backstory of these girls who were eaten alive and spit out by an unmerciful music industry.\n\nThis film is really for fans only. Anyone who doesn't know the backstory of the Runaways might end up confused or bored. But for true Runaways-maniacs, the interviews are quite revealing.",
