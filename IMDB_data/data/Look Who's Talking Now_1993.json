James and Mollie Ubriacco (John Travolta and Kirstie Alley) now have 2 more bundles of joy...dogs! Danny DeVito lends his talent as the voice of Rocks, a street dog who now belongs to Mikey. Diane Keaton is the voice of Daphne, a poodle that's dropped off by James's boss, Samantha (Lysette Anthony) who's got her sights on stealing James from Mollie. This is a great movie that is really enjoyable for everyone in the family."
