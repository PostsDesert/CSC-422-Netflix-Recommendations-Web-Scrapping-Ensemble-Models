        "reviewBody": "There have been harsh words about this \"unforgettable\",probably exaggerated.This could be some kind of update of \"spellbound\"(1945) and it recalls sometimes\" D.O.A. \"with Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan (1988) ,and even \"Jennifer eight\"(1992)with Andy Garcia (the latter for the murderer's identity).Except for Hitchcock's classic,of course , the movies I mention had disastrous reviews.And however,they have much more imaginative scripts than ,say,\"die hard\" (one,two or three,take your pick,they are interchangeable)\n\nScript for \"unforgettable\" is more polished than it has been given credit for.It's stunning when,in the end,the two stories come together,this time recalling \"dead again\" (K.Brannagh ,1991),another movie with an unfairly mediocre reputation;only 2 stars and a half on the Maltin!OK ,the plot for \"unforgettable\" is far-fetched,but it has an intern logic,and anyway,is it less credible than B.Willis singlehandedly taming a whole bunch of terrorists ?(Die Hard is rated 3 stars!)\n\nRay Liotta is an actor whose parts are not always worthy of himself.He's convincing here:during the whole movie,his face remains sad,wistful,as if he were waging an almost lost war.He rarely smiles,except when he's with his daughters.Linda Fiorentino,once she's provided Liotta with her drug,is not very important for the action (definitely not Ingrid Bergman in \"spellbound\").And we will be very thankful to Dahl for sparing us the umpteenth love affair between the patient and his doctor.More,we have here a very original ending,marred by the syrupy eponymous song though.It might be a happy end,after all,and which justifies the title.\n\nAll in all,it's an entertaining movie,mixing smartly sci-fi,thriller,and whodunit.It could become a sleeper."
