As you are actually seeing the different layers of the human body in action.\n\nThe plot as it goes from the birth of a baby girl and then taking you as she grows up till the death of her, made this documentary very very interesting. Also full of scientific information.\n\nI have also to state that this will appear somewhat naive for medical students and professionals. I use some of the shots in this documentary to illustrate some points and make somethings clear to my students.\n\nfinally, I would recommend this documentary to anyone who is interested in the human body and want to see a new original approach to the story of human life on the anatomical and physiological level.",
