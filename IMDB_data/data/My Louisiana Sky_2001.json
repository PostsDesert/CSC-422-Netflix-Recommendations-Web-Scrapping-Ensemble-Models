After winning two Awards for her work in this film (a Daytime Emmy and a Young Artist Award), I hope she continues to find work in films and ages with grace and maturity on-screen. Juliette Lewis and Shirley Knight provide able support, but the fact that the entire film is shown from Tiger Ann's point of view only provides Keel with some magnificent characterization and plenty of screentime that should have earned her star billing. Magnificent coming of age story that should be seen by audience members of all ages that suffers from being shown on ShowTime and seeing a less than adequate home video release.",
