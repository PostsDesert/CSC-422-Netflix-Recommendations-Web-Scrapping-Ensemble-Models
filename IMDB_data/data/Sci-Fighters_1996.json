When I bought this movie (for 3.99) I thought \"this movie will probably blow\", but what the heck, I haven't seen roddy in a flick since \"They Live\" or \"Hell Comes to Frog Town\" This one was awesome. I couldn't believe people railed it so. Notice how some of these morons say stupid, idiotic things like.........\"Oh, the cinematography was horrible\" What? who the hell cares, When I'm kicking back with my bass guitar practicing at night with some \"Trees\" I enjoy watching flicks, been doing this for 10 years so I know an entertaining movie when I see one and this one had me very very entertained. The acting was above average, really and the story line wasn't that hard to understand. Those who mention Logic in their review need some logic.....Logic like \"It's a movie Genius\". I enjoyed this movie even though people state some very stupid claims. watch it with an open mind and enjoy yourself great late at night when your solo."
