        "reviewBody": "Brooklyn Babylon is Marc Levin's 2001 film about the African American and Jewish community in Brooklyn, N.Y. Set in Crown Heights, the story revolves around Sara, a young Jewish girl and Solomon, an African American aspiring to become a musician. After their cars collide in a sudden car accident, Sara and Solomon lock eyes and develop an instant connection. After their second encounter, the two begin to see each other and its not soon before long until their friends and family disapprove. Eventually violence between their friends ensues and it seems that the more these two fall in love, the harder it is to maintain their budding romance. Gradually, Solomon exposes Sara to a whole new world outside of her Jewish faith which forces her to question her beliefs. Over all, Brooklyn Babylon is a pretty solid movie. Although the film is somewhat cliché, it is still easy to watch. Instead of violence, the film could've had a break through with less violence and more camaraderie between the characters. Marc Levin highlights the cultural backgrounds of the characters in a very profound way. In addition, the acting of the two leads is fairly decent. Watch out for some good musical performances by the roots.",
