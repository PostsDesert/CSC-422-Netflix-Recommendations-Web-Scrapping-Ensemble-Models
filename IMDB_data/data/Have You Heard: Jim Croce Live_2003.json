        "reviewBody": "Jim Croce, a singer from the early 1970s, had a bunch of hit songs (eight) in a short span (two years) and then died tragically in an accident. He was only 30 years old.\n\nIn this television-for-BBC concert, released on DVD about five years ago, Jim performs many of his great songs. In addition to footage of this made-for-TV concert, we also see him performing in other televised appearances, mostly, I think, from the U.S.A. Wherever the setting, this disc gives you a very nice, intimate look at this talented man. It's hard to believe these were done over 30 years ago, and that he's been gone that long.\n\nWhat you get is mainly a pleasant, small atmosphere with the artist and another guitarist singing a bunch of Croce's songs and Jim casually discussing some things about his career. He has a pleasing way of telling stories and had a very popular way of singing very interesting and sometimes very humorous songs. Those songs sound just as good today as they did 35 years ago.\n\nFor a sincere, loving tribute to a wonderful artist and just plain nice guy, this is highly recommended.",
