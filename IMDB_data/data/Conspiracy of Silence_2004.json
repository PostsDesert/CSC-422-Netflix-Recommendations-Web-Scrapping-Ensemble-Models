        "reviewBody": "Conspiracy of Silence is a 56-minute unreleased documentary film produced by Yorkshire Television for the Discovery Channel in 1993.\n\nIt documents a rather disturbing child trafficking ring involving politicians abusing children from orphanages such as Boystown.\n\nThis is heavy stuff involving powerful people, so I'll say these are all allegations. The court thought so- they gave victim Alisha Owens 9 years in prison for \"perjury\" when she tried to report her (alleged) abusers.\n\nIn light of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal this documentary is more important than ever.\n\nThe film was canceled at the last second, allegedly by politicians who reimbursed Discovery Channel for their expenses, yet one (slightly unfinished) copy was leaked.\n\nDirector Tim Tate was interviewed recently on private investigator Ed Opperman's podcast. Pretty horrifying material. Witnesses fled the state when questioned or died suddenly. C'est la vie, I suppose.\n\nSenator John Decamp write a book about it titled The Franklin Coverup.",
