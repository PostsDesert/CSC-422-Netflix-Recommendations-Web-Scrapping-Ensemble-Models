        "reviewBody": "I first saw (most) of this movie whilst enduring a rainy night in a lonely hotel in Shimoda (Japan). It was running on the local TV and whilst I couldn't understand any dialogue (no English) I very much enjoyed the interesting animation and what story I could work out. Since then I've obtained a Region-1 DVD and seen it with subtitles: it still entertains. As with a lot of Japanese output (Studio Ghibli in particular) the story is rooted in characterisation. I cared about the people in this movie and they seemed well fleshed out, they were never just a prop to hang events on. Basically: if you like Miyazaki then you'll probably like this.",
