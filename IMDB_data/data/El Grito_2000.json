        "reviewBody": "\"El grito\" is a good Mexican thriller movie, with an interesting script that tells the story of a young woman on the trail of a serial killer. The script focuses on themes such as machismo and feminism, in addition to the Catholic religion and Aztec mythology that goes to syncretism. The filming locations and cinematography come together beautifully to provide a remarkable atmosphere that follows the neo-noir and giallo subgenres, with several moments reminiscent of Argento's works. The soundtrack is good and works perfectly in the peak scene. The cast is outstanding, led by Yareli Arizmendi and Olivia Hussey, in addition to being accompanied by Steven Bauer, Angélica Aragón, Pedro Armendáriz Jr., Mario Iván Martínez, Juan Manuel Bernal, and the special participation of renowned actresses such as Blanca Sánchez and Sylvia Pasquel, all of them performing high-level performances. An excellently made film.",
