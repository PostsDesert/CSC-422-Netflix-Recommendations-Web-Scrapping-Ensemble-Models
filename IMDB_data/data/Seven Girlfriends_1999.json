        "reviewBody": "This movie made me feel good. It is not a masterpiece but still it has an over all quality as entertainment that runs the risk to be overseen. It deals with the most common angst of true love. Love problems have an impact on our daily life. This movie deals with many of the problems but in a shallow, American, Hollywood style. So what? The acting is on a basic level as the directing butÂ… I never had a feeling that any one in the movie was in lack of genuine acting skills. They did a fine job and there is a lot more to give from all of the main actors. This movie is an example of easy to digest motion picture art form as entertainment suitable for any one to take part of.",
