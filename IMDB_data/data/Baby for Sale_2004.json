The movie dragged on a little too long and was extremely boring, but the story itself was interesting. It's very enlightening to know that this movies is based from true facts. To think babies are being sold in America today is a harsh thing to acknowledge. I do appreciate what's trying to be shown from this film, but it was done very poorly.",
