        "reviewBody": "I've just finished watching \"It's Black Entertainment\" on cable TV in Australia and I'm surprised that there aren't more comments on IMDb considering that this brilliant documentary was made in 2002. Has it not been widely distributed? The format is fairly conventional, on \"That's Entertainment\" lines with a presenter (the beautiful Vanessa Williams sitting in the stalls), talking heads and film clips but it's the content that's the thing.\n\nBeginning with the great Sammy Davis who could sing, dance, act, and do impersonations (not fair, is it?) we are treated to a marvelous parade of talent from Bessie Smith through Louis Armstrong, Paul Robeson, Aretha Franklin and so,so many others up to today's (well 2002's) Hip-hoppers.\n\nOf course I'd like to have seen more of just about everybody, especially Fats Waller â€“ \"supreme master of stride piano\", the gorgeous Lena Horne and Dorothy Dandridge, and on and on I could go but I hope you get the idea.\n\nI'd like the commentators identified as even the credits weren't very helpful, the IMDb listings are much more comprehensive. No problem picking out Little Richard with his \"Look at me\" squeals but that's a very minor quibble. Please see \"It's Black Entertainment\" as soon as you get the chance.",
