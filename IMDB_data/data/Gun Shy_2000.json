Now after seeing it I'm glad I eventually picked it up. It's just fun, nothing more nothing less and not pretending to be more than that. Fun characters, actors obviously had a whole lot of fun making the movie, fun story and twists. If you dig some humor even at times subtle take a look at this one. Don't understand all the negative reviews. Belief me I've seen very very much worse comedy's."
