It's real enough that it reminds me deeply of the life that I have been lucky enough to get out of but regret that so many people still live there. Well done to all. But what is the purpose? What do we walk away with? The movie is good enough to make me wonder and worry about such questions. Hope lots other see it and have similar thoughts."
