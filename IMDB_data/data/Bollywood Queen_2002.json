        "reviewBody": "This movie is directed towards a very specific fan base but also has an appeal to normal movie watchers. If you understand Indian culture and in particular the UK version, you will love this film. It will definitely appear to be a dopey film to someone who doesn't understand the cultural context, but if you get it, then you'll definitely GET IT.\n\nThe movie has somewhat of a predictable ending in that it is a typical bollywood movie. But, I think this movie actually incorporates some satire in that it overdoes the typical bollywood stuff in a 'Matrix' kind of way. \n\nThe movie is still very much boy meets girl, girl's parents don't approve, boy spirals for awhile, girl's big brother plays the over protective role, and in the end the parents get fussy until everyone dances and ends up happy.",
