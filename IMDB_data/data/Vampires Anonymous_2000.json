It would have achieved this if it had taken the route it looked like it was going in the first 15 minutes, made up of dark and morbid humor, but it wound up to be like a teen flick. There were musical montages with the worst of the worst Ska music and it just bugged me. It also got to be extremely repetitive at times, and really began working off the same jokes. The movie did have points of a good atmosphere, I did like the darker parts, like the first fifteen minutes and the scene where he kills the b****rds from the bar, but the rest is just annoying, generic, and full of crappy ska music."
