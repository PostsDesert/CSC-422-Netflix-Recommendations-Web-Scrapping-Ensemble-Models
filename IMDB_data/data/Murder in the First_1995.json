A truly emotional movie that ranks among the top Alcatraz movies made! Gary Oldman also puts in a very solid performance. Christian Slater plays a youthful, inexperienced attorney to perfection.\n\nIn showing another side of Alcatraz the movie breaks away from typical escaped based Alcatraz films. While \"Escape from Alcatraz\" may still be the top movie in this topic area, \"Murder in the First\" provides a new twist that involves a different type of drama. Kevin Bacon was surely jilted for not being nominated here!",
