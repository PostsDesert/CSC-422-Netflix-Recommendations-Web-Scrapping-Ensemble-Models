Ann Blyth is wonderful and very beautiful as the little barmaid he falls in love with. I don't think it could have been better cast. Purdom perfectly lipsinks Mario Lanza's singing, and you are so consumed by the beautiful love story and the chemistry between Ann Blyth and Edmund Purdom, that you truly believe that it is Purdom singing. Even to this day when I hear the soundtract, I envision Purdom singing. I am a great Lanza fan and I am not one bit disappointed in this film without him. I do not believe that had Lanza done this movie it would have been as good as it is. Purdom, Lanza and Ann Blyth are all at their best in the wonderful musical."
