I.e. it is completely against the traditional aesthetics of American style movies where action, fantasy, humor, over-acting, special effects and the goal of getting as much dollars and viewers as possible are usually the main message there is... So, no wonder that some of the reviewers of this movie here, don't seem to have got at all what this movie is about...\n\nNothing special happens in the movie, but in the end you feel that you've seen something worth seeing, and even learned something new about human life and social relations.\n\nThe acting is good and realistic. The life stories told are nothing but happenings of ordinary life, but the director makes them into beautiful lyric poems that touch your heart.\n\nThe beautiful scenery shown alone makes this film worth watching. 9-10/10",
