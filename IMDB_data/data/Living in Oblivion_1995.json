Ultimate tribute to all independent filmmakers.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the director of this film learned the trade under the wing of Jim Jarmusch. The film has a very Jarmusch quality to it, and if it had his name on it I would not have been surprised. Especially the black and white scenes. We also get some great guest stars -- Steve Buscemi, obviously, but also Catherine Keener and Peter Dinklage.\n\nNot everyone will like this movie. It is a movie for those who make movies, and for those who love the making of movies. Especially independent films with little or no budget.",
