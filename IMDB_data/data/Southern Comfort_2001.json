This documentary was very beautiful, yet very horrific because the treatments Robert received was horrific! Can you imagine being turned down by 2 dozen Doctors because of how you identify?! The movie / documentary touched me on so many levels. You care for the people, you care for what they are going through, By the end of the documentary/movie, it hits you these are REAL PEOPL AFFECTED! Not characters playing a role, that this actually happend to them!",
