        "reviewBody": "This is an all around fun, fluffy, surprisingly tame movie. The title is a wee misleading, as there is mostly talk, and not much actual sex in it. (fortunately) This movie is tame enough for most teens and young adults. The humour is derived from the experiences of two very different single girls and what happens to their lives after an eventful summer vacation. Free-spirited Stacy (Lea Thompson) and her timid best friend Melissa (Victoria Jackson) each know the unique joys of casual sex \"This is kind of embarrassing to admit, but I remember when it was actually fun to say, \"Wow, that really felt great! What's your name again?\". But when Stacy starts reading stories about the growing fear of AIDS, she ponders the loose way in which she has governed her sex-life. She and Melissa pack up and head to an exclusive health resort where they start exploring the idea of settling down with the perfect Mr. Right.\n\nWhile Lea Thompson, Victoria Jackson & crew are excellent, Andrew Dice Clay steals this movie hands down! I have not been a fan of his. In fact I have never seen any of his shows, but he was marvelous in this movie. Based on the book by Wendy Goldman and Judy Toll, \"Casual Sex?\" is one of those classic 80's comedies where everyone seems to remember the movie poster, but not the film itself. That's a real shame, because the film still offers valuable opinions and ideas about dating and sex in a world where those activities hold very real dangers. That said, the movie is still hilariously funny, with Thompson and Jackson both incredibly talented actresses who totally engage the audience with their thoughtful performances.\n\nOverall rating: 7 out of 10.",
