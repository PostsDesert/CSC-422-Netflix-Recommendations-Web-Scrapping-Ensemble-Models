We see Bill Clinton, Governor of Arkansas at the time, looking back into the camera, at the audience, with a baseball cap on his head, and a t-shirt covering his body. About to sit down to have his cereal for breakfast, Clinton is talking casual on the phone to a friend. Like the opening conversation, the War Room is as unique and clever as any political documentary before or after. Most of the world did not known who James Carville was until 1992 / 1993. Most know him as a fast talking, cocky, and brilliant political player. Here, we see a deeper human being with more than just an objective, but a message to America. Behind his tears, we see the truth behind the Clinton Campaign in 1991. Whether you are a fan of politics or don't have the stomach to digest politics, you will enjoy the War Room.",
