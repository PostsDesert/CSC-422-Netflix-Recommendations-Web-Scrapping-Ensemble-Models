        "reviewBody": "Although its pretty well shot and comes across with very high production values, Gordon Chan's X-files inspired, yet very confused late 90's film, is a slow-burning mess that seems to be lost in itself and lacks the excitement his previous hits, as well as many Hong Kong film starring Lau and Wong!\n\nBasically the main story is of a conflicted and grieving scientist (Lau), who does battle with a cult aiming to destroy the earth... Sounds fun, but ultimately, the film is a mish-mash of sci-fi, mystery, romance, religion and some flat comedy moments.\n\nWhile the main cast do a good job with what they have, but there is much better out there from all involved. Armageddon does aim to differ from its Hong Kong counterparts, and it most certainly succeeds, perhaps just a little too much for fans of the genre. The little action there is, is provided by Bruce Law but its nothing to get too excited about...\n\nOverall: Watch if you're looking for something a little different, but I won't be giving it a second go!",
