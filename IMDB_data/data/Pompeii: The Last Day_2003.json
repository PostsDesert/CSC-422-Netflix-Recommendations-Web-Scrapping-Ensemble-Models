        "reviewBody": "I've seen several documentaries about Pompeii and Herculaneum but this one is by far the best. It is of exceptional quality throughout and I just can't imagine making a better film to discuss the horror when Mount Vesuvius erupted.\n\nWhat makes this film so interesting and well made is that it combines both live action recreations of the lives of many of the victims and greatly humanizes the tragedy. This makes this film so good--these aren't just special effects or caricatures but actual real people whose lives have been recreated by archaeologists who have examined their remains (such as the slave girl who tried, in vain, to protect the child in her charge). Now this alone might have been moving but also is only half the story. In addition, current views of the buildings and casts of victims bring to bear the full story--showing the the contrast between then and now. \n\nDespite the film making the stories so sad, it also was done in a very respectful and non-sensational manner--complete with beautifully somber and appropriate music. Perfect and well done in every way--a must for everyone to see.\n\nBy the way, this BBC production was shown on US television and was highly edited and material was added. I have seen both and prefer the original British version--though both are worth while.",
