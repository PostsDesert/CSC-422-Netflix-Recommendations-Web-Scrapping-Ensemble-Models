Just like people always make it to be like I Want To Break Free was Mercury's 'coming-out song'.\n\nHe didn't even write it, it was bass guitarist John Deacon.\n\nAlso the idea of dressing like women wasn't his. It was drummer Roger Taylor who came up with it. It was meant as a parody on the British soap Coronation Street.\n\nBut people will see want they want to see: a group of men dressed in drag singing about being gay. And to think this false assumption supposedly ruined it for the band in the US, smh...\n\nBut about the DVD:n it's excellent. i recommend it to every Queen-fan!"
