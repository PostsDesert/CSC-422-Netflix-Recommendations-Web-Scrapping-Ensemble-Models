The opening scene is a wonderful introduction for this truly excellent film. \n\n My favorite of the Muppet movies, this has excellent songs, some truly funny running gags and one-liners (and some that are absolute \"groaners\", but they're still deserving of a chuckle.), and a fun group of Muppets and celebrity cameos. Jim Henson is, and always will be, the definitive voice of Kermit. The film itself is very gentle in tone without getting too syrupy, and truly entertains all the way through.\n\nWith all of the \"quality\" children's programming that comes out these days, I can't help but wonder why more \"family\" films aren't actually made for the entire family like this film was. This is a real keeper, although it seems a little hard to find at times in the stores.",
