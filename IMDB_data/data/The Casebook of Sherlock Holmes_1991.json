In the case of 'The Eligible Bachelor', I felt that for the only time in the whole overall series, the creators stumbled, since I felt it was bloated and tedious, with unwise changes to the story.\n\nFortunately, I did like the other two expanded adaptations, and the regular episodes were equally superb, so I can't complain there, I just wish that for \"Casebook\", the producers remembered the old saying \"If it isn't broke, don't fix it!\" The team of Brett & Hardwicke are still superb though, which is to be expected.",
