There is such creepy dark humor within the script that you laugh as you cringe. A crusty tale of backwoods cannibals, how can that be anything but entertaining? As if the sisters weren't bad enough, when the boy enters the picture we are treated to yet another level of twisted heredity. Fred Meyers as Sanders is probably the most disgusting personification of \"The Bad Teen\" I have ever seen. Those zits!\n\nThomas Kempton's last line is the perfect end to the numerous horror flicks we have all seen. Why won't they just die?!"
