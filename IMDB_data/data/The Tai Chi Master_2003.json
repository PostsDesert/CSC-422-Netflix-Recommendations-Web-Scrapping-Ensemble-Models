This does not apply unfortunately to this movie. The Tai Chi Master is simply unwatchable. Not the plot, which is par for a Kung-Fu-Film, but the technical aspects are simply rotten.\n\nThe movie looks like it was filmed with a camcorder, and the lighting equipment appears as though it was bought at sears. If this was a student film from a 20 year old attending community college, I would give it an A. But its not a student film, its a professional production. Which is simply sad.\n\nThe movie appears to be a parody, but its not. Very sad indeed.",
