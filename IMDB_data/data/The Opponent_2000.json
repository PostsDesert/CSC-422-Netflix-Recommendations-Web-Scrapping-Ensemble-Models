        "reviewBody": "In this low budget action film Erika Eleniak, still gorgeous as ever, takes up boxing to release her emotions she has because she has a very possessive boyfriend who has got some loose hands. The film has an urban feeling which is good but we've already seen in it in Sly's Rocky franchise before. Especially training montages of Erika running through the streets in he gray jogging outfit makes you wonder if this isn't really Rocky VI released under a different name. The movie is a drama film, so there's more about relationships between people than boxing-matches (Erika only boxes in the ring twice) The one thing you keep waiting for is an eventual showdown between her and her abusive ex-boyfriend which just never happens. A miss in my eyes. The acting is good considering the lead is an ex-playmate and baywatch-star. The movie entertains and never gets dull. The movie isn't really originality itself but if you stumble upon it in a discount-bin in your local DVD-shop or come across it on TV, give it a chance. You might like it. And even if the story doesn't appeal to you: watching Erika Eleniak for 90 minutes can hardly be called \"torment\"\n\nI rate it a 6",
