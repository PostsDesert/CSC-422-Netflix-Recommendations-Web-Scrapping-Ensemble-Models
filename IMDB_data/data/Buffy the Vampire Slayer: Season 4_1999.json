I didn't fancy all of the story lines, but overall i really enjoyed it. I enjoyed it so much that i had to buy it on both blu-ray and DVD.I found this enjoyable to watch and i recommend it to anyone who loves buffy the vampire slayer. I never read any of the comics, but after watching this it made me want to read the buffy and angel comics so badly.",
