        "reviewBody": "In the latest incarnation of the popular series three rebellious students Shane, Tori, and Dustin are the last ones remaining at their ninja academy after the evil alien Lothor attacks the Earth. With mankind on the brink of destruction, the fate of the world lies in the hands of these unlikely heroes. Their ninja master teaches them to harness ancient mystical energies that transform them into Power Rangers Ninja Storm. Shane becomes the Red Wind Ranger, Tori becomes the blue wind ranger and Dustin becomes the yellow wind ranger. in addition to Lothor the rangers have to deal with Hunter and Blake the crimson and navy thunder rangers. this is a great show but it can be a little corney at times like it's previous predecessors noting the hollow acting of Wild Force (keeping in mind that I very much enjoyed the series since I was young watching the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers series) and the goofy storylines of In Space and The lost galaxy. Fans of the series including myself wait for the day when all teams of rangers, Mighty Morphin through Ninja storm unite and stop a threat that no one team can face."
