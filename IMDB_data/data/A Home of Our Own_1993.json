        "reviewBody": "This is a heart wrenching tale about a single mom trying her best to provide for her family. Kathy Bates is outstanding in her portrayal of a hard scrabble mom, down on her luck, who tries to start over and provide a home for her kids. I can't say enough about her performance.\n\nThis family goes through some really difficult times, so this isn't necessarily a feel good movie, although there are some inspiring moments. Just when you think things can't get any worse for this family, it does. My heart just broke.\n\nI think this movie does a great job if it causes us to take better notice of those around us who are in need - and do what we can to help them. It becomes difficult, if you run into a women like portrayed here, that is too proud to accept \"handouts\". But this movie is also inspiring in that it is a great example of the determination of the human spirit and what someone can do in this country if they make up their mind to be somebody and provide a better life for their children.",
