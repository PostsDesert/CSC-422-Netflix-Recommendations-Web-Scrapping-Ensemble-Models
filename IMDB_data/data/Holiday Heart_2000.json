        "reviewBody": "Caught this movie on the Black Entertainment Network while\n\nflipping channels. It was a pleasant surprise!!! Entertaining! Funny\n\nand heart tugging all at once.\n\nWhen a young girl cries for help for her mom who is being beaten\n\nup by her boyfriend, the only one to help is a drag queen--Holiday\n\nHeart-- who packs a punch. He befriends the duo taking them to\n\nhis home and they become a family in spite of their differences.\n\nAll is well until another man comes along putting a rift between the\n\nmother and Holiday. Then Drugs pull the mom away from the\n\nfamily.\n\nI found Holiday;s need for a family heartbreaking and truthful--and\n\nit was an incredible portrayal. Also great are Alfre Woodward and\n\nthe young girl.\n\nThere are a couple of holes in the plot but this story of a drag\n\nqueen with a heart of gold really packs an emotional wallop. What\n\na sleeper. Highly recommended",
