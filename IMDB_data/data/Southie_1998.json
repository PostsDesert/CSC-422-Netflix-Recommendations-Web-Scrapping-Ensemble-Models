When I got it home my wife asked me who Donnie was and I realized my mistake. However, I was very pleased with my mistake. This was a very good movie. A real family, good vs. bad and even small time mob interests. No nudity for those interested in that sort of thing.\n\nRose McGowen's acting was very good. Also, she looks gorgeous even when she's made up to look like a white trash alcoholic. The characters' accents do sometimes slip in and out with the exception of Donnie who is from Boston in real life.\n\nAll in all, it was a very good movie."
