        "reviewBody": "If you ever wanted to see a bunch of talent-free 70's porno actors and actresses in non-porno (OK, make that softcore porno) roles, well here's your chance. If you ever wanted to see a movie with more male frontal nudity than female, it's your lucky day. And if you haven't stopped reading yet,it's an Australian movie to boot (despite the plethora of American porn \"actors\"). This is actually the Australian portmanteau sequel to an equally stupid Australian portmanteau movie \"Fantasm\". The only real difference is that the wrap-around story this time involves two sex advice columnists pouring over various letters (the male Australian actor looks just like, but isn't, John Vernon, and the female Australian actress never takes off her clothes even though she is far more attractive than most of the American porno types that do). The rest of the movie, like \"Fantasm\", is a bunch of vignettes that are not funny, not entertaining, and fall uncomfortably between softcore and hardcore porn (with lots of flaccid male frontal nudity).\n\nThere isn't a lot to recommend in this movie I'm afraid. If you actually have a fondness for 70's porn and porn stars and want to see people like Bill Margold in non-porno action, you might enjoy it. The mammoth-mammaried Uschi Digardt does appear again for more sapphic frolicking, but she was in a lot better movies than this. Ditto with Cheryl \"Rainbeaux\" Smith who appears in a very politically incorrect vignette about a prudish girl who gets raped by a slob in a van at the drive-in and ends up enjoying it. Sad to say her brief appearance is the highlight of the movie and it alone makes this a slight improvement over \"Fantasm\". But if you're not a Smith or Digart fan, this isn't much more than a curio from the long-gone polyester decade."
