People prefer to live a lie than admit the truth, very reminiscent of today's world. The characters are talking to us, we are the jury.\n\nThe performances are amazing, nothing acting is so good, blows away today's competition.\n\nThe film score is stunning as well, one of my favourites from a Japanese film.\n\nThe direction is breathtaking, the jungle is beautifully lit, it has a sense of horror to it. Black and white was the perfect choice.\n\nOverall, an amazing film from a genius!"
