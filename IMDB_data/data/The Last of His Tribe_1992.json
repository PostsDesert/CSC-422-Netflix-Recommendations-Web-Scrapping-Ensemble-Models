I found it interesting how the anthropologist he befriended became so familiar with his Native language so soon! I think he wasn't like any other white anthropologist who wasn't interested in truly getting to know the people whose cultures he was studying. He really had a genuine liking for Ishi and as a result their friendship became very deep.\n\nWell........ anyways........... that's the reason why I gave this film a 6 out of 10.",
