        "reviewBody": "James Baldwin's wanderjahr about the journey from the rural south to New York City hits the big screen, with a fine cast and subtle story. Is there actually anything going on except for people living their lives as best as they can? It's only when it's all over and you think about it that it makes sense as a tale. This is is contrast to a lot of blockbusters that seem fine until you get home, take off your shoes, go to the refrigerator and open a beer, and then it hits you: it was all nonsense.\n\nA great cast helps, and here's one with Paul Winfield, Olivia Cole, Rosalind Cash, Giancarlo Esposito, Ruby Dee, Alfre Woodard... well, there are more, they're all good, and they have some telling characters to inhabit. It's not an easy movie to watch, because, as I said, there's no simple plot line, but it is tremendously rewarding if you take the trouble.",
