It is well acted (Jodie Foster is INCREDIBLE), as is Natasha Richardson and Liam Neeson, and it's just an all around GOOD movie. I recommend it very highly, and stopped short of giving it a \"10\" because it didn't have one of those neat what-happened-to-her title-over endings, though the ending IS a good one.",
