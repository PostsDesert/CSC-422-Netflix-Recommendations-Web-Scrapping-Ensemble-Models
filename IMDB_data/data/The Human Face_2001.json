John Cleese's presentation as well as the appearances by familiar actors and actresses alone make it worth watching, but the topic itself just happens to be very interesting: the complexities of the human face, and the way we respond to faces mentally, make for a fascinating bit of viewing.\n\nJohn Cleese doesn't seem to have gotten the credit he deserves in some of the other reviews here. He is not just a celebrity who knows nothing about the topic he is presenting--he in fact conceived and wrote \"The Human Face.\"\n\nIn short, \"The Human Face\" is both comical and scholarly and definitely worth watching if you have an opportunity."
