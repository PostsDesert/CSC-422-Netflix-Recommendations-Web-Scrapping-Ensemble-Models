        "reviewBody": "A decent enough film missing some key story and dramatic elements. The film takes no time getting into the meat of the matter, but the characters suffer because of it, ergo the film carries those same burdens.\n\nWere given the background of the four characters in question, but budgetary considerations scale down what could've been an epic western with its characteristic sale's point being fully explored. Regrettably it's somewhat clich√© both in terms of a western and female oriented film. Because of this the film strives for an A+ but winds up hitting moderate B territory.\n\nA well shot pic with respectable acting, but not enough expose on the characters' origins, nor on how they developed into the outlaw clique they create for the film.\n\nMinor quibble; it's been over thirty years since I picked up a weapon of any-kind, but seeing the four leads handle their weapons shows the director wasn't too concerned about \"girlish\" overtones intruding on a traditionally masculine venue. It's a minor point, but an important one because Nimrods of both sexes understand how to handle firearms, and it puts a wry grin on this viewer's face to see the lead characters intimidated by their own weapons (even though they get off spectacular hip shots, a la the tradition of many other westerns).\n\nActing and cinematography are respectable, as is the directing for what the shooting schedule allowed. Not an extraordinary film, but one that entertains on one level. That and the sexual component really didn't need the exposure it received in this film. In other words it could've been handled more tastefully, or axed altogether. Whoever thought seeing Barrymoore in a compromising position was way off base.\n\nI bought the thing at K-Mart for seven dollars, and given what I saw I think I got my money's worth. But what turned out to be a minor savings could have been a really bargain had FOX just allowed full development of script and story for this film."
