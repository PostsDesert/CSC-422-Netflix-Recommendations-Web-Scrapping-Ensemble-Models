I feel like I can't believe I've actually seen it -- waking up dizzy at 2 PM today on a Saturday and pondering this movie.\n\nAll I remember is the wonderful music, the great one-liners, and those fanciful legs. Oh, for legs such as those!\n\nEveryone must be forced to sit through this film as punishment for watching any television, ever.\n\nIsabella Rossilini should be so proud of forging through the offers of banal roles and accepting roles such as this. It is not a surprise that the same actresss who allowed David Lynch to strip and bruise her in Blue Velvet would embrace such a role as Port-Huntley. If you're sad, and like beer, she's your woman!\n\nThe audience last night was howling with laughter and delight at the absurd and brilliant lines in this movie. There was so much to like about this spectacular musical.\n\nBut most of all, there were those intoxicating legs.",
