        "reviewBody": "I had heard a few of their songs on oldie stations but was not really familiar with them. I did not know about their 10 year breakup. I do like concert films and happened to see this in my video rental store. After viewing, I immediately purchased it.\n\nThe concert of course features the harmony and guitars of the Everly's with a band that includes an electric keyboard and guitar and bass. The concert is basic as far as lighting and camera coverage. The brothers were not especially dynamic performers but honor their roots and their hit songs extremely well.\n\nI believe nearly all of their major hits are represented, some as parts of medleys and others slightly updated with different arrangements. This is a very satisfying concert and quite touching as the brothers sing some love songs that the listener can't help but feel that they are being sung to one another.\n\nPhil has passed away so there will be no more from this duo. Consider at least renting this for an entertaining musical experience.\n\nThere is a nice documentary as well which includes interviews with admirers and artists influential in their musical development.",
