        "reviewBody": "This movie does an excellent job of combining Shakespearian dialogue with\n\nmodern imagery. Admittedly, I first watched this movie when it came out\n\nbecause of Leo; eight years later (and seven years after middle school ended), I realize just how well-done this film actually is. Luhrmann did an excellent job of making the movie believable while using the quaint language. This movie\n\nbrings new life into the words of Shakespeare, and even if you know the play\n\nalmost by heart it is refreshing to hear the words in an entirely new context, and one which makes sense. This version of Romeo and Juliet actually does add\n\nsomething to the extensive history of the play. The soundtrack is excellent, the acting is appropriate (Danes and DiCaprio do a wonderful job of portraying the young lovers), and the scenery is fabulous. This film jump-started the trend of modern-day Shakespeare remakes, and I think it's the best one."
