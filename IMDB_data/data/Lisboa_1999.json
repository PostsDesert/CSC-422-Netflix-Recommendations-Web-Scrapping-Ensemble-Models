I gave a chance to the story and SURPRISE!!It was good.There are a lot of confused situations and excellent performances of the two characters. Shows how the latin culture has develope doing kinds of comedy with a strange sense of humor that is funny. If you haven't seen it yeat go and watch.But don't expect much of the ending is too disapointement.7 out of 10",
