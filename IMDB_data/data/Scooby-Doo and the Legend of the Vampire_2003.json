        "reviewBody": "I wasn't sure if taking the gang out of their usual locale of haunted mansions and creepy amusement parks and sending them to Australia was a good idea. While it is still a cool movie it would have worked just as well in Death Valley than in the Outback.\n\nThe villain this time is a Vampire called Yahoo-Yahweh, a bit of stupid name. It never sounds right when the characters say it. That minor quibble aside it's another solid entry in the recent Scooby Made For TV feature-length mysteries. Frank Welker (who's birthday it is today, coincidentally) is back as Fred and Scooby and Kasey Kasem is back as Shaggy (tho Scott Innes was perfect in the previous instalments and it puzzles why he didn't do Scooby's voice in the movie). It feels like a slickly animated version of the original show. Especially considering how Warner have decked the characters in their original clothes after fans objected to the modern clothes in the previous efforts. I have no opinion on this matter.\n\n It was cool to see the Hex Girls return and the music this time has a slightly hipper, more techno feel and lacks the orchestral fantasy of Louis Febre's scores for Alien Invaders and Cyber Chase. It's a shame there's no soundtrack CD for this one. I'd definitely buy it.\n\nThe extras consist of a childish game and a commentary by Shaggy, Scooby and Fred. Which should be fun. The DVD is presented in bright and colorful 1.33:1 full frame (as drawn) with an above average Dolby 5.1 soundtrack.",
