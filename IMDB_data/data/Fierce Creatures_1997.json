        "reviewBody": "It seemed that after the legendary Monty Python films and TV series, the brilliant Fawlty Towers and the hilarious A Fish Called Wanda, writer-actor John Cleese couldn't go wrong. But this is incredibly bad.\n\nYou can feel the desperation in this movie, hopelessly trying to latch on to Wanda's popularity and brilliance. The ending had to be reshot several times until test audiences approved. Cleese even included some references to Wanda and the Dead Parrot Sketch, as if to say \"I know this is bad but I wrote Python and AFCW, so please forgive me.\"\n\nThe plot concerns some half-baked idea about a zoo being taken over by a money-for-the-sake-of-money Rupert Murdoch/Kerry Packer-type magnate, who sends his idiot son and an ambitious female manager to set things right in the zoo. The jokes are old and cheap, more like a Carry-On film than Python/Fawlty. Rather than laughing, it pained me to see such a talented cast as Cleese, Palin, Kline, Curtis and Aitken wasted in undeveloped roles as they waddle through this puerile, unfunny and badly written film.\n\nHow can people say this is better than Fish Called Wanda? There aren't any of those outrageously hilarious scenes like Wanda hiding in Archie's lounge room while Otto tries to cover up for her, K-k-ken assassinating the old lady's dogs or getting chips shoved up his nose, the scenes of complete confusion in court, etc. I think the box office takings speak for themselves: Wanda - US$150 million, Fierce Creatures - US$20 million.\n\nI tried watching this film a second time, to see if it gets better, it didn't. It got worse. Whatever you do, forget this piece of trash and watch something by Monty Python or A Fish Called Wanda, which is John Cleese at his absolute writing and acting best."
