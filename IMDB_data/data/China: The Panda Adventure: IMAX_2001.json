        "reviewBody": "So I watched an IMAX film. These films have a surprisingly low budget. Not only that, but are surprisingly short by film standards. They could pass for individual one hour programs without a flinch.\n\nThis one centers on a widow who travels to China to save pandas. She races against a man that propagates the error that pandas are dangerous. Seemingly he also has something to do with her husbands untimely death. And, of course, she wins near the end.\n\nThere are a couple of scenes where it was obviously filmed in front of a green screen. But its IMAX, they can get away with that. Plus I learned slightly! Yay! Overall, its average. Its bad acting is overlapped by a short script and descent plot. \"C\"",
