        "reviewBody": "Anurag Basu's 'Saaya' is almost a scene by scene ripoff of 'Dragonfly'. Basu has since gained recognition as a hack director. However, this time, even after being ripped off, 'Saaya' is mind numbingly boring. It's pretty much about a man grieving his wife's death and Basu has cast one of the worst actors in this role. Abraham, though less wooden than he usually is, delivers yet another weak performance. His forced and yet clueless puppy-dog wannabe expressions are quite funny (unintentionally of course). Tara Sharma is miscast. Mahima Chaudhry is wasted in a less significant role but she is a scene stealer and acts better than the rest of the cast put together. Needless to say, she's the only one that acts at all. The song in the opening sequence has catchy lyrics while the rest of them are forgettable. The cinematography is sometimes very good but otherwise dull. Anyway, 'Saaya' is quite a waste and I'd only recommend it if you're having a hard time getting some sleep."
