Edward Norton does a bang-up job of a debut film, keeping things light, entertaining, and very, very funny-- and it's great to see him lighten up after such fare as \"Fight Club.\" A uniformly great cast, a witty, literate script, three scintillating lead performances, and a talented young director add easily up to the best romantic comedy since Woody Allen's \"Everyone Says I Love You\". Take your friends, take a date, take your grandma-- this is one everybody will enjoy, and you'll definitely come out smiling."
