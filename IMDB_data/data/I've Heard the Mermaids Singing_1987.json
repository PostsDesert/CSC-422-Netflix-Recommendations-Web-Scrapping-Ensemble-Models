She creates something truly original that has not been matched in a female comedic performance since.\n\nDirection is crisp, unexpected and magical. One can see why it was given a standing ovation at Cannes.\n\nIt is one of the few films that can me on a pure emotional level..appealing to the misunderstood individual.\n\nAnyone who has felt like they don't fit in will love this movie. Be sure to watch the closing credits to the end.\n\nNow On DVD with Rozema's commentary.",
