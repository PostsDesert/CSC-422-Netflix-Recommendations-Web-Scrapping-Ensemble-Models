Co-starring Eddie \"I'm an action transvestite\" Izzard this was a long time coming to the US. I have no idea if it ever got a theatrical release, but I'm sure it it did it lost money. this isn't to say the movie is bad, its not really, its just too run of the mill, guys in dresses aside. What can I say this is a situation ripe with comedy that doesn't really hit enough comedic moments. To be sure the action is fine and the film making is good, the problem is its so by the numbers that I could wander in and out while it was on and not feel I was missing something. Its like Matt LeBlanc's character who almost completes every mission he's on, its almost a good movie, thats almost funny. Put downs aside its worth a look if you like World War 2 movies, especially ones that are more than a bit off beat (even while remaining completely run of the mill). That should confuse you completely.",
