        "reviewBody": "There is no other film quite like \"Petey Wheatstraw\". My friends and I love cheesy, weird little cult films and we've seen almost ALL of them in almost every genre - the black urban films that were churned out during the 1970's have some classics and some clunkers and Rudy Ray Moore is a fascinating movie \"star\". A nightclub comic who was famous forhis filthy \"poems\" - we had enjoyed his other films \"Dolemite\" and \"Disco Godfather\" but nothing prepared us for \"Petey Wheatstraw\" - from the absurd plotline to the garish costumes, the cheap sets, the great music, the bad acting and the awful, laughable fight scenes, this movie has everything!!! You just have to sit back with a beer, a drink, whatever floats your boat and take this thing on. You never can guess what oddity or strange turn of events are around the corner. Rudy Ray Moore, with his out of shape nightclub comic's body, struts around like he's the sexiest thing in the world and the street worn looking women in the film fling themselves at him. His \"kung-fu\" fighting has to be seen to be believed - my 95 year old grandpa could lift his leg higher!!",
