Finally did it and I do undestand the fuss about it.\n\nNot a flick for everybody that I can tell because a lot of talking is done but it's the talking that starts to get funny after a while. In fact, a bunch of loser trying to solve a abduction and trying to hold the money for themselves goes terribly wrong.\n\nAfter a while you even want the talking to go on and on. And some art flick here and there it was indeed a hell of a ride, funny, stupid but genious in its kind.\n\nGore 0/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 3/5 Story 4/5 comedy 2/5.",
