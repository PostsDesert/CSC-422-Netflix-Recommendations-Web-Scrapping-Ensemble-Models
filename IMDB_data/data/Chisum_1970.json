        "reviewBody": "In the town of Lincoln, John Chisum (John Wayne) battles rustlers stealing his horses. He is concerned that greedy baron Lawrence Murphy is taking over as he buys up everything and pushing out the smaller operations. Murphy has even chosen the lawmen. Chisum and his men with honest rancher Tunstall, Pat Garrett, William Bonney aka Billy the Kid and others are forced to battle Murphy in his crocked schemes. Chisum opens his own bank and store to compete.\n\nIt's a simplistic old fashion western. Chisum is the best of the good. It's not all necessary. For example, it's not really necessary for Chisum to stand up for the Indians. It becomes a bit clunky. Billy the Kid needs to be played by a more charismatic actor than Geoffrey Deuel. McSween is too idealistic bordering on idiocy. This is a movie of sharp black and white. The cattle stampede is quite impressive and there is plenty of good action. The sensibility is old fashion even in its times.",
