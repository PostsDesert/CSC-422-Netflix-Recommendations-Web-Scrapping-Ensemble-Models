While some of the color footage of Hitler has been seen before (the footage from Hitler's home movies) the rest of the footage has not been seen. It is amazing to see this footage in bright color. While the series only three parts, and not enough time to go through the entire War in depth, there apparently are hundreds of more hours of footage left on the cutting room floor, and one can only hope that there will be future shows.\n\nThis documentary is available on DVD and VHS.",
