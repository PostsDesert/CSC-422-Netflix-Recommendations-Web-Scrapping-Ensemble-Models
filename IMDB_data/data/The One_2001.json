        "reviewBody": "Given the interesting idea behind the story, 'The One' could have been an entertaining flick. However, the contrived script, lack of character development and poor execution are what majorly let it down. Given the many plot turns, the writers could have done loads and easily turned this into better material. In all fairness, they do provide some funny lines. Jet Li is a good actor and his amazing martial arts skills can sometimes make an entire movie worth viewing. Yet, the way the film portrays his skills is very poorly done (close cropped camera limits the magnitude of the fight sequences). There are some good visual effects and some very bad ones. Performance-wise Jet Li does well with the limited characterization. Jason Statham and Delroy Lindo are passable. Carla Gugino is very good and she has great chemistry with Li. Overall, it's a missed opportunity."
