The girl who plays Maryam gives an incredible performance and i can't say enough good things about the script. It was an excellent tale about what it was like to be a regular American teen who happened to be of Iranian descent during the hostage crisis in '79. This film manages to be poignant and thought-provoking about race relations in America without beating the audience over the head with the \"SpikeLee Stick\". good and good for you.",
