        "reviewBody": "i first heard of tom tyler while watching an errol flynn western with my dad. he kept saying, watch this, watch this. the year was 1949. we had been the proud owner's of our first t.v. set. my dad was in his 40's and i was almost 5.\n\nthen it happened. and as it did my father had crept up behind me and was slapping me gently, but firmly on my shoulder. errol had put about 12 slugs in villan tom's back but he wasn't about to leave this mortal coil just yet. he staggered forward, off to the side three steps, down on one knee and then fell against the barn door under the light of the silvery moon and finally slid to his demise. i can only guess that mr. flynn was having his hair coiffed while he waited.\n\nmy dad loved that scene and i had to admit i sure would have liked to have seen in again three or four more times.\n\nin june my dad asked me if i would like to go up to my uncle lemon's and see a movie he was going to screen. (every family has a rich one) and to be honest i loved him very much.\n\nwell there it was the two of them had decided to surprise me with captain marvel. my father said 'this is tom tyler the guy from the errol flynn movie'. that started off an ole 'why didn't you tell me it was on?' from uncle lemon's.\n\ni fell in love with that serial the moment it started. tom tyler looked like captain marvel in the comic books. and the actor looked exactly the way that billy batson did.\n\ni have heard william witney describe while speaking with elwy yost on tv ontario how it was written and how some of the stunts were performed. (sequences where a giant balloon took over for captain marvel). i much prefered it to the way kyrk allyn turned into a cartoon character when he went up up and away in the first superman serial.\n\ni can see it as clearly as if it were yesterday. in this case i really can. among my collection of serials, captain marvel and superman go head to head.\n\nif you like this serial or have heard about it - buy it.\n\n the few dollars you spend cannot compare to the memories and the laughs you will share with your friends and family. trust me, although long departed the memory of my uncle lemon's and my one in a billion father,are there every time i run the serial. and everytime i watch it i chuckle when i remember that tom milked his part in Santa Fe Trail.........or was it Stagecoach. oh man the memories.\n\nlloyd davidson"
