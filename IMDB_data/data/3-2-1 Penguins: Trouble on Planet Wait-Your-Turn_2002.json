        "reviewBody": "3-2-1- Penguins! is a cartoon series made by the same company who brought us Veggietales, Big Idea Entertainment. Like Veggietales, this series started out as a direct-to-video series for its first season, releasing six videos from 2000 to 2003 (which qubo would edit and release as the first season in 2006).\n\nTrouble On Planet Wait-Your-Turn is the first video, as it sees twins Jason and Michelle dropped off at their grandma's house. After some scenes, the two go into the attic, and they find a telescope, which Michelle decides she will look first because she is the oldest, and the oldest gets to choose (which is a dumb excuse). Finding a toy spaceship, Jason puts the ceramic penguins his sister was playing with, but after dropping it, it comes to life, and the penguins, Zidgel, Midgel, Fidgel, and Kevin, choose to have him come aboard via the Gleezle, which allows him to shrink to their size, to help them on a mission on Planet Wait-Your-Turn, which mirrors what Jason has gone through.\n\nYeah, it's another educational video, but it's a good one. Teaching a good lesson on patience, it has good story, characters, and the computer animation is great for its time.",
