        "reviewBody": "How do you make a series three seasons long, without a single moment that makes you laugh? This series is without a doubt the ultimate example of a disaster. And no, these 'gags' weren't funny even back in the 1990s. Both the jokes and the physical humor are abysmal, and demonstrate total lack of understanding on the part of the writer and director of how humour works. The punch lines are nonexistent and so is the timing. You know, a child could rewrite each of these episodes and make it more funny. Oh, it's so unbelievably dull and outright retarded. If only it managed to fail so badly and be funny as a failure, but alas, no such luck. Unwatchable, literally. People often throw the word 'unwatchable' around without really meaning to say that. Well, this thing is literally, and without a hint of hyperbole, unwatchable.",
