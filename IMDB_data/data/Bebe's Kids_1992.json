Which is a comedian explaining how his date with this girl went. What's there not to talk about it was down right funny !!! :D I'm sure if all of you had a chance to illustrate your worst date that had a couple of laughs , you would. It's not meant do to anything else but tell you the story of robin Harris' date , and what a disaster it turned out to be. But in the end , kids are kids. No matter how rambunctious they are , we were all kids and did or at least wanted to do the same destruction. ' cuz were Bebe's Kids !! We don't die ! We multiply !!",
