Making this a prequel to a \"classic,\" he thinks moving the location to New Orleans and showing Mardi Gras and the addition of a bit of nudity will add luster to this series.\n\nI don't think Malcolm McDowell puts this on his resume. His acting like a crusty old southern gentleman is completely unbelievable. I wouldn't complain so much except he's English. I'm sure they could have picked an American for his dozen or so, scenes.\n\nI'm sure the only reason this DVD is bought is for the sex scenes between Paul Mercurio and Clara Bellar. Wright gives meaning to scenes ripped off from other movies, as Bellar and Mercurio have sex in many parts of the Dubois mansion.\n\nI can understand why I didn't watch this movie for six or seven years. It's THAT bad. Pink Flamingos is better than this, and that's saying something!",
