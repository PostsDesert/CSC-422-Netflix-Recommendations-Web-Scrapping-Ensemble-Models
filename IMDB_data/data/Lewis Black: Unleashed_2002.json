        "reviewBody": "This DVD consists of four Comedy Central specials starring Lewis Black. The first three (1998, 2000 and 2002) are his standard stand-up material. The fourth, a show about taxes, is taught in front of a classroom of college students. \n\nThe 1998 show features jokes about Bill Clinton and hummer jokes. The 2000 show about his hatred of Hillary Clinton (running for Senate in New York) as well as Bush and Gore...as he thinks both would make terrible presidents. He also makes fun of Arkansas...and my wife thought this was funny but unfair for poor old Arkansas. The 2002 show is about the Superbowl, how much he hates candy corn as well as 9/11 and why Hannukah sucks. All in all, while Black looks pretty young in some of this material, he is grouchy and angry throughout...as you'd expect from Black. The final segment is about taxes and government and Black does a couple cute interviews with Bob Dole and John McCain. \n\nIf you love Black, you'll love the DVD. If you hate him, well, then it's more of the same. I enjoyed it...but I have a high tolerance for his anger.",
