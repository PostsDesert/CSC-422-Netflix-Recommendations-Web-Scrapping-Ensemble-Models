With Cameo appearances from Pee-Wee Herman, Don Adams, Jerry Mathers, Tony Dow, Barbara Billingsly, Bob Denver, Alan Hale Jr., Fishbone, Stevie Ray Vaughn, and many others how could you go wrong. There is some killer surf footage. Plus Demian Slade has incredible comedic timing with his sarcasm. I love this movie."
