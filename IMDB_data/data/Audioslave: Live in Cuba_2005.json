It is a common misconception, shared by even the New York Times (see the article by Peter Watrous dated 2/15/99). \n\nAnd another thing: the purpose of the embargo is not to isolate Cuba from the US, it is to stop aid to a sworn enemy of the USA. It is Cuba who blocks or censors any foreign influence. The embargo is used by Cuba to justify everything from infant mortality to the crumbling infrastructure of the country. In fact, the US government has allowed sales of food to Cuba to the tune of over a billion dollars in the last 5 years, the problem is that Cuba does not want to pay cash and is looking for monetary aid to keep a disastrous form of government afloat."
