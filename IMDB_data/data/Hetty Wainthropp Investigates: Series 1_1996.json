Patricia Routledge surely shows that she's quite adept at performing in a mystery program as well as in comedies. I wonder if she (Hetty Wainthropp) ever investigated a\n\nmurder in any of these programs. I'm sure she'd do quite well. I know Patricia Routledge did an audio recording of some of these programs, but don't know where I can purchase them in the USA. If anyone can tell me, please contact kclarke5@juno.com. Let's hope PBS gets on the stick and rebroadcasts some of these programs, especially in Kansas City Public Television!"
