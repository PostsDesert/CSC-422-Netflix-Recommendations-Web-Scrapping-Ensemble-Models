It's still on at this moment but I'm so bored, I thought that I'd rant. This piece of work looks like is was made for under $1000. (I'd bet most of that was taken up by the $700 camera and construction lights they used to light the interviews, God knows they saved nothing for post.) Whoever mad this...please choose another career. I'm not being sarcastic...I'm serious. I'm falling asleep trying to stay interested in what I thought was a fascinating subject. -bleh!",
