        "reviewBody": "This film was somewhat pedestrian at first, but as it got into the heart and passion of the Vietnam era it really caught fire.\n\nDuring that time I was a naive teenager/college kid, with these events going around on the periphery. This movie helped to crystallize the past, as well as to connect it to the present. The statement John Kerry made, about asking someone, or someone's son (now include \"daughter\") to die for a lie holds so true today. Although Kerry has mellowed a lot in 34 years, if even a fraction the spark, the integrity and the bravery it took to volunteer for battle and then to see the truth and to fight for a just cause are still in him, I can be proud of my vote on Nov. 2nd.\n\nIt would be oh so illuminating to contrast the current president's past life and times during those same years with that of this impressively articulate and thoughtful man."
