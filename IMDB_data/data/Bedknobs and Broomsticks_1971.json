        "reviewBody": "It is unfortunate that this film receives such little comment, as compared to \"Mary Poppins\", for the simple fact that most people DO compare it to \"Mary Poppins\" amd really, it stands alone.\n\nThe story is quite original and well done. The actors are all wonderful, and Angela Lansbury, to me, will always be Miss Price. David Tomlinson is also wonderful as Professor Browne. The children are also great, with the standout being the youngest one, Paul. He has so many funny moments in this movie.\n\nAgain, the Sherman Brothers lend their creative song-writing talents to this film with excellent results. \"The Age of Not Believing\" is wonderful, as is \"Eglantine\", \"The Beautiful Briny\" and the superb \"Portobello Road\" number. The animation scenes are also great and imaginative.\n\nThis is certainly an enjoyable film on many counts, and should be remembered just as so many of the other Disney classics. It should also be seen in the recently restored version, which runs over two hours. The story is more fluent in that version, and the songs are intact, for the most part. A great movie."
