When I consider how low the budget was, and how long ago this was made, it adds to the appreciation of this.\n\nFor example, making a cliff face look like a plausible ice wall by opening the iris wide to let in more light. It's full of cliches - sort of. But remember, they weren't cliche at the time.\n\nIt is interesting that Ming seems rather reasonable in this - not the over-the-top monster we have come to know and loath - and love!",
