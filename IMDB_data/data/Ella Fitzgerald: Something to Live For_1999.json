        "reviewBody": "I grew up watching Ms. Fitzgerald in the glass-breaking Memorex commercials, which are shown in this DVD. Even then her voice was something to behold. This documentary captures Ella's golden era- before the various medical problems. The documentary itself is not perfect as it glosses over a few years and decades, and doesn't caption everything. But there are tons of clips showing concerts from Denmark, France, Germany, and the U.S., always stunning and always of a buoyant, incredibly shy woman, beautifully full of figure with a resonating, satin-like voice. (Check out the first torch ballad of \"Lover Man\" about three minutes into the DVD as the title comes on screen. A breathtaking piece.) There are also clips of the songs \"Misty,\" \"Summertime,\" and \"Azure Mood\" as well as interviews with Andre Previn, c. 1979-1980, and recollections from her band musicians. The TV show clips are what you really want to see: performances with Nat \"King\" Cole, Bing Crosby, Mel Torme', Dinah Shore and Joan Sutherland, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and probably the most memorable: a parry-and-thrust duet with Frank Sinatra on \"The Lady Is A Tramp\" from his own 1967 special. A nice time capsule of a timeless performer. Buy and watch."
