Just at the time of switching on the TV, I found the movie running in a movie channel and the beginning scenes made me watch through the reminder of the movies The movie is about how a professor of arts in Spain, Daniel Marin, uses his students to steal old paintings of art. He plots to pass the blame on his Ex-class mate, Sandra Walker, an arts consultant. Ms.Sandra Walker and Bruce Walker are an estranged couple on the verge of a broken marriage after siring a daughter. Ms.Walker's Boss, Victor Boyd, a collector of arts is the kingpin behind all this heist and with his connivance the art heist happens. Attempts were made to pass the suspicion on a Russian collector, Maximov, who was seen as a rival by Victor Boyd. Ms.Walker gets into trouble when she tries to spy on Maximov. Ms.Walker herself becomes a suspect when some implanted faxes were found in her office and her bank account found to be credited with large sum of money Sarah's husband Bruce walker, himself a policeman, gets deep into the investigations and saves her wife and also their marriage The plot was good and so is the direction. I loved the movie D.BALAJI"
