        "reviewBody": "Pretty much an obscure Donnie Yen action flick in the States when compared to the Ip Man series or Flashpoint. Which mean while this one is not an essential Donnie Yen movie to watch for martial arts/action movie fans, this is still a solid action film nevertheless.\n\nThis is the 4th films in the In The Line Of Duty series in which I never seen the previous films, so I don't know if this a standalone or a continuation of the series.\n\nAfter watching it, I don't even think this is a Donnie Yen vehicle, Yen only seem to be starring in this instead of being the real lead.\n\nBecause the real scene stealer is actress Cynthia Khan who played Madam Yeung, most of the best action scenes belong to her. Her fight scenes are better choreographed than Donnie Yen IMO. There's one notable scene involving a police van featuring dangerous stunts, but that scene feature Khan instead of Yen who is suppose to be the main hero.\n\nCheck out this one if you can find it but no need to rush. There are probably better retro Hong Kong action movies you haven't seen yet.",
