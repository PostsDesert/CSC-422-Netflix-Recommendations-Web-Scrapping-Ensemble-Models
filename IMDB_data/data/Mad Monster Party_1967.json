Boris Karloff brings his inimitable prescense to the voice of Baron Frankenstein. With this film and Bogdonovich's \"Targets\" the next year, this old master of the horror film couldn't have asked for a better send-off. And then there's Phyllis Diller, bringing her particular brand of wackiness (And a surprisingly good singing voice!) to the role of \"The Monster's Mate.\" The clay animation throughout is up to Rankin/Bass's usual excellent standard and the result is enjoyable, campy fun, at Halloween or anytime."
