The songs Dil Ne ye ...stands out standing and the one Na Na is also great especially the church scene. Sunil Shetty's acting remains great for me...basically a super movie and I would love to watch that again...Kudos for its director Darmesh Darshan I first watched this when I was in England and I owned a Video Cassette tape. However I used to watch its songs on Youtube. Then I bought a DVD of the same since moving to Australia. As the quality of the DVD was not good; I had to watch again from Youtube via Smart TV...which was simply but great...",
