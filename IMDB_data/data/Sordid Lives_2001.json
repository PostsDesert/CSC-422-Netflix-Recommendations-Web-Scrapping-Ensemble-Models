Filled with laughs over things you know you shouldn't be laughing at, but they are so ....\n\nNo slick filming, just down home, small town life and it's filmed that way.\n\nI could have done without the character Olivia Newton-John played, but she was funny while doing it! And it isn't her fault, the character just seems to be something tossed in because she was there.\n\nWhile it's funny, it has some things to say. Enjoy!",
