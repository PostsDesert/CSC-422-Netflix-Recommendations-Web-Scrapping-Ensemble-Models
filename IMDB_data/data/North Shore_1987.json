Though they don't show the traffic jams, long lines of JOJ Tourist whales at the Shave Ice Shack, who flock to see the famous North Shore and lay around on the sand smelling of Hawaiian Tropics cocoanut oil. My gripe is, the time frame. They make it look like you can become a pro class surfer in a few months. Folks, it taked years of hard surfing to become that good. No one learns it in a summer...The real surfers, \"Soul Surfers\" live and breathe salt water, on good and bad days. It HAS to be your life. There is no other way.",
