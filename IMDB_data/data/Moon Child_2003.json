Terrible acting, writing, and direction prove that pop stars should not be allowed to write or star in movies; the characters are underdeveloped and generate absolutely no sympathy -- in fact, the viewer is hard pressed to care if they live or die; the plot is all over the place; the special effects are cheap. Takahisa Zeze should never be allowed to direct another film. Gackt and HYDE are insufferable -- the movie should have been titled \"Hairdressers on Fire.\""
