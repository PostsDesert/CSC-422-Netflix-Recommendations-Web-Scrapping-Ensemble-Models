Gleefully bends the laws of physics, and plays with your reason in the finest HK (Hong Kong) tradition.\n\nI have shared this film with folks who had not previously experienced HK film, and they were instantly captivated. Or should I say captured. By the Ninjas.\n\nBecause -- this film's certainly got the Ninjas! Surf Ninjas! Sand Ninjas! Exploding Ninjas! Tree Ninjas! Flying Ninjas! Roof Ninjas! Giant Ninjas! Kite Ninjas! Naked Girl Ninjas! (Oh, that long-haired Naked Fu...)\n\nJust as with life, every time things quiet down in this film, you may be sure the Ninjas will pop up to keep things lively.\n\nWatch this and be captured. You have been warned."
