Maybe 30 viewings total, which is a ringing endorsement right there.\n\nThe story's frame is: Baby Bear is tired of Goldilocks stealing his thunder and finishing the alphabet when he stumbles reciting it. He enlists the help of Big Bird, and off they go on a learning journey accompanied by some other (unfamiliar-to-me) Sesame Street characters and cute kids. There are many old clips mixed into Big Bird's \"Method:\" Billy Joel, Alphabet Jungle, Twist, Twist, Twist...It's fun to see the 70' and 80's era stuff. Will Baby Bear succeed in his quest and finally silence Goldilocks???\n\nRecommended.",
