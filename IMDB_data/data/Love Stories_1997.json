        "reviewBody": "This is one of the worst movies I ever saw. Period.\n\nToo many symbols that lead to nowhere. Serious continuity errors (like band aid that somehow appears on colonel's face) and locations that make no sense (e.g. parking lot of the most ugly building in Warsaw aka Palace of Culture that supposedly is court building or whatever director/screen writer imagined).\n\nDedication to Kieślowski is a very sour joke. At least Kieślowski had enough self-esteem to hire others to write his screenplays. Mr. Stuhr is a very good actor and he should remain one.\n\nWorst of all: this movie is boring. One can not figure out why the same actor is playing four different people. I still wonder why some good actors, like Ms. Ostałowska, decided to take part in this production.\n\nYou can forget renting this movie. No loss: save 87 minutes of your life.",
