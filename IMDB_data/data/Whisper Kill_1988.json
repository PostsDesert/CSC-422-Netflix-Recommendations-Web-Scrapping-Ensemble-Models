        "reviewBody": "WHISPERKILL is a very early entry in the run of psycho thrillers that emerged in cinemas following the likes of FATAL ATTRACTION and (in particular) BASIC INSTINCT. Such films usually followed a cop (or pair of cops) as they investigated various psycho murders and find themselves getting too close to the suspect. This time around, blonde TV starlet Loni Anderson plays a reporter who's shocked when one of her rivals is bumped off by a vicious killer. Investigative reporter Joe Penny turns up to check things out and soon finds himself falling for her, although he becomes disturbed when he checks out his new love's background...\n\nThe thriller aspects of WHISPERKILL are handled well on a TV movie level, so it's a shame that this film instead chooses to be a cheap and cheesy love story for the most part, complete with cheesy songs on the soundtrack. Anderson and Penny do possess chemistry as the leads, but the leaden plotting makes this hard to sit through in places, although it picks up for the killer unveiling at the climax. It's hardly the stuff of greatness, though.",
