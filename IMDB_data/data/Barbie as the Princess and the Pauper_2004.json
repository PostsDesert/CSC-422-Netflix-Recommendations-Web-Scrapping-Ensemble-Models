It's Barbie's first musical, and the music, I think, is every bit as catchy as Beauty and the Beast.\n\nI love, love, love too that Barbie isn't \"rescued\" by the Prince. She saves the kingdom with her intelligence - not her status or appearance!\n\nIt's funny. My Dad was over here, and I was trying to explain the plot to him. It's complicated, but doesn't seem so when you're watching it from start to finish. I think that's a sign of a good movie - it's not mindless drivel. You have to pay attention, and follow the story.\n\nAlso - the DVD comes with sing-alongs. My 3 year old especially loves those. She knows all the words to these songs."
