        "reviewBody": "I felt that this movie was a great example of the Cuban government. This movie shows through a love story that the Cuban government is killing its' own people. The movie had many great examples of how the government treats its' people and that they see other opportunties outside of their own country. One major part of the movie is that many people want to leave Cuba to come into the United States for a better life. The movie can be directly related to the case today of Elian Gonzalez. The debate over where he should go, Miami or Cuba. This movie did a nice job of portraying Socialism in Cuba throughout the movie. I really enjoyed this movie because I learned a lot about the Cuban government but I also enjoyed the movie."
