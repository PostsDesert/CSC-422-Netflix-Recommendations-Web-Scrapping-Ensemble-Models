        "reviewBody": "Like most films about individual type sports i.e. skiing, surfing, scuba diving etc. it helps if you've tried the sport at least once to be able to relate to what the picture is about. A small three man parachuting team barnstorms their way from town to town putting on a skydiving show. They roll out of one town into another and rather than stay at a hotel they are taken in by a couple who are related to one of the skydivers. Kind of like sailors on liberty the three are looking for a good time and after an uneasy dinner with the couple strike out in search of female companionship. They eventually all find some and the film even has an extramarital affair between Lancaster and Kerr. Some unexpected events at the subsequent air show twist things around and the hard to figure out scenes of a high school band practicing finally comes in to perspective. Good skydiving scenes, a little romance, a little sex not a bad film to see especially if you've ever taken the plunge out of a perfectly good airplane.",
