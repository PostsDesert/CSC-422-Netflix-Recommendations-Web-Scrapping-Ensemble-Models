But IMDb is mistaken about the languages used in this film. There is absolutely no Esperanto at all. It's almost all English with a couple of words of Navajo. Do not watch this film if you're looking for Esperanto movies. Other options instead are \"Idiot's Delight\" (with Clark Gable) which has a bit of Esperanto, \"Incubus\" is all Esperanto (although completely mispronounced), and there are some Esperanto street signs in Charlie Chaplin's \"The Great Dictator.\" There was supposed to be some spoken Esperanto in \"Gattaca\" as well, but I never heard any. \n\nAside from that, the other reviewer is right. This movie is a complete mess.\n\nSpend your time elsewhere.",
