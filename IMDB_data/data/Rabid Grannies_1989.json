I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone.There are some funny moments, and I wouldn't say I wasted my time (I laughed a few times and I got to write this review, so that's always fun), but overall there are infinitely better gore-comedies out there. If you want to see something like this, only done with a little more professionalism (and a lot more gore), try \"Dead Alive\" or \"Bad Taste\". Those movies are funnier, plus, if you watch \"Bad Taste\", you'll get to see director Peter Jackson as a zombie.",
