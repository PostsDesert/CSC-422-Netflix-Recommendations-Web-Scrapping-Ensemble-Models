        "reviewBody": "This movie can be enjoyed by the whole family. A wholesome drama with some humor infused to lighten the mood despite difficult moments. A nice touching story about a family struck by hard times when the father, Clark Davis injured himself and the family risked losing everything they have because there is no one to help with the farming. Until a handsome young stranger comes along and pitches in to help. As the story unfolds, it's more of the family helping this young man, teaching him things that the family values: love, faith, endurance, and forgiveness. \n\nHighly recommended for the whole family!",
