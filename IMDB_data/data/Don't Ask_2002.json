But when Martin manages to free his mind, no one believes his story. Now it's up to the intrepid man of science to save the planet himself -- or die trying. Oh, sorry, that's Killers From Space, the the notorious public domain stinker starring Peter Graves.\n\nThis is that same film, but the soundtrack has been replaced turning it into a film about a threat from gay aliens to turn every earthling gay.\n\nYes, Peter Graves is there, but his dialog has changed. All the dialog from the original has been changed ala Woody Allen in What's Up, Tiger Lily? Graves returns from space saying \"fabulous\" frequently, and holding a picture of Ted Kennedy in order to have sex with his wife.\n\nIf you find just half the lines and gaga in this film funny, it will be worth your time.",
