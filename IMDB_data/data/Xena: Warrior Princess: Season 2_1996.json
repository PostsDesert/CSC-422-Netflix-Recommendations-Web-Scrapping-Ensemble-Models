        "reviewBody": "It's the year 2007 but I still watch the episodes over and over again. I love this show and I am very sad that it ended. I memorised the episodes and the lyrics of the soundtrack. I can say for sure that 6 episodes is not enough for a show like this. I wish there was a movie of the show. I know that now Lucy and Rob have a very happy family with 3 children. I wish a very healthy and happy future to them and to all of the crew! Xena's courage changes the world! I have seen that Lucy and Renee and the other stars have also acted in many other movies and shows. They mean so much to me and they are very valuable! I will purchase every single one of these movies even if they played only short parts. To see their face will brighten my day as they are really good at what they are doing. They are very good in making the audience feel the passion in everything they do. We love you so much! Love, Deniz",
