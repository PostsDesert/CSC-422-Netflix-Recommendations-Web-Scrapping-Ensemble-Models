Sure, the acting was fine but the storyline was not. I was bored and I thought it took too long to get where it was going. The occult was thrown in there but was not really elaborated on. Who was \"the father?\" They were always talking about the father, I never understood what cult they were trying to be. The acting, however, is quite good in my opinion, but it does not make up for lack of story. This film appears to be a small Canadian film as the Alliance logo was at the front of it. If you are looking for a cool Canadian film, try The Boys Club. The story is a bit more interesting."
