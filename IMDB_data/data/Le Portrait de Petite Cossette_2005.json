Maybe I'm not a fan of a lot of old anime animation but if its done right as well as the story, no problem. However both in this anime case did. The story was just so unoriginal and boring. It was like it came from the Annabelle series but in a lighter tone.\n\nYeah I'm out with this anime unfortunately.....",
