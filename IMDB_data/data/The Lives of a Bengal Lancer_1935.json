Also new to regiment is Donald Stone : Richard Cromwell , the son of current commanding General : Sir Guy Standing . All three will soon test their courage when the Brits encounter a vicious local revolution against colonial rule . They are gallant heroes , the Bengal Lancers , hamdsome stalwarts , often out-numbered , never out-fought . The thrill of a Kiss, the joy of combat... , these , they fought for .. dangerously , recklessly , madly ! . Night find them in the warm arms of love .. or the cold clutch of death !\n\nOne of Hollywood's greatest rousing adventures including noisy action , comradeship , heroism and spectacular final battle . A sweet plot in which predominates a sensitive friendship , great comraderie and brave feats . Being based on the novel written by Major Francis Yeats Brown and interesting script from John Balderston , Waldemar Young and Grover Jones , being remade in 1939 .Trio of protagonists : Gary Cooper , Franchot Tone , Richard Cromwell are pretty good . Well accompanied by a large and notorious support cast, such as : Guy Standing , C Aubrey Smith, Kathleen Burke , Douglas Dumbrille , Monte Blue , J. Carrol Naish , Akim Tamiroff , among others . It was shot by cameraman Charles Lang with exteriors from Lone Pine , California , and spectacular settings , in fact some sets were taken for The Crusades 1935 by Cecil B DeMille . And some years earlier, filmmaker Ernest B. Schoedsack filmed scenes on location in India that were subsequently used.\n\nThe motion picture was stunningly directed by Henry Hathaway. He was an expert on Western , such as : \"Brighham Young Frontiersman\" , \"The Shepherd of the Hill\" , \"Rawhide\" or \"Desperate Siege\" , \"From Hell to Texas\" , \"5 Card Stud\", \"True Grit\" and Adventure , such as : \"The Black Rose\" , \"White Witch Doctor\" , \"Legend of the Lost\" , \"Circus World\" , among others . Rating : 7/10 . Essential and fundamental seeing for classic Hollywood enthusiasts anf Gary Cooper fans .",
