This documentary runs 130-minutes and at times it becomes rather long but overall it offers a lot of great stories from a man who was right there all through the ups and downs. The best moments happens when Esposito talks about the day Elvis died and we get to see various news broadcasts breaking the news to the public. He also puts to rest several rumors about the day Elvis died and once again, just seeing the pain as he's telling the story makes it seem impossible that Elvis faked his death or whatever other rumors are out there. There's also plenty of concert footage, movie clips and rare home movies and photos."
