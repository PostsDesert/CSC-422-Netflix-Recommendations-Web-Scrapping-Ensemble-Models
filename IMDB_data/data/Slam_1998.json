A 'black gangsta' movie that doesn't rely on mindless violence to give you the 'message'.\n\n The 'message' from this movie is beautiful and the poetry is mindblowing (especially the last poem). The acting is excellent throughout and the funny thing is that all the acting is natural and it seems like you are a watching a gritty documentary. (Look out for the jail riot and you will understand what I mean).\n\nA highly recommended movie, do not miss it."
