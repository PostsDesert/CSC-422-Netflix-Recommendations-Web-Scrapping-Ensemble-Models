To me, and to so many others, it is unequaled in it's beauty, sensitivity and deep spiritual perception into this amazing world that we inhabit.\n\nReally, I think if anyone watches this film and cannot feel uplifted to the heavens, then they must be spiritually deadened by cynicism and negativity.\n\nEven without DVD and the big screen, we have enjoyed repeated viewing of this EXCEPTIONAL film. I first saw it in Sydney, in Panavision's huge screen, and was totally blown away by the cinematography as well as the profoundly moving music. But even on VHS here at home, it touches me ever so deeply.\n\n10 out of 10. An incredible experience!!"
