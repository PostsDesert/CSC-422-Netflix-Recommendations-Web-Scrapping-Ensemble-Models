Kept me laughing the whole way - the Ryan Reynolds Jerry O'Connell tandem rock solid. If you liked this, and you should for what it was (Ebert could lighten up but then again he probably can't be PC and give this movie anything more than zero stars), check out Tomcats - similarly funny and original. The Ryan Reynolds naked seen all too familiar and funny like a similar fate that met O'Donnell in \"Tomcats\" with a little kid thinking he's a perv, providing equal laughs. Alyssa Milano is a great addition here too, overall very solid goofy movie that had some original lines and laughs and great physical comedy. what's not to like, unless you are overly stiff",
