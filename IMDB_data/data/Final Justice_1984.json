Fortunately for myself, I saw the MST version thus saving myself from any pain. This movie so deserves to be on the bottom 100 list. The dialogue to this movie is awful, much like the acting. Don't bother getting me started on the plot. Never ever see this movie unless it's the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version."
