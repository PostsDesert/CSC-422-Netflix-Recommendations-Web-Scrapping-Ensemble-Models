        "reviewBody": "Khuda Gawah is certainly one of the most epic films of Indian cinema. Starring two biggest megastars of India Sridevi and Amitabh Bachchan,Khuda Gawah is a must watch. Beautiful direction,melodious and evergreen songs,beautiful performances and above all chemistry of Sridevi and Amitabh. With this movie Sridevi became the only actress in the history of Indian cinema to bag a double role in a Amitabh Bachchan starrer. I think this is the best and the greatest role ever written for an actress opposite Amitabh Bachchan. The first half is mind blowing and unforgettable. The introduction scene of Sridevi,is the greatest introduction scene ever given to an actress. Amitabh Bachchan in his pathan avatar is brilliant as always. I think this is his most underrated performance. Sridevi yet again deliver another great performance which in my view is her best performance and her best double role. She is a treat to watch in the role of Benazir and she is Benazir mean unparallel. The ending scene,song and reunion of Sridevi and Amitabh Bachchan is so emotional that it can make you cry. Overall a masterpiece by Mukul S Anand. Also one of the best soundtracks(all songs) and one of the greatest background musics of Bollywood. Sridevi and Amitabh at their best. My most favorite movie of all time and most favorite performances of my most favorites Sridevi and Amitabh Bachchan. All hail for the Last Empress and Emperor of Indian cinema.",
