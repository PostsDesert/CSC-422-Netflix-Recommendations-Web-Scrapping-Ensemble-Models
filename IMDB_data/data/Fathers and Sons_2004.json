        "reviewBody": "With Jeff Goldblum being the star I thought this was going to be a dark murder mystery but I was very disappointed with this movie. I don't know if the movie tried to be a moral movie about don't do drugs, talk to your parents if you have something bad on your mind, or a murder mystery? Why was other top notch actors such as Samuel L. Jackson, John C. McGinley, and Famke Janssen used in the film? McGinley was uncredited and I don't know why? What was really the purpose of having Rosanna Arquette as the psychic? All four had such short roles in the film. Through out the beginning is all there was the big talk about the chew and didn't find out what the chew is until the middle. I really don't know what I watched. Jeff Goldblum performed very well. If you must watch this movie prepare for a hundred minute boring fest! If you are not sure about renting the film or not don't let the box fool you! Avoid it no matter what you do! Though if you want to see another Goldblum movie however watch the superior Mister Frost!",
