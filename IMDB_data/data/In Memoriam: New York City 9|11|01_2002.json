        "reviewBody": "Can HBO do any wrong? Another stellar documentary from the network that brought us the great \"Capturing the Friedmans\".\n\n\"In Memoriam\" is thought-provoking and brings a viewer to tears all over again. Contains some incredible footage not seen elsewhere, including two unbelievable shots of the planes striking the towers. Also contains some new coverage of Guiliani's actions on the day of the attack - love him or hate him the city couldn't have asked for a better leader that day, and the footage bears this out. There is also some disturbing content (not that most of it isn't) of bodies falling from the towers, but nothing gratuitous, just enough to provide full coverage of what happened that dreadful day. Don't think you've seen all the 9/11 coverage if you haven't seen this. Just great.",
