This movie where empathises with the Indian musicians on one hand, also brings out the tale of a son of a rich father who takes a stand against his father. The movie has some really beautiful music (mostly light Hindustani classical) and of course has the battle to live poor and dying than to ask support from the father.\n\nCan't say its a must-see for everybody. I don't even know why I love it so much other than the music. But still there is something in it that brings me back at it, probably my respect for the musicians or probably my lack of strength to take a stand like that.",
