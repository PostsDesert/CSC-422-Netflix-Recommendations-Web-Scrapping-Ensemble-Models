She sings (live !) very well, the power of her voice is still amazing, and there's an incredible energy in her show. Really much more that in the one from Beyonce. Christina speaks a lot with her fans and the atmosphere is crazy. The dancers are extraordinary. Sets are great with fans, fire, huge screens, smoke, ... Special mention goes to Fighter (what energy !!!), At Last (Great), Beautiful (Wondeful song as usual), the Voice Within and What a Girl Wants. Congratulations Xtina and you know, you're are much more pretty with blacks rather than blonds hairs ;)",
