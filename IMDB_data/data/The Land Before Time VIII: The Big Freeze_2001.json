        "reviewBody": "Unfortunately, this LBT has a spoilt, usually positive Ducky who is now grumpy and a storyline that is good for teaching but not very good for a LBT film. \n\nLuckily, the plot is all right and the songs are good, especially \"Family\" and the learning songs. The animation is quite good as well, sort of in between LBT 7's animation and LBT 9's animation. \n\nThe new characters are entertaining. Mr. Thicknose is a wise threehorn (they are all dinosaurs) who likes to teach Littlefoot and his friends. While he talks to them again, Ducky is angry at Spike and Littlefoot is worried that he is seeming to upset Mr. Thicknose. The film continues on as a pretty good learning adventure and an adventure good for an animated film.\n\nThe best character in this who is one of the main five is Petrie.\n\nAh well. Enjoy \"Land Before Time VIII: The Big Freeze\".",
