        "reviewBody": "I think there are only two truly great films about film making. One is Fellini's \"eight and a half\" and the other is this. We witness the transformation of a man from factory worker into artist. All achieved through the use of his camera and more specifically, the things he sees through the camera's lens. Kieslowski is clearly telling a story close to his heart here and shows the audience both the joy and freedom art can bring but also more tellingly, the obsession that can overtake ones life.\n\nThe performances are great and the film, in my opinion, is given further impact due to the political undertones that are unavoidable.\n\nKieslowski even seems to be condoning censorship by pointing out that when it occurs, it forces film makers to find ways around it and produce superior work as a consequence.\n\nNot a perfect film by far but a film that points the way to a career that would continue to rise",
