        "reviewBody": "As Farah Khan well-stated in one of her interviews, these days all the films are splitting into specific genres, whereas Main Hoon Na revives the old Bollywood masala formula of some action, romance, comedy, drama, suspense, and big stars. There isn't any breakthrough story or anything extraordinarily special about this movie to make it \"hatke.\" This is just out-and-out a feel-good film. I haven't seen a movie like this in a long time, and Farah has done an excellent job of making the movie feel very fresh, whether it is through the creative cinematography, an interesting starcast, melodic tunes, or a good script. Songs are great. Shahrukh, of course, is awesome. After a long time I'm seeing Sushmita. She also adds to the freshness. When I first found out that Zayed Khan was in this movie, I was like, That guy is weird. Surprisingly enough, he was perfect for the role. Lucky Farah--she's got a superhit!",
