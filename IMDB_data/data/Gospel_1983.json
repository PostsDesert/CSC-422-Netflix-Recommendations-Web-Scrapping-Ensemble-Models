        "reviewBody": "To my ears, some of these gospel songs in here, all sung by black performers, are unbelievably good and or brutally horrible. It depends where you are coming from, what kind of music you like and what you are used to hearing in church, I suppose. For me, a middle-aged white guy, I love the rockin' toe-tapping fast songs. Man, if those songs don't get your blood going, check yourself into the nearest funeral home. The slow songs....well...just not my cup of tea.\n\nSo, the songs I loved here are \"Came To Jesus\" by The Mighty Clouds Of Joy; \"Until I Found The Lord/Right On\" by the Walter Hawkins Family; \"(This Joy)The World Didn't Give It To Me\" by Shirley Caesar; \"Hallelujah\" by the Clark Sisters, and \"Can't Nobody Do Me Like Jesus\" by the Rev. James Cleveland. There is one slow song I liked: \"What A Friend We Have In Jesus\" by Hawkins.\n\nThose fast-moving songs in here are so good that they more than make up for the lesser ones. The concert ends on a high note and a fun note as it appears the song is over several times but it isn't as the drummer refuses to leave and keeps going! That obviously is staged, but who cares? It's fun to watch. The audience is fun to watch, too. They really get into it. So should you! \n\nThis concert film is over 20 years old, praised by critics - even the very secular ones - and yet I am the only reviewer as of Feb. 2006? Wow, what a shame. You guys are missing a treat!",
