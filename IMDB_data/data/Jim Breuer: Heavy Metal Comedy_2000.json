He does do killer impressions, and he can sing heavy metal style! But, Comedy is really hard simply because it gets dated very quickly. He might have been totally hilarious in the early 2000s, but now he is just funny. Ouch. The DVD includes a 45-minute documentary with behind the scenes. Worth watching once.",
