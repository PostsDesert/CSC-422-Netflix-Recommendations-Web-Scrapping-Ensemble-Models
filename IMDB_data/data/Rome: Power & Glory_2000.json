        "reviewBody": "I echo the previous viewer's sentiments, plus a few more. As he noted, something about the narration of Peter Coyote sustained my interest effortlessly throughout the series. Very good writing and visuals also made this a premium work. It was divided into six parts: The Rise, Legions of Conquest, Seduction of Power, Grasp of Empire, The Cult of Order, and The Fall, each approximately 52 minutes long. I learned much about Roman history I had not known, and appreciate more than ever the profound effect Roman energy and concepts exerted through Medieval, Renaissance, and Enlightenment times -- clear up to the present day. The failures of Rome, echoing now in the actions and conditions of the United States, are also abundantly clear -- pointing to the need for a new vision of state, world, and individual existence, and what it is all about.",
