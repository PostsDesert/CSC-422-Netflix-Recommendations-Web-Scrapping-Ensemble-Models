I just didn't know exactly what to expect since they were long past their \"prime.\" However, like a number of other '60s groups that are still playing, these guys are still very good. Age doesn't seem to hurt their ability to sing, play instruments and entertain in concert.\n\nMost of the songs were the classics of the group, the ones that made them famous. These gray-haired \"old-timers\" were very animated and really into the concert, and did a great job with their old songs. The concert had some electricity to it. The crowd appreciated their efforts and made this a fun DVD to watch and hear.\n\nOverall, this is solid music by a classy group, who may look old but can still rock and sing with the best of 'em.",
