I would love to see how the characters turned out years later. Sarah and Helen are great in this movie. And I think Sarah did alot of her own stunts because she was doing gymnastics at the time. The dancing is great and the music is pure 80's fun. The movie has a good storyline that moves along with just the right amount of suspense and timing. This is a fun, feelgood dance movie. I highly recommend it."
