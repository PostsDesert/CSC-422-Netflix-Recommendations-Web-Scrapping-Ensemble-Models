        "reviewBody": "Carlos Mencia, Not for the Easily Offended is a hilarious commentary on America and the human condition. Mencia is a semi Socratic laugh at all Americans and their silly habit of generalizing and categorizing each other. As well as our intentional ignorance of our own hypocrisy takes main stage. While Mencia's premise is that there are stupid people everywhere, he does bring the cr√®me of the crop to the stage. If you can't laugh at yourself, you have no right to laugh at anyone else. This is not intellectual comedy and I have a feeling Carlos would not perform subtle intellectual comedy well. He is much better performing his bashing style with a free reign. Good comedy with plentiful bad language and suggestiveness. Good work Carlos.",
