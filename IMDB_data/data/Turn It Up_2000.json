Ja Rule was better but that's not saying much. These two have no business in front of a camera. The story was AWWWWWWWWFULL. The camera work was terrible. Whoever directed this has NO TALENT. And whoever financed this movie is CRAZY! The only thing i liked was the rear shot of the girlfriend (tamala jones) walking into the kitchen. But even then , she grabs for her top as if she has family members present on the set. The music in the movie was terrible. Pras would have been booed off stage with that performance. And he should have gotten slapped for wearing a freaking white leather \"elvis\"-like suit on stage in an underground hip-hop club. The only film worse is \"Corrupted\" with Silk the Shocker and Ice-T. OMG. That has to be no doubt THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE! I give that a -10 out of 10. This one i give a 1 out of 10."
