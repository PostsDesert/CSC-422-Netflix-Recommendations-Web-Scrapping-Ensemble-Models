Please stay awake for the ( not mentioned) explosions ripped out of delta force 2 , the colombian connection ( the helicopter that shoots the lincoln) and Tony denison who played Luca in crime story.\n\nAll known actors are just here to collect their months rent and the movie doesnt know if it wants to be a thriller or a horror, the snakes - allthough pictured widely on the box- are just a small part of this film.\n\nBut besides all this it is worth a watch, uncle treat is always good even in cheese flicks like this, just be ready for a cheap outbreak clone and not for a snake movie."
