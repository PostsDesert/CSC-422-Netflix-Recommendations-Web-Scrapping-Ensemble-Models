But this movie doesn't stop there and adds another layer, intertwining the story of Bob Saint Clar, the perfect spy, with the one of its creator, the writer François Merlin, and raises the level one step higher.\n\nIt goes also with a nice duo of actors: Belmondo enjoying himself, and ourselves, and Jacqueline Bisset - previously James Bond girl - which shines on the movie with her double role.\n\nWithout disclosing the story, you'll have a very good time.",
