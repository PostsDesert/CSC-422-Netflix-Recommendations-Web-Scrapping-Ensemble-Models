        "reviewBody": "Mahô tsukai ni taisetsu na koto (What Is Important To A Mage), or Someday's Dreamers (English title), was an anime series that was popular on Japanese television. It has received a pretty decent English dub for Western audiences on DVD, although much is left to the imagination through gaps in dialogue. The quality of the animation is very good and the music is very pretty, especially the title and end songs, which are very catchy songs to hum.\n\nThe story is about a young mage who comes to Tokyo to learn her craft. She's a junior in high school and lives on campus, away from her family. She meets various attractive young men who take an interest in her, but the sensuality in this series is very subdued and non-threatening. There is no bad language and very little violence. One character smokes too much but that's about it.\n\nThere are segments on YouTube from Someday's Dreamers but I suggest you track down the DVDs. You will enjoy it a lot more than watching on a 2 inch screen. They come in 3 separate volumes, 12 episodes in all, and you can choose original Japanese with subtitles or the English dub.\n\nMy 12 year old daughter really enjoyed this series so I can recommend it for pre-teens. It's a wholesome, loving show."
