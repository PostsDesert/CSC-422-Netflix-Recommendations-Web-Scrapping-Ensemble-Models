This is a wonderful technique film, a study of art film, an abstract film, a joy to watch. The story might be a bit complicated for most to keep up but the beauty of it is - it's complexity. The grandmother was wonderful as well as the dog and the cyclist -- but what blew me away was the overdrawn charatures of the characters.\n\nAnd there will be no more \"frogs\" for me, ladies! :)\n\nA deserved USA Oscar nomination. In a Pixar world, bring on more like these to keep the balance too!",
