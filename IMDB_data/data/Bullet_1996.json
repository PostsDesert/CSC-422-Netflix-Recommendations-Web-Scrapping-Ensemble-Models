I must admit when I first seen this movie in the store, I was surprised I hadn't heard of it and I'm glad I got this little bargain bin gem. I'm a fan of gangster movies in general, in particular films in the 90's, and if you liked those type of movies I would recommend this film. The film does have a dark, gritty feel to it and Mickey Rourke really does a good job in this film as well as 2pac as the villain. This movie may seem like an action film, but its more a crime Drama as it has some depth and seriousness to it in terms of plot and characters.for what it is it's a good straight to video flick with a great cast (notice a young adrien brody and Donnie Wahlberg).Its definitely worth a watch.\n\nOverall : 7/10",
