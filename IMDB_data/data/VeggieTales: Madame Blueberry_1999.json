        "reviewBody": "If you're sick and tired of purple dinosaurs and other shows that pander to kids without making any effort to amuse the adults forced to be in the same room with the TV, and especially if you are a proponent of Christian values, you should give VeggieTales a try. The premise sounds silly -- personified vegetables with names like Junior Asparagus and Larry the Cucumber, enacting moralistic tales -- but it comes across well, better than most Saturday-morning cartoons that are on these days. The songs are very catchy, and best of all, the humor is multi-faceted: not only do the stories appeal to kids, but they are also obviously intended to amuse adults (and they succeed admirably, at least among the adults I know who have seen the videos). This particular story involves a blueberry who goes overboard buying stuff at \"Stuff-Mart\", where you can buy everything you could ever possibly want, until she learns that being thankful for what you have is much more important than having a lot of things.\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say about this particular \"episode\" is that the silly song segment (like an intermission in the middle of the shows) is really lame. Other than that it's wonderful.",
