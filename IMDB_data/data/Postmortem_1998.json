        "reviewBody": "Having watched numerous Charlie Sheen movies, and seen more or less the same type of performances from him in each one, I was not expecting this. Charlie Sheen manages to pull off quite a watchable performance as James Magregor, a weary but hardened cop, who goes to Glasgow for some light relief from his lifestyle...?....The film itself was quite slow, but the choice of location and the addition of a few smaller actors who are barely recognisable from other films, made the look of the film quite arthouse and cult-like compared with most of Sheen's other film work. There is a lot of use of the steady-cam, which at times becomes an annoyance,but it doesn't detract from the film The director really seems to capture the tension and fear in the film, and for a film that was shot entirely in twelve days with a mostly unknown cast, that aint bad. Overall, good thriller with some great support from the excellently cast unknowns! A must see for Sheen fans!"
