        "reviewBody": "Michael Curtiz was a genius director, don't you agree? Masterpieces like \"Casablanca\" \"The Adventures Of Robin Hood\" \"The Charge Of The Light Brigade\" \"Mildred Pierce\" and over 150 other titles including the musical \"Romance on the High Seas\" which introduced Doris Day to the world. In \"Young Man with a Horn\" Doris Day is the luminous center, the ideal. She is photographed and framed like a reachable dream. Kirk Douglas plays the trumpet player in love with the wrong woman and Lauren Bacall here is the personification of the wrong woman, she knows it, she tells him but he goes for it like a lamb to the slaughter. \"Young Man with a Horn\" has some extra pluses, Hoagy Carmichel for instance and Juano Hernandez but what the film reminded me of was, Michael Curtiz's brilliance and that Doris Day was, is and always will be one of the great film actresses of all time. Regardless of the film she appeared in, she displayed an extraordinary talent to be, to be totally and if you think I'm just waxing lyrical, \"Young Man with a Horn\" presents indisputable evidence of her extraordinary talent.",
