Surprisingly I found myself actually enjoying this seedy little mid seventies sexsploitation piece.\n\nThe plot is nothing to speak of - journalism major decides to do a piece on swinging cheerleaders and their jock boyfriends.\n\nWhere the film surprises is in it's scripting - surprisingly liberated considering this was 1974 and somewhat witty with a bevy of interesting performances from a game cast, this turned out to be far more entertaining than expected.\n\nFun seventies drive-in fair and somewhat more layered than you may think. A solid six out of ten.",
