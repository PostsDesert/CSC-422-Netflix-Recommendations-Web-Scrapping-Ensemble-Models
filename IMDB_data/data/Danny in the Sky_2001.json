He pursues women the entire movie, finally ending up with one of the most annoying women in the movie. One wants to knock that ever-present camera right out of her hands.\n\nThe movie itself is so-so. None of the characters are especially likable and the bitter dad looks almost as hunky as his onscreen son.\n\nThis movie is a world of men who dress in ridiculous effete clothing and try and act studly. not really worth more than a look at the main character who is truly beautiful."
