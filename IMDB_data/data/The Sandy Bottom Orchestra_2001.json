We enjoyed the film and it made a nice quiet date night.\n\nIf you live in a small town you will recognize many of the characters and themes. \n\nThe story revolves around the mother and daughter, their stories intertwined but each stands on its own.\n\nMy three teenage boys probably wouldn't have cared for it. But if you have a teenage daughter she'll probably love it.\n\nThis based on a book by Garrison Keillor. If you like his \"Praire Home Companion\" show you'll like this.",
