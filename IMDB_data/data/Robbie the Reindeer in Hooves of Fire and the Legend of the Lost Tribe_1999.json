Perhaps it's because my husband is British, but I'm one American who really enjoyed this and who shudders to think of Britney Spears doing Jane Horrocks' role. I agree that it's not as terrific as Hooves of Fire, and I too noticed the absence of Vixen, but I thought overall it was very funny and clever, and my 18-month-old daughter seemed to enjoy it as well. I'd love another sequel. Perhaps I just differ from other Americans in terms of what I'm looking for -- I don't need \"holiday cheer\" or to be \"uplifted\" (although I found both here, actually) -- I just need intelligent writing and some decent acting, both of which are supplied here in abundance.",
