        "reviewBody": "ARACHNOPHOBIA brilliantly takes a simple fear of spiders and magnifies it to monstrous proportions!\n\nA highly venomous super-spider from Venezuela finds its way to small town America. As luck would have it, Dr. Ross Jennings (Jeff Daniels) and family, have just moved into the same town. Little do they know that the aforementioned arachnid has set up shop on their new home's property. Horror and hilarity soon unfold when the eight-legged menace manages to start a tiny population explosion of killer offspring!\n\nThis movie gets the whole horror / comedy balance just right, not sacrificing one for the other. There are an equal amount of chills and laughs. Daniels is great in his role, as is Julian Sands as the hyperbolic Dr. Atherton. John Goodman puts in a nice, extended cameo as Delbert the exterminator.\n\nSpecial mention must be made of the spider wrangler, for making these creatures appear intelligent and terrifying! You'll never look at attics or basements in quite the same way again!..."
