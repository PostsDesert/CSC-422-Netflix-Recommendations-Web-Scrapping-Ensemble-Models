All of the cast (okay, Eddie didn't grab me... but he also didn't really *do* or *say* anything) was brilliant. The dialogue was fun, the acting was top-notch. Even when the story faltered (and it did drag a couple of times), I feel that the people involved more than made up for it. The only actor I knew going into the piece was Dean O'Gorman, and I was pleased and impressed with his performance. Definitely nice to see him doing something serious (my first exposure being from Young Hercules). I highly recommend the film to anybody in the mood for something a bit unusual and a little slower-paced.",
