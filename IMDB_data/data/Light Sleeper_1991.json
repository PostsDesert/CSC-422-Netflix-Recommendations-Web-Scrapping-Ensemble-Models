There were some priceless moments in which Dafoe made the art of acting appear effortless. This is pure joy for a film fan. Sarandon was superb in a role which I think was a departure for her. Still, she brought intelligence, command, and a delightful wackiness to Ann. I disliked the score so much that I basically ignored it. The presence of these two commanding actors, Dafoe and Sarandon, plus other notables in the cast, convinced me that this will be a film I'll watch again and again, if only to see Dafoe's toothy smile!"
