        "reviewBody": "Completely agree with the previous reviewer that this was not a compilation made with any enthusiasm and the narration in particular is without emphasis or the apparent interest of the narrator; it seems almost whispered for the most part. There is a serious doubt in my mind that Elvis actually said a lot of the supposed 'in his own words' dialogue which, as your previous reviewer said, was presented in a voice absolutely nothing like that of the man himself. The former co-stars appeared to have been interviewed ad hoc with no attempt at quality. On the plus side Elvis' story is interesting and this production did suggest substantial reasons - i.e. mother fixation, shame of his father, complete subjugation by Parker - for why he was in his private life such a dysfunctional man. The film clips were good to re-visit but this is sadly a lacklustre production dealing as it does with one of the most publicly charismatic men of modern times.",
