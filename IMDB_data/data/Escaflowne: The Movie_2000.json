        "reviewBody": "Escaflowne the Movie while visually stunning and aided by an enchanting musical score just seems to fall short of being as epic as it could have been. With a running time of 98 min. events and character development seem rushed and unfulfilled. We never really get to know the characters and even though many viewers will have already seen the TV series that's still no excuse for the lack of content. Hitomi seems to shift from a depressed school girl on the verge of suicide to a strong supportive heroine without much coaxing or personal experience. The full legend of the Escaflowne and Wing Goddess as well as the mythology of Gaia are also never fleshed out for us. The final confrentation between the two brothers is a far cry from what could have been. And the ending leaves something to be desired as well, not as fairy tale as some might have wanted. However inspite of these problems I still enjoyed Escaflowne the Movie. It is a feast for the eyes and ears, and as a theatrical adaption it has no problem standing on its own. Definitly recomended ^_^",
