I saw the whole thing as one great spoof on every imaginable cultural and plot stereotype. I found myself suspending disbelief, hardly able to wait to discover how the author would resolve the conflict without anyone telling the police, yet never took any of it seriously. It even poked fun at the typical happy ending and the Motion Picture Code rules. That's the way it struck me. I have to confess that I was watching at midnight, ready for anything light, and that I like dogs.",
