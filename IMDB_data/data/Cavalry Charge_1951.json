        "name": "Below average Chorizo Western dealing with Canadian Mounted Police , being lousily directed by Ramón Torrado",
        "reviewBody": "In a fort located in the remote lands of Canada, a regiment of North West Mounted Police with plenty of soldiers dressed in deep red , being commanded by a tough commandant , there two men (Frank Latimore, Alan Scott) face each other over a woman (Maria Silva) . But a young Indian girl (Diana Lorys) is in love with one of them. Along the way, our protagonist John Bedford (Alan Scott) is assigned to find some outlaws who have killed some fur sellers and Indians, in order to prevent an Indian war led by Chief Brown Bear (José Truchado) . However, he is taken prisoner by the Indians along with the two bandits (Barta Barri, Tito Garcia) and tied to a central post in the camp of the Indian tribe to be sacrificed, eventually they are saved by the young India and manage to reach the fort . But there things go wrong.\n\nThis is effortless and inferior story in Paella Western sub-genre style , thus the picture mingles the Canadian theme similarly to ¨Unconquered¨ by Cecil B De Mille along with Indian attacks and traitor bandits . As the movie follows more the American models than Spaghetti wake . As it results to be a familiar film , with no much violence and action enough . A very mediocre Western quite poorly shot with poorly staged action scenes. Although there are plenty of extras and impressive Indian attacks alongside a spectacular attack on a fort with a number of horsemen falling from their horses , the film turned out to be very disappointing. The picture contains a breathtaking and overwhelming final battle with hundred extras , when the regiment is really besieged by Indians . Regularly played by two B-American actors Alan Scott as the hero who sets out in a manhunt and Frank Latimore who plays middlingly an upright and stiff commandant . And many other familiar faces from Chorizo/Spaghetti Western , there appears ordinary secondaries as Alfonso Rojas , Bernabe Barta Barri , Rufino Inglés , Fernando Bilbao , Rafael Hernández , Tito García , Xan das Bolas , Alfonso de la Vega, Guillermo Méndez , Luis Barboo , and several others. Mediocre photography by Francisco Sempere , being necessary a right remastering because of the film copy is washed out , filmed on location in Las Rozas , Manzanares , Navacerrada , Colmenar Viejo , Madrid . The movie was produced in budget enough by Atlantida Films/Jose Frade productions that financed several Western during the 60s and early 70s such as ¨Cuatreros¨ , ¨Mestizo¨ , ¨Challenge of McKenna¨ , ¨The mercenary¨ , ¨Los Compañeros¨, ¨twenty dollars for seven¨ and ¨Saddle tramps¨ , among others.\n\nThis so-so Western was middlingly photographed , -though being marred by a worn-out cinematography- by Ricardo Torres , a prestigious cameraman who made ¨Fray Escoba¨, ¨La Mies Es Mucha¨, ¨Vida Por Delante¨, ¨Comicos¨ , and westerns as ¨Sheriff Terrible¨, ¨Vengador California¨ , ¨Bienvenido Padre Murray¨ . Evocative and atmospheric musical score by Daniel White . The motion picture was badly directed by Ramon Torrado . Ramon was born in 1905 , Galicia, Spain . He was a director and writer , known for directing some vehicles of known Folkloric stars such as Peret in Amor a Todo gas (1969) , Manolo Escobar in Un Beso en Puerto (1966) and Paquita Rico in Malvaloca (1954). The nice craftsman Torrado directed four mediocre Chorizo Westerns such as 1964 La Carga De la Policía Montada , 1964 Relevo a Pistolero and 1963 Bienvenido, Padre Murray and 1965 Los Cuatreros . Rating : 4/10.",
