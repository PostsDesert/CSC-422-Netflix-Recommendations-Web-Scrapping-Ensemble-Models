To do this, Yuzuha creates Mayuka genetically from a bit of Tenchi's hair and from her own hair. The arrival of Mayuka, who immediately calls Tenchi \"Daddy!\", causes a whole chain of events that are lots of fun to watch.\n\nThe reason for Yuzuha seeking revenge is told in flashbacks. Although an attempt is made to make Yuzuha appear evil, she actually comes across at times as rather cute, when not grimacing.",
