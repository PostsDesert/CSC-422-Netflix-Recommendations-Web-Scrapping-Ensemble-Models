The original Japanese with the subtitles are extremely funny, and as stated before not so funny with the English dub.\n\nI originally got the video because of the trailer I had seen on another video that I had rented at Blockbuster, I mean how can you pass up video that has trailer that starts with:\n\nThe heart-warming story of a Boy and his Cat...\n\n...and a major Military Equipment Manufacture\n\nand having watched Project A-ko, Dirty Pair, Ranma 1/2 et al, I know how entirely warped Japanese comedy can be, and this seriers is worth getting and watching.",
