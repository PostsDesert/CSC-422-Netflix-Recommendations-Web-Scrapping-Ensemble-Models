        "reviewBody": "Joyride (1995) \n\n*** 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nAn electrician (Christopher Fulford) gets done with a job and on the ride home he sees a body in the middle of the road. He stops to investigate when he's hit on the head by a second person. When he wakes up he's in the trunk of his car tied up and he must try to fight to stay alive.\n\nThis 10 minute short was directed by Jim Gillespie who would soon after wards find himself in Hollywood making movies including I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. This short got a lot of attention at various film festivals and for very good reasons because it's highly entertaining, incredibly creative and it manages to build up some wonderful suspense. There are so many fun twists in the story that I'm going to avoid mentioning a single one because it would really take away from those watching the film for the first time. Once the action gets to the trunk of the car there's a great amount of suspense as we see our hero struggle to do anything and there's no doubt that he has some of the worst luck imaginable. Gillespie shows an extremely strong directorial job and it's easy to see why this gained him so much attention."
