        "reviewBody": "I watched this 7-hour presentation last weekend on the History Channel and enjoyed it very much. I was always interested in history when I was in high school several years ago but this documentary (shown in seven 1-hour segments) was so much more interesting than trying to read it in text books.\n\nEvery President from George Washington to George W. Bush is profiled along with their wives (James Buchanan was the only bachelor). It talks about the political climate when each was elected along with the various wars from the revolutionary war to the gulf wars.\n\nThere is also a fascinating history of the White House included within the documentary. Since George Washington never lived in the White House it begins with John and Abigail Adams as the first residents. James and Dolly Madison were living there when the British set fire to it during the War of 1812. When electricity was installed years later in the late 1800s people were afraid to turn on the lights for fear of being shocked.\n\nHighly recommended to anyone interested in American history.",
