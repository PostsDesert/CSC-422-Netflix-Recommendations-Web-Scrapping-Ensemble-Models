I mean, yes..most people who saw this movie, probably thought it was horrible, I on the other hand, enjoyed it. It was a very different style of directing, acting, and screen play. Comm'on, who thinks up Vapoorise..thats gold! hahahaa..anyways, Ben Stiller (even though, he paid some of his own money so that the movie would not be put out) was funny as always, he kept his character through the whole thing. Even though i'm not too much of a Jack Black fan, he was pretty funny as well, he did go a bit overboard, but its jack black what can you do..heh..and you cant forget about the lovly Rachel Weisz..oh baby she's smoking! Expecially when she wants SEX ON A LAUNDRY MACHINE..and to save the best for last..the one and only Christopher Walken...well, he speaks for him self for a description. I also thought the story was very well done, all the problems that were faced between black and stiller were good...I like the whole \"I didn't do it\" lie, which grows into a big huge problem. I'm sorry i couldnt give you too much of a description of the movie, but its worth seeing if you have a ciniplex near you, where you pay like 7 bucks. I had some really good laughs, and all the characters worked well together. The End..or is it..DUN DUN DUN!!"
