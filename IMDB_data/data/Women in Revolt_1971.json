Paul Morrissey \"directs\" this ad libbed diatribe that owes a debt to Jackie Susann's VALLEY OF THE DOLLS as transvestites Candy Darling, Jackie Curtis, and Holly Woodlawn talk non-stop while going from dissatisfied society deb, teacher, and model to wallowing in the depths of despair after becoming P.I.G.s (Politically Involved Girls). The objectified males are merely peripheral and mostly naked but the Kim Novak-obsessed Candy is both funny and fascinating. It's a shame he/she died so young.",
