Where's the challenge in destroying presents and tormenting the citizens of Whoville? As for the graphics, don't get me started. The graphics are so bad that it makes you wonder if you're playing an Atari 2600 game. Playing the demo version of this game was enough for me. Stay away from this one and wait for the Jim Carrey film (which is much better) when released on video. My evaluation: 2.5 out of 10.",
