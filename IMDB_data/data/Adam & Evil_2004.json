ADAM (Aaron Paul) is a successful Mortgage Broker, but has a terrible accident that puts him in a wheel chair and thru months of grueling therapy both physical and emotional. A Very Dramatic Movie with Rich characters and Story that is both Inspiring and Heartfelt and a little Sad. Great Cast of Actors !! Lena Olin nails the Russian accent of her role. Tom Berenger plays Adam's Father . Filmed In Detroit MI and for some reason it took 8 years to be released ? Odd as this is a well put together production ! Funny at times too. ðŸ˜† on Amazon Prime.",
