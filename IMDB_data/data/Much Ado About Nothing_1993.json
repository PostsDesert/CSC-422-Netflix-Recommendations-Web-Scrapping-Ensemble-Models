        "reviewBody": "I love this movie! Great story, wonderful cast, good photography. Kenneth Branaugh is the funniest as a witty, likable guy. His facial expressions and vocal streachs are the best! I think he is one of the best Shakespearian actors of today. Emma Thompson is great. Denzel Washington very cool, I felt so sorry for him when Beatrice refused him, though he is a little too good for her. I love his character though, how he likes to fix everybody up and make them happy. Robert Sean Lenord was a little sappy, but it was pretty fitting for who he was. He needs more roles like this and Dead Poets Society. Micheal Keaton and his little side-kick (poor guy!) stole the show! Hilarious! Hero didn't do anything for me though. She was pretty, but didn't have much to say, it seemed like she was watching the others most of the time. The best part of this movie is when Benidick and Beatrice hear about the other's love and realise they love each other. The photography is best when Beatrice is swinging and Benedick is splashing in the fountain! I'm hooked on Shakespheare now, I'm planning to watch the version of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" coming out with Michelle Pfeiffer, not to mention any Shakespeare movies I see with Kenneth Branaugh in them!"
