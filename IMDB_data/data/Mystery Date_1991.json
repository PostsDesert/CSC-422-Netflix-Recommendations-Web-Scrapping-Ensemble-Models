It stars a young Ethan Hawke (Training Day) and a very attractive, younger Teri Polo (Meet The Parents). When Tom McHugh's (Hawke) older brother Craig (McNamara) sets Tom up with Gina (Polo) for a blind date everything for the beginning part, starts off well... until Tom finds himself chased throughout the night by cops, a psychotic flower deliver man (Stevens) and a mob Boss by the name of James Lew (Wong) - it seems everyone wants a piece of Tom... or is it Craig and why?... Watch and find out! A great date movie and one to watch when your in one of those \"I want to watch something, but i'm not sure what\" type of scenarios. Cheers.",
