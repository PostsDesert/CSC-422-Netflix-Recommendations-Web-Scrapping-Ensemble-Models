They all included the scene where the artist does it \"his own way\". Yawn. \"La Bamba\", however, is one that I like. I liked it when I saw it in the theater (MovieWorld, Douglaston, NY) and I really enjoyed today. The cast is excellent. They all do a terrific job. The story movie fast. Its payoff leaves not a dry eye in the house. \"La Bamba\" is one of the few music biographies that I enjoy revisiting.",
