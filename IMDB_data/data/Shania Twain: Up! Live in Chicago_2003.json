Her choice of songs also work well- she has slow songs, but not so many that it becomes boring....just enough for her and the audience to catch their breath. Also, she plays the guitar in a few songs, which is nice. She really puts everything she has into her songs...all her energy, emotion, and passion. She allows several people on the stage, and she is so friendly with all of them. Even 3 little girls...she allows the to sing \"I'm Gonna Getcha Good,\" with her. Shania is a very sweet person and it shows through in her performances.",
