        "reviewBody": "This tape (now DVD) features three of the most famous opera singers of their day. In this concert, they perform individually and collectively. At least two of these three, maybe all three, are considered by some as technically better singers than Andrea Bocelli, but I'll take the latter. I mention him because listening to him got me interested enough in watching this concert.\n\nIt's almost two hour hours of music so if you like these gentlemen, you certainly get your money's worth out of this tape (now disc). I found it somewhat boring, but I am not an opera fan and I take nothing away from the great talents of these singers. The lack of colorful or exciting visuals dampened my enthusiasm somewhat. It's just straight camera shots of the guys singing, nothing special to make you watch this. It's just as well being a CD where you can do something while you listen.\n\nFilmed in Los Angeles, two big stars were seated in the front row and the boys did a special number for each: \"My Way,\" for Frank Sintra, and \"Singin' In the Rain,\" for Gene Kelly. The latter didn't look good, sad to say, and died within two years of this taping. \n\nOverall, I would suggest to buy the CD instead.",
