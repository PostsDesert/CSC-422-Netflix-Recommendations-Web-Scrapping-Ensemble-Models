During this unforgettable evening, Grant fielded questions from an audience of over five hundred for nearly two hours.\n\nGrant seemed to possess a photographic memory, recalling incidents of his life and career down to the smallest detail. \"Father Goose\" was revealed to be one of his favorite projects.\n\nLooking at the film today, one can see the senior star enjoying his character and well polished script. He was nicely paired with Leslie Caron, and the two struck an engaging chemistry for these capers.\n\nGrant also had the good sense to say farewell to these leading man parts (being aware that he could never become a \"character\" actor) threw in the towel and moved on to better things, like Fabrege. \n\nWe're left with another delightful Grant performance in an illustrious and remarkably diversified career."
