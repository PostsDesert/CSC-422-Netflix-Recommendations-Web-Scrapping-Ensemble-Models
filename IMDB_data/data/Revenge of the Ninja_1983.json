        "reviewBody": "This was the first Sho Kosugi film I saw of his series and I have to say it spoiled me rotten.\n\nI wasn't too Impressed with the other films that he starred in, although I fully recognise his place in bringing about the ninja film boom in the 80's but most of his films seemed to be low budget nonsense with not much 'ninja' involved.\n\nNone of this applies in Revenge of the Ninja though. Cannon obviously gave the film enough money to look (for the time) reasonably glossy, and director Sam Firstenberg, while no James Cameron, does a great job with the so-so but not entirely awful story.\n\nThe movie has fleshed out fight scenes that occur pretty regularly within the film, keeping the obligatory acting parts to just enough and no more. The fights are respectably choreographed by Kosugi himself, and while they don't have the speed and flair of Hong Kong action films they stand up as strong, well thought out pieces of work that are enjoyable to watch.\n\nThe film greatly benefits from a really terrific bad guy. Arthur Roberts is good as the snake like pseudo-friend Braden, but is even better as the evil, and quite scary Braden-Ninja who disposes of his enemies in a number of imaginative, gruesome, and highly enjoyable ways.\n\nThere are inclusions of some traditional ninja weapons and tools in the film which is nice to see, although while a flame thrower is hardly traditional I'm sure if ancient ninja were alive today they would make use of modern technology to get the job done.\n\nProbably the most striking aspect of the film is that, for a movie made in 1983, it is particularly gory and violent for that time, with full views of shurikens embedded in heads and eyes, and arms being sliced off. It might not seem so harsh these days what with Stallone doing a great job of updating the 80's action hero with Rambo and The Expendables, but at that time it seems a lot of work went into the film, and the effort seems to have paid off so well done.\n\nRevenge of the Ninja is a great film for ninja fans, or even just something to watch with a few mates for the grisly deaths, and it definitely stands head and shoulders above the rest of the sub-par 80's ninja sludge.",
