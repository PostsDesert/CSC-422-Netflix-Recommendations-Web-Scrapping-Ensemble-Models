        "reviewBody": "If you are a fan of Plan 9 From Outerspace, Troma, Russ Meyer and Terry Gilliam then this is a must see. This is what Barbarella would look like if it would have been directed by Terry Gilliam with 2 dollar budget. Some of the humor reminded me a bit of Peter Jackson's Bad Taste, but don't get me wrong, this one isn't filled with blood, guts and brains. Pervirella is filled with intentional bizarre and obscure, bad humor throughout the whole movie. Made with very low budget that they aren't even trying to hide, but instead underlining it to get few laughs. \n\nI'm fairly confident that this is a movie that most will hate, but then again I'm sure that this is targeted to a very different and certain audience that loves low budget camp b-movies and movies by Ed Wood, Russ Meyer, Troma Entertainment & Monty Python.\n\nAnd of course, the great and humorous performance of the divine Emily Booth in the title role doesn't really hurt it either",
