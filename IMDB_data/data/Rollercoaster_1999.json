The realistic teen drama was enhanced by the dreamy music that floated thru the amusement park. I could never imagine climbing a roller-coaster, and this was really amazing to watch. I don't understand why Darrin jumped off the coaster. Was it because Chloe persuaded him to do it, or was it because she slept around and betrayed him?\n\nAnyway it was different, and enjoyable to view. Dark and depressing, but a lot of good movies are that. The character Sketch was really creative, and I was glad that Stick joined him on his mission to his sisters. \n\nDoes anyone know if the soundtrack is available anywhere?"
