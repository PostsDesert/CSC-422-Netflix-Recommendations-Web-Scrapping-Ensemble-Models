It combines the energy in their music with the energy of a live performance. Those live performance recordings where made during their 98-99 tour, after the release of their record \"Beaucoup fish\", which i think is their best album so far.\n\nThis isn't a DVD you should just sit down in the couch and watch. This is a live DVD. You should playing it a bigscreen on a party or something where you could dance. Because i couldn't sit down and watch it. And i think you wouldnt either",
