It had Joely Richardson (Nip/Tuck) and Hayden Panettierre who, at a very young age, has been in a lot of movies! I found myself into the characters pretty good. At first, I liked the mom but I didn't like the fact that she lied all the time. Later on in the movie, you really kind of hated the mom who turns on her daughter and ends up lying to her as well! This is one movie that I thought was going to be awful but actually ended up being decent enough to watch! If you like a good drama, watch this one!!",
