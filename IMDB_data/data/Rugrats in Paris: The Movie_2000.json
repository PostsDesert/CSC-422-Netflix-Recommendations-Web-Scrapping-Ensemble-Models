We've been watching Rugrats on TV for some time, and are quite familiar with the characters.\n\nHonestly, this was one of the better movies I've seen this season, bar none. There are ample parodies of other movies (to make the adults laugh-outright), as well as lots of fun for the little ones. The battle between Robo-Reptar and Robo-Snail kept my boys talking excitedly all the way home.\n\nIf you are not a fan of the Rugrats, this movie will do little to change that. However, this movie is considerably better than either the first Rugrats movie or any of the individual TV episodes. For once, a movie spawned from a TV series is actually better than the series.",
