It's always been my favorite movie.\n\nAll I can remember, and I don't know how many times I've seen it since, is that I cry when I do. I wouldn't have known who George C. Scott was, then, but he certainly adds to the drama.\n\nThis is a classic. This is about the United States, about the people of the world. This movie is a classic - eternal.\n\nI don't know that I understood, then, what was truly going on - that scientific discovery, technology - as precious and valuable as it is, was going to be corrupted to carry out an assassination plot.\n\nIt's almost eerily reminiscent of 9/11. But we didn't stop 9/11.\n\nMaybe what needs to change is the way we see the world, whether we're 6, or 86. This is a movie for all to see, especially children. This is a movie that will bring us together, and instruct us about the dangers of not only technology, but also the sometimes destructiveness of human nature."
