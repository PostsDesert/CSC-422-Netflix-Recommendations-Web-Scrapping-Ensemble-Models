        "reviewBody": "King of the Hill is a great Simpsons episode with a very well written storyline and plenty of very funny scenes. I like seeing episodes like this, where we see one of the characters being put in a position that we never thought we would and hilarity ensues, in this case we see Homer struggling to climb up a mountain, and to make matters more hilarious he must do it on a diet of power bars. I also enjoyed the guest roles of Brendan Fraser and Steven Weber, who were both quite unlikeable characters, but they both had very funny dialogue and I enjoyed their role. It's certainly not the highlight of the ninth season, but King of the Hill is still a very enjoyable Simpsons episode. \n\nAfter he starts going to the gym, Homer is spotted by an energy bar company who want him to climb a mountain as a promotion for their product.",
