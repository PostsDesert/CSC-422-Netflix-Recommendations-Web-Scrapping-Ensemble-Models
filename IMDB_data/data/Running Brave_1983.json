Billy Mills is a Native American Indian who has to fight against the odds to get to the top. A gifted athlete who is very proud of his heritage works his way to the top and wins the 10,000 metres at the Tokyo Olympics. It highlights the ups and downs an American Indian must face to get recognition as a man and athlete. Robbie Benson seems to be born for the part. He portrays Mills very well to the extent that the running style is very alike. The actual race brings a chill to your spine, especially the way he finishes down the straight. This is a great Movie and any budding athlete should watch it just to see how to become a winner and win against all the odds.",
