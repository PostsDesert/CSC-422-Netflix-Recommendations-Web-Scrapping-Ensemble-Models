The film dealt with a very emotional subject in a practical and logical way and brought to screen the misery caused to everyone concerned in this tragic conflict. All the major points were well handled, including references to false \"encounters\", the guilt of some Hindu friends of the Sikhs, the routine brutality of the police. There was also some balance in the film - not all police were the baddies, some were ordinary family men doing their jobs. Everyone had their frailties, even the hero wasn't a true film Hero, just a man caught up in a conflict not of his making\n\nExcellent, more please",
