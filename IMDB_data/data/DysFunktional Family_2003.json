I've seen a quite a few stand-up comedian shows at my age, but I must say... Eddie Griffin \"tickles the f!@$ outta me\" to use his own words. The movie is a small summary of his tragic life... growing up without a father, being raised by his mother and uncle Bucky. All of this would be true, if HE weren't the one making fun of it all, seeing things from an impersonal point of view... He pretty much talks about everything there is to talk about... 9-11 and the \"Osama MFers\", about sex, church, drugs, mother's unorthodox methods of raising him/spanking him... the thing is, the movie gets so hilarious at some point, I was beginning to wonder about how will I stop laughing after hearing so many jokes in such a short time... I sincerely recommend the movie to any person that understands English and the subtleties of the English language... I voted a 10 for the movie... amongst my favorites! \"Think! It Ain't Illegal Yet!\"",
