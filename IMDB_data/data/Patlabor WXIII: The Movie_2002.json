        "reviewBody": "\"Japanese cartoons are for kids\"...\n\nThis is yet another movie to show to people who wrongfully believe that!\n\nA movie like \"Ghost in The Shell\" and the series \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" have proven to contain more plot in the screenplay, and even afterthought in the mind of the audience, than most Hollywood-movies I know of. \"Patlabor 2\" is definitely another addition to my list of movies I would say disproves the first sentence in this comment.\n\nAs other commenters have noted, \"Patlabor 2\" resembles a Tom Clancy political thriller. The storytelling was so good that it got my heart racing in some scenes, and that is saying a lot from my point of view (Trust me on that one - I've seen \"The Others\" and similar movies, without moving a muscle when the rest of the theatre screamed).\n\nIf the story was tightened here, and the plot was elaborated there, \"Patlabor 2\" could be made into a Hollywood-movie as a frame-by-frame copy! I really mean that - There is always room for improvement, but in my opinion there are only very minor blemishes to the flow of the movie. I enjoyed every second, although some other commenters found the \"slow parts\" boring or irrelevant.\n\nThe music (or lack thereof) is also definitely worth a mention. It's hard to describe - I just couldn't imagine it being any different for this movie. The reason I write lack of music is because there are scenes where any Hollywood-producer would have slapped on some generic classical music, but in this case there is none. For example there is a scene after a climax where you just see different parts of the cityscape, with snow falling, and there is no sound at all. THAT's movie-magic. It's part of what draws me to this strange, exotic type of movies - it's so different than what most of us are used to.\n\nRecreate the visuals using a film-camera, actors and a special-effects crew, copy+paste the music, label it \"made in Hollywood\" and you've got yourself a blockbuster-hit!\n\nJapanese cartoons are for kids - not. If you have a brain, and an attention-span bigger than your average action-monkey, this movie is for you.",
