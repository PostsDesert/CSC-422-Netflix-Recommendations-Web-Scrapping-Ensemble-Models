So I thought, hey, this is okay, it's unlike any other anime. I like the part with the FBI agents, who are a spoof of the X-Files. The rocker Oji kinda looks like the teacher from El Hazard also. And the song is okay, and is sung by John Sykes, a famous rocker, once worked with Whitesnake. And, this is what I think. I think there was a bit of tribute to Michael Schenker, cause in 1999, UFO, the band he worked with did a concert in Tokyo, Japan, that is only my guess. Cause hey, they played Into The Arena in one of the episodes right? Anyways, watch this if you have nothing else to do, and if you're sick and tired of the anime that rips off Gundam and Pokemon."
