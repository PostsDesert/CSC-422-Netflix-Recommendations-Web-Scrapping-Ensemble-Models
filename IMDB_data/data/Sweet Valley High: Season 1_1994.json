All I can say is that this show is so terrible, but at the same time, it's incredibly awesome. I don't remember the acting being as bad as it is. Everything seems so forced and fake. Both the lines and the deliveries are laughable. All of the situations that occur are unbelievable. For example, in one episode, Elizabeth's longtime pen pal, who just happens to be a prince, comes to visit Sweet Valley. During his visit, he falls in love with Jessica. Amazing. I definitely recommend watching this if you're in the mood for something terrible."
