        "reviewBody": "Of all the non-\"Endless Summer\" films in the Bruce Brown Golden Years of Surf Collection, this one has always been my favorite. This is my third time to purchase this DVD (my previous two VHS copies were worn out from use at parties). It lacks everything a \"quality\" film requires - and yet it beats the mainstream by a mile. If you want to feel like you were there (Mazatlan or the North Shore) and you love vintage surf movies, this is it. Pure, honest, classic. This is a must for true soul surfers.\n\nOther movies in this collection include: Slippery When Wet, Barefoot Adventure, Surfing Hollow Days, Waterlogged, Surfin' Shorts and (of course) The Endless Summer.",
