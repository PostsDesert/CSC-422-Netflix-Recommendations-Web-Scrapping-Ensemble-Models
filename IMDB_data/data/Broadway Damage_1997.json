Mara Hobel is very funny as the fag hag friend and the movie is light and comical as it explores the characters lives and loves. Seeing the film in a packed house of gay men in Manhattan made it clear that the filmmaker was pretty on target as the audience laughed with recognition through most of the film. A very fun movie!"
