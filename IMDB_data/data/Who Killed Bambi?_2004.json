        "reviewBody": "This hilarious as well as wild picture is loaded with noisy action , irony , slapdash , comedy with tongue-in-cheek , bad taste jokes , rapid flash thrilling choreography , funny situations and with a distinctly Spanish sense of humor . The story of a wealthy man (Pedro Maria Sanchez) , his daughter Paula (Úrsula Corbero) , her boyfriend David (Quim Gutiérrez) goes wrong when the rich person suffers a stroke and David along with his colleague Mudo (Julian Villagrán) attempt to hide the body . Meanwhile , three partners Edu (Ernesto Altero) , his girlfriend (Clara Lago) and Gaby (Enrico Vecchi) attempt to kidnap a manager with unexpected consequences . This is the starting point of a chase carried out by the four guys along with a mad lawyer ; all of them got themselves into a series of unfortunate twists and turns to finally answer the question ; Who killed Bambi? . Everything that you can imagine is far from the stupid things that may happen to these guys . As they get mix in wild party , kidnapping , murders , nutty events and many other things ; nothing more than a series of coincidences and twists of fate . Nothing should be taken at face-value; nothing should be taken seriously . \n\nThis is a fast crazy movie with lot of fun situations , antics , bemusement and with a bunch of very hilarious roles . \"? Quien Mato a Bambi ¿\" is a savage hybrid among the best \"Alex De la Iglesia\", ¨Airbag's Juanma Bajo Ulloa¨ and films about ¨wild parties¨ , topped with a little bit of original touches here and there ; including frenetic car pursuits . Sitting in a strange middle ground between the completely absurd and the stylishly cool, this one is one of a hundred and one movies to try and capture the vibe of America's Tarantino or Spain's Alex De La Iglesia. It turns out to be pleasantly fun that offers no intellectual stimulus whatsoever ; an exercise in pure amusement in which entertainment and fun are guaranteed . The characters are quite odd , grotesque and weird and the film races on at incredible speed . Higlights of this film include spectacular car crashes , and an impressive irruption of an automobile at a football camp . On the surface, ¿Quién mató a Bambi? doesn't get much wrong , it looks okay, the comedy misunderstandings pile up in a reasonably amusing fashion and the performance is passable . Some violence , tortures , finger-slitting , and profanities crop up often enough to help the film zip along throughout the half an hour runtime .There are also some funny cameos, some appear only for a minute such as Jose Angel Egido , Pedro Mari Sánchez , Carmina Barrios and Futbolista Andrés Iniesta at a funny special appearance . \n\nColorful and appropriate cinematography by Alex Catalan , a good cameraman who has photographed a lot of successful films such as ¨Even the rain¨ , ¨Grupo 7¨, ¨Habitacion En Roma¨ , ¨Cabeza De Perro¨ and ¨Voz Dormida¨. The motion picture was written , produced , directed and musicalized by Santi Amodeo . Santi directs with a bit of flair here and there but not enough to raise up the material . This is his last film , he had previously directed ¨El Factor Pilgrim¨ , ¨Astronautas¨ and ¨Cabeza De Perro¨ at his best . ? Quien mató a Bambi ¿ will pass the time, and I'm sure that one or two people may grow to love it, but it's one that I'll never seek out to re-watch again .",
