I like how they bring slaters character, in focus with the camera, you didnt see that too much back then, you see it now a days like on, Malcom in the middle on FOX as an example. This movie is one of my favorites, I am very suprised as why many people didnt care for you it but I cam to a conclusion that they probably had their eyes closed and were deaf. This movie has the most funny one liners, and humor I have ever seen. Like when slater buys the turkey for his brother and then the truck ran it over. Another great part was when he was in the car with Ted (another cop), and he started swearing, and then slater said, \"you have an unlimited vocabulary Ted\", and then Ted says the F- word back to him. Watch this movie and then thank me later. ***/ out of/ ****. A must see"
