Kenny G was playing as it was shown and he got most of the camera time...as a special effects fan I was highly disappointed at the directors choice and felt compelled to say something even if it is 12 yrs later. But the rest of the show was really well done especially the Frasier gag they put on before the Kenny G thing. As I am watching this on the Bio channel there is a horrible take on John Lennon's \"Imagine\" song done in a opera style...it's horrible. Well that does it for me, I'm changing the channel after I write this but I just saw Buzz Aldrin is coming on next so maybe I'll give it another shot."
