        "reviewBody": "The movie should be seen chiefly for its main actress, the beautiful and talented Pilar L贸pez de Ayala. She does the absolute best with what the script gives her. \n\nThis should be an entertaining and engrossing film, especially for those interested in Renaissance Europe, but it may be taking just too many liberties with the historical facts. It is highly doubtful that the real Juana became \"mad\" chiefly out of love for an unfaithful husband, who in this movie is not shown to be particularly interesting anyway. And if the real Juana was anywhere near as beautiful as the actress who plays her, I suppose the real Philip would not have been such a mean husband to her. \n\n Aside from her husband, her father King Fernando of Arag贸n and most of the Castilian nobles are not depicted too favorably either. \n\n Still, this movie is a good movie if you like costume drama, especially one with a southern European more than an English background.",
