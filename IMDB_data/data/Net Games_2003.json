        "reviewBody": "Now then folks, I enjoyed this film and have a feeling that it has never been available on a proper release in the U.K. I acquired an American import just recently and having watched it, cannot understand why it hasn't been available here. It is true to say that some of the reviews do speak very favourably and, in many instances, I can understand that. Granted, some of the acting is appalling.....particularly Lala Sloatman and Monique Demers. It is of no wonder that Ms Demers CV is not very long. However, I feel that the story, in the main, has been well thought out, with plenty of red herrings to keep you guessing. Sure, the unveiling of the protagonist was a bit disappointing and the sudden transformation from meek housewife to Rambo was a bit over the top, but remember, this film was made in 2003 and if things like this could have happened on the internet then, just imagine who could be watching you now!! Anybody!! You could say that this film was a very big warning of things to come. C Thomas Howell is an extremely accomplished actor and turns in a pretty good performance, as does Sam Ball, and Maeve Quinlan is good fun as the detective. All in all, I thought this to be a good, watchable movie. A little over the top at times sure, but still pretty enjoyable.",
