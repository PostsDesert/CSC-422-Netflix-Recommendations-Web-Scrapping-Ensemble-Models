        "reviewBody": "A widowed teacher and son travel to Siam, where she takes a job as governess to The King's children, after a troubled start, the pair develop an unexpected friendship.\n\nIt's not for everyone, and it's a film that would probably never be made in this day an age, but it was a huge success when it launched, and it's still loved and well regarded today. It's a lavish musical, with a pretty terrific cast, it's both engaging and amusing.\n\nDon't come here for a history lesson or an accurate portrayal of the culture, come here for two hours of escape. It's hard not to get lost in The King and I. The cultural clashes are something to behold, The King's brashness contrasted with the sheer English desire for properness, quite lovely.\n\nThe costumes and sets are divine, in terms of production values, this 1950's classic is off the scale, it truly does look sublime, it's a huge production, I'm not sure there's anything as attractive as Yul Brynner here though, his appearance is other worldly, his presence, his posture, harsh but incredible. Personally I think Brynner provides a masterclass here, he's phenomenal, when you watch this film, it's him you're watching.\n\nDeborah Kerr, a fine actress, she fitted the bill perfectly, her character is so prim and proper, the definitively English Governess, but she has a twinkle in her eye, a strong reserve, but a sense of humour and confidence. She could have easily made off with a grand piano under that crinoline.\n\nThe music is wonderfully memorable, it's memorable, it's prominent throughout, you'll not be able to watch, and not sing a couple of phrases.\n\nFavourite scene, Shall we dance, it's the highlight of the film for me, magical.\n\nIt's simply not Christmas without The King and I.\n\n8/10.",
