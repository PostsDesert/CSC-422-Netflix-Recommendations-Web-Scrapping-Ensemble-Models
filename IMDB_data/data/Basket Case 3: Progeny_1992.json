This third and last installment in the series has more gore than BC2, is campier and more entertaining than BC2, has some memorable characters and lovable cops, and you get to see 12 of Belial's kids, or his \"progeny\"....It's also got an ending to remember. Highly recommended, this flick rests easy in my collection. 9/10\n\nRated 18s for strong horror violence and gore, language, sensuality and nudity"
