Failing miserably the first time around, he learns to fight, shoot, and survive from mountain man Burt Reynolds and notorious bandit Ernie Hudson, before taking on Coburn a second time.\n\nWinning performances by the endlessly glib Sinbad and scene-stealers Reynolds and A. Martinez, along with some genuinely funny moments and some good action, make for a truly entertaining movie that surprisingly has a lot to say about friendship and loyalty.\n\nThe great all-star cast also includes Gregory Hines and Hal Williams. There's great chemistry at work here. Also, look fast for old-time black cowboy star Herb Jeffries in a non-speaking background role.\n\nI really wish HBO Films were still making good movies like this!",
