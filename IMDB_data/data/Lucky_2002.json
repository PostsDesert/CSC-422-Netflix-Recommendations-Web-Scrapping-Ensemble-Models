It would be unimaginable to mention her name in the same breath as the likes of classic mystery authors such as Christie or Le Carre. Having said that, this film really takes the biscuit. It is filmed like an Australian/American soap opera with the 'actors' responding to anything that happens or is said to them with a gasp, a sigh and a long look into the distance before delivering a dry and unbelievable reply. The 'star' is the same actress that rose to a short lived part in the UK soap opera Emmerdale...and she was actually more believable in that. I warn you... if you have some paint to watch dry... do that. My girlfriend described it as 'Days of our lives', with less talent than the cast of Friends."
