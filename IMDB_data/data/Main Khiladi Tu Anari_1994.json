Kader Khan's double role is so hilarious. Shakti Kapoor as Goli, the Underworld Don kills Arjun Joglekar, Karan's brother. Shivangi as portrayed by Raageshwari, has the hots for Deepak Kumar. I love Deepak Kumar's disguises. Johnny Lever as Dhansukh, Deepak's servant is a real trip. I highly recommend this film. Goli's thugs decide to rob an amusement park as they call it \"Disney World\". Raageshwari is so cute and adorable. My brother loves this film too, as well as my aunt and cousin sister. This film is a doozy.",
