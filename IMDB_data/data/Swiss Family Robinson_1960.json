        "reviewBody": "I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release when I was 6 years old and of course immediately loved it and have seen it several times over the years. It's one of those family classics that even though it's dated it seems to live on forever entertaining new generations. A great live-action film from the Disney studios. When many years after I first saw this movie, I first visited Disneyland in 1984, the first thing I wanted to see was the Swiss Family Treehouse exhibit. The attraction had lost it's luster and I was the inly one visiting it. They've since turned it into Tarzan's tree house from what I understand. The movie doesn't lose it's luster and the tree house is the film's central attraction. It does seem a little unbelievable that a family who could construct such a fantastic structure why couldn't they use those same skills to repair their ship wreck or build a new ship to take them away from the island? This is beautifully photographed by cinematographer Harry Waxman, John Howell is the production designer and Jack Stephens is the set decorator. Ken Annakin who directed several adventure films is the director. Lowell S. Hawley who was one of the writers on Disney's Zoro TV series wrote the screenplay in his adaptation of the Johann David Wyss novel. John Mills and Dorothy McGuire play the parents and James McArthur, Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran are their sons in the story of a family shipwrecked on a remote island with dangerous animals and the threat of bloodthirsty pirates in the waters. Janet Munro, Sessue Hayakawa and Cecil Parker round out the cast. I would give this an 8.5 out of 10.",
