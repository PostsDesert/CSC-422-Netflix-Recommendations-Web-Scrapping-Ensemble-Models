Recently rewatched this with my boyfriend who had never seen it, and it was still very enjoyable. It feels effortlessly funny, and not in a way like most \"teen comedies\" where it uses only bodily functions and sex to do so. Kutcher and Murphy seem to have a natural chemistry that was great for the film, and they're both in their element in this one. It's not going to be the best movie you've ever seen, and it's not meant to be. I wanted to give it a bit higher of a rating, I'd usually go with 7, just BECAUSE my boyfriend liked it because he almost never likes these movies. Definitely worth a watch.",
