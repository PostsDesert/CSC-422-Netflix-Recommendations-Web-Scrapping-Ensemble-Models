But when I kept watching, I realised I was wrong, although I have to admit that the first half an hour is rather comedy than drama.\n\nAnyway, \"Moonlight Mile\" is highly enjoyable. What exactly makes this movie so great? It's the acting. The cast is outstanding. Susan Sarandon and Dustin Hoffman are truly amazing as always. Jake Gyllenhaal, who we know from \"Donnie Darko\", was excellent as well. But, like I already said, Hoffman and Sarandon are the true stars in this one. They were both so funny from time to time! \"Moonlight Mile\" is definitely worth watching! A true indie with great performances!\n\n8/10",
