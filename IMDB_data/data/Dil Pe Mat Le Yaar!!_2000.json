        "reviewBody": "While the film eventually picked up speed, the characters were all a little annoying for the first hour of the film. I will have to admit, though, that Manoj Bajpal was excellent in his role and was convincing in every change in his character. The film was hurt by overacting on most of the characters part except for Tabu, who is always excellent. Some of the fight scenes were just too fakey and a little extra work could have paid huge dividends. I would have loved to have seen the nightclub scene without the fight sequences. It is the best song/dance in the movie.\n\nIf you purchase the DVD, be forewarned that the cover and back art gives a completely inaccurate picture of the film which, instead of beeing cheerful and upbeat, is very dark and, at times, depressing. At least the synopsis did not give everything away like so many of the ones on the DVDs.",
