Take for example the line \"Hey desperado, you've gotta come to your senses!\" You especially have to love the Boyz in the Sink Bellybutton song, a delightful farce on the recent trend of boy bands, with various veggie characters portraying a few of the familiar boy band faces. Even after hearing The Ballad of Little Joe a few times a day for the last month, being that it captivates my little toddler, I still love it just as much. Consider it highly recommended from a huge fan of veggietales.",
