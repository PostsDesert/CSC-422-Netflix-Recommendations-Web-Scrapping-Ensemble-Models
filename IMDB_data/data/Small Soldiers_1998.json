        "reviewBody": "I know the summary doesn't have anything to do with this comment, but I thought it would be funny to start this review. \"Small Soldiers\", believe it or not, it's more valuable that it appears to be. Yes, it may be a flawed movie, but considering that it is a movie born in the heart of Hollywood studios and intended for small audiences (and not so small), \"Small Soldiers\" takes his chances to create successfully a political satire, a very dark one.\n\nJoe Dante (a very underrated director) is a specialist in filtrating that kind of political message. And that's no wonder why decided to direct this movie. The best of all is that also works as a family flick, where the characters are likable enough to care about and it's really entertaining.\n\nAnyway, I really like it.",
