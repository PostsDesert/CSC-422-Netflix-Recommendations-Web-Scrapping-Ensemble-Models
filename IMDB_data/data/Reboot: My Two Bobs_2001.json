        "reviewBody": "Well, I've seen this wonderful second segment of Reboot's comeback on Cartoon Network, which is airing as the 4th Season of Reboot. This version of Reboot, seems to be a return or revisiting of old style humor that show was known for when it started up on ABC. However, some folks who come to know the series have become fond of it for its Action/Adventure theme from its Second/Third seasons. I think if no one has been seen the first part of the 4th season *Daemon Raising*, they will be utterly confused on what is going on, and possibly find it boring due lack of action in first few episodes. However by mid segment it picks up quite nicely. This segment is more about hidden agendas and trying figure out what is big mystery. Its going all nice and suddenly it comes with a left hook of surprise. There something to be said about good writers hard to find these days. Seems there a lot in Canada! This is an excellent show, I think everyone should try the watching entire series and watch it evolve."
