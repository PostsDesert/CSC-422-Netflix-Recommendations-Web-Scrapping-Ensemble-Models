        "reviewBody": "For the most part the animation is hands down some of the best hand to hand combat I've ever seen. However there are parts when the majority of the body or whatever is moving will drop out of the frame in order for them to show a close up on something else, leaving you with only the slightest clue as to what is currently happening. But the most unforgivable part is the handling of the narrative. The first half of episode one demonstrated a remarkable ability to expand bare bones writing into original and extensively detailed scenes. However there was also a pattern of condensing the more detailed parts of the original story into barely comprehensible, hyper-condensed scenes with next to no incite into the characters. The exposition as to how the characters arrived at their current states takes the form of single sentences mentioned in passing. This may be a consequence for the short episode count.",
