        "reviewBody": "TEXAS is a raw, honest documentary with behind the scenes footage of a band on location to make a CD. Russell Crowe is a serious musician. He and Dean Cochran have been best mates since their teen years and have experienced the down side of trying to make it in the music business.\n\nThis film shows the band traveling to London, Italy and Austin Texas with some clips of Russell and Dean's early years. It's funny, raunchy (as people who have worked hard and are jet lagged frequently become)and very full of soul touching music. You will go on a journey that will give you a real insight to how difficult it is to produce music and put on a live show. You will see a portion of the sold out Austin, Texas performance that will make you wish you were there.\n\nI loved this DVD and I hate cursing. But, the bad language is not done for shock effect, it is just how these guys interact.\n\nThere are surprises on the DVD that you have to dig deep to find but they are definitely worth the effort. Some of my friends who considered TOFOG a vanity project of Russell's are die-hard fans of the band since watching the DVD.\n\nThese are first class musicians who are not only a band but true friends that enjoy making music and are determined to give 100% to ensure their fans are entertained.\n\nI highly recommend the DVD.",
