I can't believe it, it is still so good! I particularly enjoyed a sort of pathos of Sheila Ramani and putting on a happy front. I also loved all her songs. I wish to correct a commentator, it is a movie of 50's not 60's (I should know it).\n\nIt is true Dev Anand, his wife in real life Kalpana Kartik, the songs of Talat etc are all excellent. Chetan Anand was at his best. I particularly loved the Guest Actor being Bombay City.\n\nIt is such a simple story and so well narrated without any extra stuff. Even the somewhat superfluous sister-in-law episode was funny and not too out of place. All in all I am so glad I bought the DVD. I recommend this movie to my age group as well as young crowd.",

One day, while assisting another taxi driver, Mangal comes to the assistance of a damsel in distress who is being molested by two thugs. Mangal gallants rescues her and attempts to take her to her destination, to no avail, as the person she is looking for has moved. The next day, Mangal and the young woman, Mala, again attempt to seek Ratanlal, a music director, but the entire day is spent in vain. Mala lives in Mangal's tiny apartment and both become attracted to each other. When Mala finds out about Sylvie, she leaves him. He goes in her search, but finds that she has become a famous singer with the help of her music director friend. Will Mangal ever get a chance to tell about his love for Mala? What will Sylvie's reaction be?",
