Performances alternately understated and overstated. Not only is comedy personal, but the appeal of various comics changes over time (Bob Hope isn't popular with people under 40, Laurel and Hardy endure). This comedy may have long legs. Note that many IMDB comments are current as people give it another look 15 years later."
