        "reviewBody": "This video treatment of John Nash's story is compelling and fascinating, and that would be enough by itself, but what makes it so much more interesting is how different it is from the story told in A Beautiful Mind. The differences are often so marked, that the story told in this film is overshadowed by them. Now I am not sure what to believe: was there a nonexistent roommate named Paul Betanny or is he a figment of a screenwriter's dementia? In this telling, there weren't even voices until after a second institutionalization. The game of \"go\" in the Howard film was, in what may be actual fact, a game using \"go\" pieces that was referred to as \"Nash\" at Princeton, and one can easily guess who actually was master of that game. It's understandable that folks would want to present a tidy story with development and all the other elements that we like in a film, but the story presented in A Brilliant Madness, while not quite so flashy in the hallucination area, is much more interesting, and the human dynamics presented are more complex and finally more believable. An hour well-spent, this.",
