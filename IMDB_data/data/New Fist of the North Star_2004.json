Everything seems made to be a mere marketing operation. The 3D scenes don't always match correctly with 2D, the animation is not so good, the plot is a bit boring and the new voice of Kenshiro is much worse than the original one by Akira Kamiya. And, the last but not the least, what's that horrible part of a samurai armor in Kenshiro's right shoulder? That's crap I say!",
