Writer/director E. Max Frye deserved much better reception for this sharp, smart piece of work. Unfortunately, the film's ending was apparently re-worked, to the satisfaction of almost no one on the creative team.\n\nCoincidentally, the angry mob torch scene in this movie was shot practically the same time the 'Rodney King' riots unfolded 3000 miles away in LA.",
