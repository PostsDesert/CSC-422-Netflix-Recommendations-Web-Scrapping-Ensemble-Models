        "reviewBody": "This is a hard kicking, hard punching fight fest that seems to be becoming something of a cult hit amongst genre fans. What the film lacks in frugality it more than makes up for with it's bone crunching fight scenes. This really is an action lovers film. it's simple entertainment and enjoyably violent.\n\nThe films plot involving a kick-boxing and amnesiac Christian is at times perfunctory for this type of movie. However Steven Bauer, as the Pit-Fighters manager and friend does a very good job in keeping a sense of humanity in the film, while leading man Dominique Vandenberg does reasonably well, as far as kick boxers turned actors go. However when it comes down to the nitty-gritty of kicking ass, Vandenberg looks at home. Director Jesse Johnson, whose previous effort The Honourable, proved as popular amongst action junkies (those who saw it) has a good understanding of style. He shoots the film nicely and it has an interesting and unique look. There's a hint of that Erin Brockovich, Traffic type colour pallet that Soderbergh used and the film almost looks documentary at times. There are times when this film looks really good and there are interesting choices in editing. The fights in particular get right into the face of the action. You feel every crack and crunch of sinew, every tear of cartilage. It's gloriously violent at times and nicely stylish. it's a far cry from the showy antics of Mr Van Damme's similar themed films. The film also features a nice low key and at time's interesting score.\n\nOverall this is a highly polished and enjoyable piece of action cinema, considering it's measly $600,000 budget and while it's been there done that, with an end action scene that borders ludicrous, it gets by on some of the most wince-worthy fight sequences for sometime. ***",
