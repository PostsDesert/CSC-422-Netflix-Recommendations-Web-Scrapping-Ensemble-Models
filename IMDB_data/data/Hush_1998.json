        "reviewBody": "I agree with several other reviewers that this movie is underrated here.\n\nIt keeps your interest, especially if you like horses, and the contrast between hectic, noisy, frustrating, randomly violent, dirty, inhumane city life and the clean air and soothing charms of the \"simple life\" in the country (which now costs much more than most of us can afford).\n\nI think both Jessica Lange and Gweneth Paltrow handled their roles with aplomb. Anyone who's seen Lange in \"Blue Sky\" with Tommy Lee Jones will not be a bit surprised at her ability to successfully carry off a full-on lunatic.\n\nI think people may be a little put off by the happy ending from a lower budget, non-mainstream film, but what do I know?\n\nWell, I know I liked it more than it's rated on here, and I'd recommend it to friends. A masterpiece, it isn't, but I'd consider it entertaining and worthy of your time if you like mystery/thrillers set mostly in beautiful country surroundings with good acting.",
