        "reviewBody": "Free-spirit, fast-talking Casey Meadows (Deborah Foreman) works as a lowly dishwasher. She receives a letter from wealthy benefactor Witherspoon (E.G. Marshall) hiring her as a new driver for Brentwood Limousine. Supervisor McBride (Howard Hesseman) is horrified by the change in the stuffy all-male operation. Ruthless business Battle (Sam J. Jones) is one of her clients and he gets dumped by his girlfriend.\n\nThis is a fun 80's flick. Deborah Foreman was an 80's IT girl. She is adorable doing this wide-eyed, open-hearted character. Penn and Teller do a memorable hustler and Arab sheikh combo. The drawback is mainly Sam Jones. He's not a good enough actor to dig deeper into his character but he's mostly fine. He needs to be a romantic lead but he's more of a linebacker or a villain henchman. The writing is passable for an 80's comedy. The material is elevated whenever Foreman gets to deliver a fun line.",
