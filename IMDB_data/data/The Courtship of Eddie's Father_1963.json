I always find Glenn Ford to be a tru pro, and was happy to see Stella Stevens in it.I think she starred in Girls Girls Girls around the same period.I used to have a huge poster of her and Elvis on my wall when I was a kid(from Girls Girls Girls). I prefer this kind of movie to many on the screen today. At least men and women drressed well then."
