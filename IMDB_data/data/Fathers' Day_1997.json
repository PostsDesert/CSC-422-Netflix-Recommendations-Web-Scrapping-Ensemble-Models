Man was I wrong, it had a few funny parts to it but it could've been a lot better than what it was. Robin Williams acts too kiddy-like and didn't even make me laugh none the whole movie (That's a first for Robin Williams movies). I think Billy Crystal did a good job playing it as a straight business man but why did they rate this movie as a comedy??? The funniest part of the movie was by an actor that nobody even knows. The part where the boy's real father gets stuck in the outhouse. This is not a terrible movie but it's not all that great either. ** of 4"
