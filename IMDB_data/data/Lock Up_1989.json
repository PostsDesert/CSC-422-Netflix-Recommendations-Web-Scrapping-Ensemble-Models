        "reviewBody": "Lock Up I feel is one of Stallone's better movie's. The storyline seems to fit the acting character of Stallone very well. Sutherland's depiction as the Warden \"Drumgroole\" also was excellent. As always, Stallone seems to epitomize struggle in movies very well. In the movie Stallone is a convict just trying to ride his time out, but the warden makes it very hard on him. John Amos also depicts the caring but hard as nails Prison guard \"Micon\" very well. In my opinion Lock Up is a Top Level Stallone film, and didn't get nearly the credit it deserved. I certainly would recommend this film. One word that can describe this film would be \"EMOTIONAL\" If you like a tough, gritty prison movie, then you will certainly like Lockup."
