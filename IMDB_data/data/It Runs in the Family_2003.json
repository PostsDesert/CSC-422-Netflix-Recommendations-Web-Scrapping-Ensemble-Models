For a first time actor, Cameron Douglas did very well. Not surprising when you see how well the other actual family members do in their chosen field! It is about the normal dysfunctual family and then some. There is laughter, tears and it makes you think. I recommend it highly and feel sorry for those who just did not get the movie. It only made 8 million I heard. Pitty those who do no get to see it!"
