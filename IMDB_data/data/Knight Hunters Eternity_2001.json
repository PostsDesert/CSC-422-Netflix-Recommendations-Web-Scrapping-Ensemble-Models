        "reviewBody": "Four handsome young men work in a flower shop by day. By night, they are the elite team of assassins known as Weiß (pronounced vice), lead by a mysterious person known only as Persia, and dedicated to 'deny the beasts of evil their tomorrows'.\n\nWhile not the best anime ever, Weiss is quite an entertaining show. Dark pasts, comic relief, guns, knives, swords, and the ever-wonderful bishonen (pretty boys). The story is original the music is very good, and the animation is pretty nice. But the best part is the voice acting. If you're a fan of Jamie McGonnigal or Paul Juhn, you'll be in heaven. If you prefer Japanese voice actors (or seiyuu), the cast is packed with stars, including Koyasu Takehito (Zechs Merquise of Mobile Suit Gundam W), Shinichirou Miki (Katan of Angel Sanctuary), Midorikawa Hikaru (Hide of 3x3 Eyes) and Ryoutarou Okiayu (Watanabe of Excel Saga).\n\nI give this series a 8/10 in Japanese and subtitles, and a 7/10 in English dubs. It's probably more of a 'girl' anime, but the action sequences will get the guys to hang around."
