        "reviewBody": "I thoroughly enjoyed this documentory. Although the principal characters had all the best intentions, they lacked any inteligence, thus, producing one of the funniest \"fly on the wall\" sagas I have seen. A teenage girl, programmed by her local church, sounds off about lesbians coming into the store, or diner where she works. The poor girl is reminiscent of a stepford daughter. How can she possibly make such an invalid, hateful remark when this child probably has never left her fold or been further than the church gates?. GROW UP!! Open your eyes. I chose to look upon the church folk with humour. Indeed, they strongly believe in their cause, but COME ON!!!! Youve got to be kidding. The zeal in which the kids, and the sweaty creepy father compete for places in the \"horror\" show, is in fact a Horror show in itself. I wonder if trying to conjure up so much hatred and fear is , or was Christs intention. I bet if he watched this movie He would indeed want to come and fetch his brides, (with a gun to His head perhaps). People prove to be scarey, and sweet ignorance takes hold of this grotesque flock. Laughable? yes, but then the reality that these people can manifest fear and loathing into a new batch of kids is HORRIFIC. Heavens forbid a gay child being raised in that community....... It may make you fat and sweaty, and wear skin hugging black lycra T shirts......YIKES!"
