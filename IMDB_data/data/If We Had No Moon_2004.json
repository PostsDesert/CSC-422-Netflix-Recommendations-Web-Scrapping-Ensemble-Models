        "reviewBody": "Oddly enough, the program \"If We Had No Moon\" only deals with that question for about 15 seconds...If we had no moon, we wouldn't be here. Alrighty then, no further explanation, no debate as to what would be here. Just asked and answered. We wouldn't be here.\n\nThe rest of the program is pretty much dedicated to forwarding theories on how the moon was formed, the importance of the earth moon system, and how we'll be able to explore the moon in years to come. Very cool effects made the theories come to life.\n\nEven better was the method by which the featured scientists carefully picked which laws to overlook to fit their hypotheses (entropy, anyone), stated these hypotheses as facts, then built theories based on those \"facts.\" Earth Mach One? C'mon now.\n\nAll in all the show was well produced, smartly narrated, and thought provoking, although ultimately I'd recommend more thought and less provoking. \n\nI would've liked to see the graphic artists rendering of what it would be like on earth if we in fact had no moon, but that never did happen.",
