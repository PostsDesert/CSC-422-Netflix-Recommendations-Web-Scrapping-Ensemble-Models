        "reviewBody": "This movie is a lighthearted romp! It is filled with laughs, some brilliant physical humor (who knew John Landis was a comic-action actor?), sudden surprises and a phenomenal cast.\n\nAnd, as a little teaser to make you rent the theatrical version, Michelle Pfeiffer's only known nude scene! TSK, TSK, where she hid those gems!\n\nJeff Goldblum gives a deadpan performance that is perfect. It fits this movie, it fits his style, and at times it is just hilarious. Probably his best role ever.\n\nThe amazingly diverse cast includes Dan Aykroyd, David Bowie, Jim Henson, Paul Bartel, Carl Perkins, Bruce McGill (as Elvis!), Irene Papas, Vera Miles, Richard Farnsworth, Kathryn Harrold, Jake Steinfeld (Body By Jake) and even Clu Gulager! WOW!\n\nBut there's added richness for the film buff. Landis cast no fewer than 15 Hollywood directors in this film, plus himself! You can spot Lawrence Kasdan, Jonathan Demme, Paul Mazurski, Amy Heckerling, David Cronenberg, Roger Vadim, Jonathan Lynn, Jack Arnold, Don Siegel, Andrew Marton, Richard Franklin, Colin Higgins, Jonathan Kaufer and Carl Gottlieb.\n\nDirector Daniel Petrie even plays the director of a film-within-the-film, with the assistant director of this film, David Sosna, playing the assistant director of that film. There are cinematographers, writers and make-up artists, too, including Rick Baker, the first make-up artist ever to win an Oscar for his craft.\n\nToo few people know about this sleeper. It's fast paced, funny and beautifully filmed. Rent it. You'll love it.",
