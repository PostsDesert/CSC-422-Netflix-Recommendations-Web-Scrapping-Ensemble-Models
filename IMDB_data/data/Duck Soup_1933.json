The Lemonade Stand & the Mirror Scenes also memorable. I hadn't seen the movie in around 15 years but bought the DVD so my 15 year old son could experience the Marxes. He loved it too.\n\nWhat I noticed for the first time was the satire of society, manners, government, the military, the bureaucracy (including Roberts Rules of Order). I can't recall any other comedy I've seen that satirizes on such a grand scale.\n\nFor Marx Brothers fans this is a must see. It's the boys with no love story or musical interludes in the way.\n\nOne word for those who disagree- \"Upstart\". :-)",
