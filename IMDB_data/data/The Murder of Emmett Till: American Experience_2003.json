This is a straight-forward no nonsense account that just tells the story the way it happened according to the killers themselves(because of the account they sold to a magazine) and the victims(the entire black race). It's amazing that this story is just now turned into a documentary for the whole world to see when it's obvious that this had a major impact on black society and their outrage that started the civil rights movement. The more it's watched the more disturbing it is which is why I consider this a well done documentary.",
