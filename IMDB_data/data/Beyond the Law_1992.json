I honestly don't know what the point of this film is. All Seagal does is sit in poorly lit rooms (with sunglasses) and whisper incomprehensively whilst smoking fat cigars, oh and he puts on a weird Southern accent too. His total screentime whilst standing up adds up to less than a minute, including a 15 second fight scene and a hilariously bad shooting scene. I don't know if he's trying to hide his obvious weight gain, lacking the energy to stand or just being lazy, but at this point Seagal isn't even 'bad in a funny way' to watch. At least Kill Switch was genuinly hilarious to watch.\n\nEverything else about this film is just generic and forgettable, there is nothing here you haven't seen before in better movies.",
