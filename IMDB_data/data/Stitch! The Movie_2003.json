Ten minutes into this one, however, and my son left the room. It was clearly not meant to be a stand alone movie as the first and fell into the trap as so many movies do today: strictly to set up the sequel. In this case, its the setup for their Saturday cartoon series. Not impressed at all. I agree that this could have been used as part of the actual series and not pushed as a true movie. No wonder I look forward more to Pixar's productions than Disney's nowadays.",
