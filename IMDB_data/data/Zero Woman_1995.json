        "reviewBody": "This movie begins with 2 men and a woman forcibly taking a briefcase full of stock certificates from a courier inside an underground garage. As it so happens, a special agent for the Japanese government known as Zero Division, attempts to retake the briefcase but the thieves manage to get away. In the process the agent, \"Rei\" (Natsuki Ozawa) also has to kill the courier in self-defense. After informing a colleague of the incident the two of them set out to track down the thieves and recover the briefcase. The problem is that there are interpersonal relationships among both sides which complicate matters even further. Additionally, not all of the characters involved have the same agenda as everyone else. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this turned out to be an interesting film which was essentially based on an earlier movie titled \"Zero Woman-Red Handcuffs\" produced 21 years earlier. So in that respect the movie is a sequel of sorts even though the main character is played by another actress. Be that as it may, this film has plenty of action which includes more than a few scenarios involving violence along with several scenes of a sexual nature. For that reason this movie is clearly not suitable for minors. In any case, while not necessarily a great movie, it was still somewhat entertaining and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",
