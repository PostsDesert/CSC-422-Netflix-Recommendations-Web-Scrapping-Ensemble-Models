        "reviewBody": "When a pair of thieves steal Frog's (Sammo Hung) wallet, it's revealed that he possesses the 'invincible armor' which immediately becomes the center point of everyone's desire including another swindler, Tiger. They must work together when a master of crab fist obtains the armor. There isn't a lot in the way of redeeming characters in this one. Everyone is willing to go to any lengths to have the armor and get the upper hand, but regardless there is plenty of fun and humor. The fighting is pretty solid though it never gets too creative. The end fight between Frog and Tiger features some wicked three section staff fighting. A lot of familiar faces in this one too including Karl Maka, Lam Ching Yung, and many of Sammo's regulars."
