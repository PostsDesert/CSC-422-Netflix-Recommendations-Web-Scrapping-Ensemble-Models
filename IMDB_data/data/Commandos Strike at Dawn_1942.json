        "name": "An excellent example of WWII Propaganda films",
        "reviewBody": "For we amateur historians this early WWII American propaganda film is a treasure for its insights into attitudes about the German conquest of Europe.\n\nAmong the first of a long line of American propaganda films, it was actually filmed on Vancouver Island in Canada, because of its similarity to the Norwegian landscape. Real British and Canadian commandos were used to play the soldiers, both British and German. {The British and Canadians who had been at war for over two years were eager to assist the newly arrived Americans becoming involved}. The cast and crew stayed at the famous Empress Hotel in Victoria, about 10 miles from the filming site.\n\nThe script was adopted from a story by C.S. Forester, the famous British novelist of naval and maritime stories. The script was done by Irwin Shaw who would become a noted American novelist.\n\nThe film is probably too idealistic in its portrayal of good-hearted Europeans rising up against their Nazi conquerors. Only after the war did Europeans concoct an heroic resistance. The vast majority at the time however passively accepted German occupation. And for good reason. The Germans took brutal reprisals against any sign of resistance. Unlike in the movie, most conquered peoples kept their heads down and waited for the Allied armies to save them. Nonetheless, the film probably reassured American audiences that Europeans were eagerly awaiting to help liberate the continent from Nazi oppressors.\n\nBtw, I had the opportunity to discuss the making of the movie with Ann Carter, who at age 6 played \"Solveig\", the daughter of Paul Muni's character. I have added some of her recollections in the comments section.\n\nBlaine in Seattle, U.S.A.",
