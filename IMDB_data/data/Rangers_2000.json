He believes he was betrayed by the Ranger Team and his CIA handlers. For five millions dollars and a chance at revenge he turns renegade. Now there is no need to watch the movie.\n\nEXCEPT, this has got to be the worst movie never made. That's right never made. It consists of copied footage from a lot of movies. And that's about the only thing about it to recommend. You can turn this piece of crap into a trivia game. Name the stolen movie footage. The winner never has to watch it again.\n\nLook for footage from Navy Seals, Delta Force, Invasion USA, Hidden, Invasion USA again and again and Red Heat. And that's just the ones I spotted. Its not hard there is no continuity and the film stock doesn't even match. My favorite scene is during the car chase when the antihero Glenn Plummer shoots out the rear windshield without hitting the front windshield.\n\nYou have been warned"
