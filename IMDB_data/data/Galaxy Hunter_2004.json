Anyone who has seen Tiffany in anything she's ever been in you know that she is talented, funny and most of all Gorgeous. Regardless of how poor the script, filming quality or anything else about the movie, the mere appearance of Tiffany Bolton makes the movie or venture worth seeing and entertaining! She is without a doubt the Lucille Ball of her time! If you watch any of her performances in Black Tie Nights you will see that she is charming, witty, funny and very charismatic. She delivers lines with flawless accuracy and her appearance and facial expressions absolutely steals the viewer's eyes whenever she is on screen and is done so effortlessly, it's clearly second nature to her. She is without a doubt the most pure, natural actress working today. And if you ever get the chance to see her performances in \"The Girly Show\" she is an absolute delight to watch!",
