After trying to find Chibi-Usa and fight off Vadiane's henchmen to no avail, the three outer senshi (Neptune, Uranus, and Pluto) come to their aid. To rescue Chibi-Usa before she falls into a permanent dream filled sleep, Usagi must enter the Black Dream hole and save her. With some luck and a lot of effort, Sailor Moon saves Chibi-Usa, and she transforms to help Usagi.\n\nThe movie itself wasn't as great as the two but it was still good for what it's worth. It just felt too much like retell of The Legend of the Pied Piper but with the sailor scouts.",
