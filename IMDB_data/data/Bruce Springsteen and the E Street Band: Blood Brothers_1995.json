The atmosphere positively floods out of the screen to envelop you and the hairs on your neck will be standing on end before the first note has been struck. After watching this you'll believe that The Boss is incapable of putting a foot wrong. By the end, he's only just short of defying gravity.\n\nThis trumps just about every other concert ever, Woodstock, Glastonbury, Live Aid, nothing feels like this. As Springsteen himself acknowledges during the show this is not just music. This is religion.",
