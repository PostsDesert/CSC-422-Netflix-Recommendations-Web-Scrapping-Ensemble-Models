I would have to agree with them. Whereas the first film had so many memorable and classic moments, this one just does not have that level of impact. Still fun and funny, but not the cultural milestone of the first film.\n\nWhere this film excels is in the casting of Paul Reubens, Phil Hartman, Elvira, Edie McClurg and the Groundlings. And, before the Pee-Wee Herman movie did it, the use of the song \"Tequila\". Seeing the Groundlings together in one film before many (most?) of them broke into the big time is a special treat.",
