        "reviewBody": "The Harry Bromley-Davenport Xtro series gets worse as it goes along as here a crew is sent to an island to get rid of any left over ammo or weaponry from WWII so that they can create a refueling station. Only this crew likely wouldn't last a week and a half in the real American military with the drug use and serious mental problems that they show. In turn they stumble across an alien who is quite obviously upset and needs to open a can of whoop-ass. Sub par effects and even worse music. I would definitely suggest avoiding this entirely. Does star Robert Culp as Major Guardino who sets the crew up for the mission. Just stick with the original in the series (which this movie has nothing to do with).",
