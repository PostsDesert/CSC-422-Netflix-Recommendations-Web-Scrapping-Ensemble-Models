        "reviewBody": "George Harrison: The Quiet One (2002) \n\n** 1/2 (out of 4)\n\nThis documentary has certainly been replaced by the longer and much more detailed one from Martin Scorsese but if you're a die-hard fan of the musician then you'll probably want to check this one out too since it does feature interviews with George Martin, Tony Calder (former agent) and Rod Othen (school friend) as well as archival interviews with The Beatles, Paul McCartney and others. \n\nThe documentary runs just under a hour and rushes to get the highlights of George's life in here. We get a few stories about his early days but then we jump to The Beatles, his songwriting, his religious moments and of course some of the tabloid stuff with Eric Clapton. The documentary also covers his near fatal attack as well as his death. Again, there's nothing great here as this was cheaply produced but what footage there is is entertaining and makes it worth watching."
