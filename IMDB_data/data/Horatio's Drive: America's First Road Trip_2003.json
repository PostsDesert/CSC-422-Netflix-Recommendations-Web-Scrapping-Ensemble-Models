He's an amateur who buys his own vehicle and personally funds most of his other expenses as well. He's challenged by a team sponsored by an auto maker.\n\nSomehow, Ken Burns finds just the right mix of archival and location footage to make it all a grand and very real adventure, an accomplishment given the limited resources with which he had to work.\n\nAnd then there's Bud, the dog who accompanied them, and for whom they fitted his own pair of driving goggles.",
