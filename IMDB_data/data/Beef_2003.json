        "reviewBody": "Beef is an interesting documentary on Hip Hop feuds. It covers almost all major feuds between rappers from early on in the hip hop world to recent times. While it goes into detail on some of the feuds more than others it still remains informative. I found it became a bit boring in some parts but that's really only because they were talking about rappers which I didn't know about or aren't interested in. The documentary has plenty of unseen and rare footage concerning each Beef which is good and also interesting interviews with some of the rappers and people involved. \n\nIt does go a bit overboard on some feuds and I began to loose interest in them, even if they were concerning my favourite rappers, but it makes up for it with the more interesting parts and information on beefs that I hadn't heard of.\n\nI thought the best parts were those covering the beefs between Kool Moe Bee and Busy Bee, Boogie Down Productions and MC Shan and feuds concerning NWA because they were informative, interesting and didn't go on for too long. \n\nOverall it is a good documentary and even though there are some dull bits, Beef is still a must see for any Hip Hop fan"
