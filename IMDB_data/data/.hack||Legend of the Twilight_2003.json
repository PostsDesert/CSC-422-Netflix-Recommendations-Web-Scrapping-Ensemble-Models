The Animation was good, but again, lacks what SIGN had. It wasn't dark, it wasn't chilling, it was too light and comical. I don't care if it had more action or not, action alonedoesn't make for better story telling. They made some interesting choices, but still, they really really lack on the suspense of it. It is rather predictable. Not to mention the \"What will happen next time\" Highlight Videos at the end of every episode. That kind of spoils it in my opinion. This show was good but not good enough. If I had to choose Sign, or this I would chose SIGN. I'm fairly disappointed.",
