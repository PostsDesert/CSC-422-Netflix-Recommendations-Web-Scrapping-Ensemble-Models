What are they going to do for an encore? Kick the homeless? Steal from the food shelves?\n\nThis movie is terrible. Not in the so bad it is good way. This movie should not be viewed by anyone - ever. The plot is incoherent - acting wooden and has more holes in the plot than swiss cheese. I think this film can kill puppies, club seals, slash the rain forest, throw kittens in the river, oils penguins.\n\nI'm going to get a roofalate and see if I can forget this movie.",
