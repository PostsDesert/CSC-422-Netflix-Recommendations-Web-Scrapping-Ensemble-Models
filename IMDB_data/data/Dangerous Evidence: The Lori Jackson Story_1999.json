        "reviewBody": "Though the movie didn't portray our true family (only my mother and my aunt Dena)the story was excellent and I feel that it was good to give her credit. I never got to meet her because she died before i was born(my mother was pregnant with me during the cancer), but the stories of her really are amazing. She endured so much from her community as far as racism goes; she fought for so much and I am so proud to be her granddaughter.There are magazine articles, CNN has interview tapes... you name it- she was a woman who made her cause known- I'm so proud!Lynn Whitfield portrayed her well- and resembles her good too( she was a cross between her and Tina Turner-i think)... and if you pay attention to the court scenes you'll see my grandfather(the REAL Paul Jackson); they were 20 yrs apart and to my knowledge- no one loved her as much!",
