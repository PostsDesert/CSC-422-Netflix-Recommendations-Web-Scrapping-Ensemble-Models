        "reviewBody": "A reasonable retelling of \"Faust\" as a high-school comedy, the film is let down a little by a low budget and inexperienced director. It works well in parts, but there are occasional scenes which quite clearly don't work. One example - when the devil's agent (Kevin Pollack) is disguised as an ice-cream man he \"scares\" away some kids by throwing what looks like a few scraps of paper at them! Without the luxury of re-shoots, scenes like that needed either some imaginative work in post-production or someone brave enough to leave them on the cutting room floor. Instead, they are left in and undermine the good work elsewhere.\n\nOverall it's a enjoyable family comedy with good performances from the main cast. Shiri Appleby looks suitably stunning as the object of Michael Goorjian's affections and does a good job of making more of the role than the script gives her.",
