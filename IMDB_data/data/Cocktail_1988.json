        "reviewBody": "Cocktail (1988) \n\n** 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nBlockbuster about a young man (Tom Cruise) who dreams of having money and fame but soon his bar-tending skills lead him to Jamaica where he falls in love with a woman (Elisabeth Shue). COCKTAIL was a gigantic hit when it was released and looking back on the film you can't help but see it like so many other hits of its day. While the film remains slightly entertaining there's still no question that the story itself is downright stupid and contains some pretty idiotic moments throughout. One of the most embarrassing scenes happens towards the end of the picture between Cruise and the woman's father but I won't spoil this scene for those who haven't seen the film. A lot of the movie just seems to happen for no reason other to try and jam every type of emotion down the viewer's throat. Again, I'm not going to spoil what happens to one of the major supporting characters but this little twist just doesn't work and really goes against everything else we've seen in the film. With that said, there's no question that Cruise is in fine form here as he was really finding his own. Shue is also extremely good in her role and the two stars share some really good chemistry. The same for Bryan Brown who adds a lot of fun with his supporting role and the magic between he and Cruise certainly helps the entertainment factor. Kelly Lynch and Gina Gershon can also be seen. The film's biggest highlight is the terrific soundtrack, which has everyone from The Beach Boys to John Mellencamp. COCKTAIL is an entertaining movie but at the same time it's quite shallow and really starts to slow down towards the end. Fans of Cruise will still want to check it out even with the flaws."
