        "reviewBody": "We enjoyed this sweet little movie very much. We had not seen the first film so this was our introduction to the Benji saga. It's a typical plot, however unlikely, about spies using Benji to smuggle secrets and the efforts of all concerned to capture him, all taking place in the streets and hillsides of Athens, Greece. Benji is utterly charming. It is a joy to watch him as he makes his rounds and does what needs to be done. Yes, he runs a lot, and very fast for a small dog. What heart Benji has! A true family movie. Benji is adorable in this film. If you like dogs or animal movies and are still a bit young at heart you will enjoy this. As a result of watching \"For The Love Of Benji\" we will definitely check out the original \"Benji\" movie, which was a sensation back in the 1970s.",
