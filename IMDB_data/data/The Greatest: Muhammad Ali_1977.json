        "reviewBody": "We've all seen the highlights of Muhammad Ali's boxing career, but what happened in his life is just as important. \"The Trials of Muhammad Ali\" has a title that one might interpret as a double meaning. There was the US government's prosecution of him for refusing to fight in the Vietnam War, and there were the events in his personal life. The point is that Ali stood up for what he believed, and made sure that the world heard his opinion.\n\nWe could be cynical and say that the documentary gives a little too much time to the interviewees, but the archive footage makes up for that. It's clear that the government saw all black political movements as suspect, especially Islam. Among the interviewees, John Carlos - who made a political statement at the 1968 Olympics - makes probably the most important comment.\n\nWell, Ali got vindicated. He lit the torch at the 1996 Olympics and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005. There's also a clip of him interviewed right after the 9/11 attacks warning not to view all Muslims as Osama bin Laden.\n\nDefinitely see this documentary.",
