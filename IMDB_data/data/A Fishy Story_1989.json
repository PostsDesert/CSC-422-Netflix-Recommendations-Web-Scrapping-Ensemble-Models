I really like this movie back then mainly because of Maggie Cheung. After watching this movie again, I can tell you that this is a truly beautiful movie.\n\n To briefly summarize the plot, \"A fishy Story\" is a love story set amid the political chaos in Hong Kong during the 1960s. Maggie Cheung were magnificent in portraying the sexy, glamorous young women seeking fame and fortune during a chaotic era of Hong Kong history. Along the adventure, she met Kenny Bee, a lonely and struggling cab driver who were renting a small room just above her apartment.\n\nThis movie was shot beautifully and has a high production value. The acting from all the cast members were wonderful. Maggie Cheung deserve her best actress award in the 1990 Hong Kong film festival. This is one of her earlier movie where she showed the critics that she is not only a pretty face, but a very talented actress as well.\n\nI highly recommend this movie whether you're a foreign film fans, or a person who appreciates good movie.",
