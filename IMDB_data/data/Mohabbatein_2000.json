        "reviewBody": "Mohabbatein is the second directorial of aditya chopra after ddlj. Narayan Shankar (Big b) is a strict authoritarian running a school named gurukul with three rules- parampara,prateestha, anushasan. Meaning only focus on studies. Enters into the school raj aryan(srk), as a violin teacher who focuses on everyone to love. This irks narayan shankar and later it is revealed that raj was a former student of gurukul thrown out by shankar for loving his daughter meghna(aishwarya rai) who committed suicide after that. Raj has entered here to take revenge on shankar by turning his disciplinary school with love and romance. The story also focuses on 3 students of gurukul- Vicky (uday chopra), sameer(jugal hansraj) and karan(Jimmy shergill). Vicky falls in love with the neighboring school student ishika(shamita shetty), sameer is in love with his childhood friend sanjana(kim sharma) and karan falls in love with a young widow kiran(preethi jhangiani). Rest of the movie is how raj helps these boys and whether he could defeat narayan shankar or not. Highlight of this film is the faceoff of two big superstars itself. After several failures as a lead actor in 90s, bachchan decided to shed all his superstar image and become into a character actor through this film. Mohabbatein started a new phase for big b as what we see him today. SRK's raj is overly romantic. Both of their combination scenes are handled well. Among the three love stories, my favorite one is karan and kiran's only. Vicky and ishika one is childish and sameer sanjana one is meh. Today, none of the female lead actress could shine in Bollywood and in males only Jimmy is today a successful actor. There is also one side track of anupam kher and archana puran singh as the clich√© sardar which is forgettable. Songs look good on screen. Production values of yrf are grand. But the movie is too long and far too unrealistic. On the whole, mohabbatein can be enjoyed if you ignore its unrealistic plot and if you are a big fan of these superstars.",
