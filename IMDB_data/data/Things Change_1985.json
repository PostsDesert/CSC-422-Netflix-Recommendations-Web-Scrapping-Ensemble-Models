Mantegna and Ameche are so opposite and I really can't share the view of other people that Ameche is performing a \"Being There.\" Ameche is much smarter, he realizes from the start something is wrong. First he declines the offer but he knows perfectly well these people will shoot him (remember the scene with the smoking lady). Then, the movie starts, and he's in charge, and he keeps in charge, he accepts a luncheon with a Don in LA., he finds money to get back to Chicago, he uses his coin to call the Las Vegas mob.\n\nNice, entertaining, two and a half stars. I laughed quite a bit. Must be my Italian roots.",
