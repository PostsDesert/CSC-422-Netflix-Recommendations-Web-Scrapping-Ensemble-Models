The pace is fast and the effects plentiful!\n\nThere are a few logical problems, like why is it the fireman, among thousands of security personnel in DC, that is the only one going after the killer, when the latter is trying to turn DC into an inferno?!\n\nLots of good actors, nice cinematography and special effects, in short better than average, but the misses are sometimes bad, like not getting Colombia's map correct! That he can travel on someone else's pass is also amazing. \n\nBut it is fairly logical, in its own context, so you don't mind the misses the first time you see it!\n\nNot too bad for a hero, over 50 :-)!",
