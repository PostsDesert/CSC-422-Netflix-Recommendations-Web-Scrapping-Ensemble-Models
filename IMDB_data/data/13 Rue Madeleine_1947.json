Cagney is one of the chief instructors in a US spy school (all the action happens in World War Two). Cagney finds out there is a top German agent going through this school. Cagney decides to let the German agent finished the training course and let him (German agent) parachute into occupied France (so the enemy agent will give the Germans false information). All this happens shortly before D-Day. However, the operation goes sour and Cagney has to parachute in to try to save the day.\n\nI won't comment anymore on the plot as to not spoil the movie.\n\nProbably the best World War Two spy/counterspy movies I have seen. I rate it high marks, very high marks indeed."
