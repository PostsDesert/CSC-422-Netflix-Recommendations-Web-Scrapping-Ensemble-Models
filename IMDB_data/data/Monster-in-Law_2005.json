It made me want to kill little puppy's and eat their intestants, just because that would be a fun way to pass my time compared to this. \n\nThe acting was horrible, I always thought JLo would be better than that, because I didn't necessarily dislike her in Cell. But to my utter discontent she wasn't. But I do have to say that she stood out. The rest of the cast acted like they were disabled people jumping around, the only thing that was missing was the restraining jacket. \n\nJust plain stupid, because the story didn't have to turn out so bad."
