This film, despite its rather gloomy setting, is eventually all about redemption and hope. The stories of those in Lift are noble, real narratives about love, courage, and transformations. This powerful film makes a fitting and powerful commentary about the dangers of materialism and about internalizing mainstream (read: white) notions of beauty and worth, especially for those in the African American community.",
