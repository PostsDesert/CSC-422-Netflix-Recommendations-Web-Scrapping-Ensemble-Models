Jay is only in the movie a short time and hardly recognizable with the goatee they have him wearing. The entire plot of the movie is dumb, and unrealistic. I think that someone envisioned this movie as being a \"Boyz in the Hood\" or \"Menace 2 Society\" for girls but it doesn't even come close. The silly subplot about the dance routines only wastes more time and serves no purpose. If you're looking for a female coming of age story check out \"Thirteen\", a Jay Hernandez is hot movie \"crazy/beautiful\", a gangster movie, \"Boyz in the Hood\" even if you've already seen them before I promise you're better off than watching this clunker of a film.",
