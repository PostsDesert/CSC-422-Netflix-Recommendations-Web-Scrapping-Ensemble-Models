I only wonder how a first time director got him. The story is gripping and the cinematography is haunting. As I watched it I just kept wondering how it would end. I never saw the real ending coming. I loved all the characters and even wanted more. The juxtaposition of the two story lines was fascinating. I wanted to hate someone but couldn't. The only bad guy is the cop. Everyone makes mistakes but his just seem so brutal. I had never noticed Jennifer Connelly before but I will make an effort to see any films with her in the future. As I watched this film I asked if I should make some changes in my own life so that this sort of thing doesn't happen to me. If you read the synopsis you will miss what this movie is really about. Watch it. You will be better for it.",
