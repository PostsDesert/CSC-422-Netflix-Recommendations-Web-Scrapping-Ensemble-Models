It's dark, attempts to be psycho-sexual (succeeds in the latter), and ends up just being rather sad. But, I felt something, and that is more of a reaction than most movies inspire in me these days. Those who feel this is the worst film they have ever seen have obviously never seen anything with Keanu Reeves or Steven Segal. Or Ben Affleck. Or...\n\nAnyway, it's more interesting than a disaster film, so, you decide."
