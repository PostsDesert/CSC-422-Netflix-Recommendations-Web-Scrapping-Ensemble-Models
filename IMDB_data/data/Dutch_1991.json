The things that Dolye and Dutch say to each other are so funny, they always make me laugh. I must say Doyle is a real brat though. Theres so many memorable things in this movie....all the great funny quotes...all of Dutch and Dolye's arguments....the fire works scene...and I really like the scene with the 2 call girl babes :)\n\nThis is a great movie that I still watch all the time. I recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh like me ( :"
