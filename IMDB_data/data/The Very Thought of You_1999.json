        "reviewBody": "I saw this film with the title \"The Very Thought of You\" and think that \"Martha, Meet Frank, Daniel and Laurence\" is far more apropos and distinctive, although a bit of a mouthful to casually mention the film to friends. I expect that far too few persons will see this delightful film. I was particularly charmed by Laurence's description of the \"perfect woman\" and even more charmed when (as if I might have missed it) it was replayed! The film is worthy of smiles and laughs throughout, with an especially funny moment which rippled through the audience in laughter for many moments into the next scene. It is artistically directed and edited, intelligently written, and well acted (except when Monica Potter seemed to sound like Julia Roberts -- I can't imagine why she would want to do that). Interestingly, Joseph Finnes is also outstanding in one of the films that I believe is among the best of the decade: \"Shakespeare in Love.\" I find the implausibility of this is irrelevant -- it's an 83-minute movie that sets out to capture a mood, tell a story, and entertain. I expect that many will easily brush this film off as \"cute and sweet\" but I personally would love to see more films that are as well-constructed and intelligent.",
