The pace is fast, and there is always something to keep the adrenaline pumping.The action sequences are cool and very realistic. If it was to be transformed into a real film with actors, making a carbon copy would not look out of place. Usually for animation spin-offs they don't get the start to voice it, but in here I am impressed and glad that they got Vin Diesel to voice Riddick.\n\nEven though I forgot the plots of the two Riddick films, I still enjoyed \"The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury\" as a stand-along animation."
