Film details their intricate plan to do so, which involves an excellent cast including Charles Durning, Ray Walston, & Eileen Brennan, among others. The story climaxes in an elaborate swindle that may well fool the audience. Fine use of vintage 1930's jazz music appropriate for the period.\n\nWouldn't go so far as giving it the best picture award, however, since it is just a good film, not in any way a great one, though it was a big hit at the time.",
