        "reviewBody": "Critics didn't get this film back in the day. The critics didn't understand that this was a send-up of spy movies, Clint-style. Vonneta McGee steals the film as Jemima Brown. Jack Cassidy is marvelous as a flagrantly gay agent. Thayer David is absolutely inspired as Eastwood's macabre boss, and all the minor characters play like James Bond supervillains on Bizarro-world. And, stoic Clint plays off all of them magnificently at every opportunity. Meanwhile, George Kennedy is perfect, playing straight man for all the bizarre characters all around him. This is as hysterical a spy farce as I have ever seen. This was a good movie. It was a little far-fetched, but despite that the climbing scenes were very good and Eastwood was his typical self. The plot is also not bad. Overall this was a good Eastwood movie and for those who fans of Eastwood and climbing movies."
