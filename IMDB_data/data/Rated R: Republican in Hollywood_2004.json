Yes, people there are actual celebrities in Hollywood who are not too cowardly to say they vote Republican like most of us non-celebrity Americans did this last election. With the current liberal media preaching tolerance this documentary will hopefully convince all those touting this abused word to actually follow their own advice when conservative, working actors, comedians, musicians state their own conservative point of view. You have gotta hand it to former Democratic speech writer Jesse Moss for delving into such a provocative topic such as this.",
