        "reviewBody": "This installment is about F. Scott Fitzgerald...or, more properly, a bit about Fitzgerald and more about his work. That is because in many ways the biography was a whitewash and ignored the most negative aspects of a very screwed up guy. A great writer, yes. But not much of a human being.\n\nThe film consists of a few interviews with elderly folks who barely knew him when they were children and Fitzgerald was a raging alcoholic. They describe him as a nice guy--though these accounts seem more self-serving to paint Fitzgerald as a pained man tortured by his demons. However, he also was at times very violent and apparently beat the crap out of his lover, Gloria Graham and alienated himself from practically everyone. And, there have been folks who have wondered if F. Scott institutionalized his wife more out of his own convenience. Not to mention any of these theories or accounts by Graham of the violence just seems like a whitewash, thought the show did go out of its way to attack Hemingway (hey, I won't defend this guy). An odd portrait...and a not particularly reliable one.",
