        "reviewBody": "This film had a pensive effect on me. For some reason, it reminded me of F*cking Åmål, (don't go All-American/FakeChristian/MidWestern hypocrite on me and report this, it's the official IMDb title --> http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0150662/), perhaps it is the theme of childhood or teenage-ship which runs through both of them. When I watched F*cking Åmål, I strongly felt that it showed a world of teenagers lost to me now forever and 'Goyangileul Butaghae' is actually about that, so there. It's quite a film with a lot of recognition, even if one is not a twenty something female, but a European male from a different age group altogether. For the first minute that I watched it, I didn't realize that it wasn't a European film. I was just zapping. And I'm kind of sorry that I didn't tape this one. Because the film's beautiful sadness or melancholy, is striking indeed. It's really a film which you wanna own on DVD or tape. Quite nice to get a peek inside Korean teenage-twins life, the harsh differences (the policeman telling an orphaned girl who just lost her grandparents due to a collapsed roof too that she should count herself lucky to be rid of a burden) and the similarities (the way they deal with boys etc).\n\nOkay, maybe I just liked this film because it's about five attractive girls and I'm male but that's not all of it. Like the other users said, its atmosphere, the 'odeur' is so beautiful. The ending (it was my favorite type of ending. Don't worry, I won't tell;) ) screams for a sequel! I wanna see more! How about 'Tae-hie and Ji-young's Travel Adventure'? And where can I get the music?\n\nThe Melancholic Alcoholic.",
