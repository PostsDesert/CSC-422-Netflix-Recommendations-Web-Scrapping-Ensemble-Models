The filmmakers allowed the story to unfold and give the audience credit for being able to come to their won conclusions about what they think of what Kurt Gerron did. It is the first time I have seen a film set against the holocaust that went beyond the horror stories we are already familiar with and examines a victim of nazi atrocities who in a strange way became a part of the propaganda machine. I think everyone should see this beautifully made film!",
