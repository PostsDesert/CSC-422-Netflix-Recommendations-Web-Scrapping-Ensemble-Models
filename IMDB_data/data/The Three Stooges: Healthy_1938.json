        "reviewBody": "Not a major remake fan in general. In this case a modern feature length remake of the trio made famous by their one hundred and ninety short films between 1922 and '70.\n\nPerhaps the greatest sin of all is making this Three Stooges production in colour.\n\nDo yourself a favour and make this movie much, much better by turning down the colour on your TV to its lowest setting-the point at which the picture becomes black and white.\n\nGive it a try and you'll see this Stooges' film is instantly ten times better and more familiar. Why this was not completely obvious to the Farrelly Brothers during the planning of this movie I don't understand. And if the studios were demanding colour then The Farrelly Brothers should have played hardball saying they would rather not make the film.\n\nThe story is mediocre; the gags are Stooges' gags; some of the acting is good, and some poor. The film being in colour is unforgivable. The Three Stooges is and always will be seared into the public consciousness as short sketch films in black and white. Do yourself a favour and watch it in B&W. The visual gags lend themselves to black and white better. I went as far as to convert my copy of the film to a permanent B&W copy using the application Handbrake on my computer. If I can help it I will never watch this film in colour again.",
