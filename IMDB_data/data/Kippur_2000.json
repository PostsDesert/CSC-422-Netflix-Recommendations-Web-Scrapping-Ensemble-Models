        "reviewBody": "This film offers more of an artistic view of warfare on a level that one normally does not see; even though the dialog in the film is small, and even though what dialog there is does not focus on the main, overriding theme of the vile nature of war the point is still clearly conveyed by the director's use of his actors and the camera. \n\nOverall, the film could have been much shorter; it was seemingly dragged out at times, and sometimes it seemed downright tiring to watch. However, some of the shots throughout the film were very good, and the story at times can be interesting. But when all is said and done, this is not a very high quality film due to its' unnecessary length and often overly artistic portrayal. The few moments of good cinema in here do not make the whole thing worth watching.",
