With that said, I still somewhat enjoyed this, but the use of CG instead of hand drawn animation really took away from it. It's not the worst CG I've seen, it was actually pretty good for a direct to DVD release, but it just seemed too different from the cartoons and comics to have it feel like the same series. Despite these problems, at a mere 77 minutes, I was able to sit and just enjoy it as a free rental since the story itself was still classic Joe. If you want to rent something GI Joe, rent the original season, unless you want something new, but it won't hurt to watch it with a younger kid or relative.",
