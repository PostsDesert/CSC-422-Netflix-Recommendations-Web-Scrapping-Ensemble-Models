        "reviewBody": "Night Patrol is one sleazy movie. From the opening frames, the attention grabbing sexual and toilet humor are relentless. Though kind of redundant, this film does actually produce some good laughs. This movie is like a very raunchy Airplane. And like those films, they hit you with so many jokes that you can't help but laugh at more than a few of them.\n\nThe story deals with a mild-mannered policeman who moonlights as a comedian who wears a bag over his head while telling jokes. This guy is played by someone named Murray Langston who may or may not have been a successful comic at this time. All I got from his routine is that he seems to be reading his jokes straight out of those Truly Tasteless Jokes books that were all the rage in the early 1980s. I recognized a lot of humor from this movie as also being found in those books. Pat Paulsen, also a comic, played his partner on the force. And the guy is physically a dead ringer for former Buffalo Bills coach Marv Levy. Dwarf Billy Barty, Linda Blair(?), and Andrew Dice Clay have smaller parts. The film also wishes to be some type of mystery, as someone pretending to be this \"Unknown Comic\" is robbing every sleazy bar in L.A.. Is the unknown comic also the robber, or are they planning some big unmasking scene for the film's conclusion that is supposed to be surprising? If you did not guess the second option, then.... I guess it doesn't matter anyway.\n\nNight Patrol would probably best be viewed drunk and with a bunch of rowdy friends. You will probably laugh at it more than you'll plan to, but it is far from classic. There are some very hot women in it, and some good nudity, too. Remember those days when movies had notable nude scenes? This film may jog your memory. And a pretty funny cameo from Pat Morita as a \"rape victim\" is also found here. 5 of 10 stars.\n\nThe Hound.",
