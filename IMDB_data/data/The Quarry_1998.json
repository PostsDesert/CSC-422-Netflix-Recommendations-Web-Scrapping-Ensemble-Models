        "reviewBody": "I just finished watching this movie this minute and i don't feel satisfied, it did not get together in the end, maybe that is the whole point when one looks at it on a larger scale concerning the human situation keeping at heart and in mind the stirrings of the soul. i mean this film did have its moments and it did keep me interested and maybe I dare to say that it was overall tight to the subject. I knew way in advance that he would give himself up, due to the fact that he was dealing with The book of books here and the fact that the priest he killed did tell ask him to open up \"What are you running away from?\" The barren desert areas do suggest a biblical story. Finally the fact that the younger brother not without reason nicknamed \"Small\" is the greatest and the one who is set free. This film echoes the words of The Lord. I got to point out how other characters besides our hero here have secrets and their share of sins, like the rest of us, which they want to conceal, the conscience is making them feel a sense of shame like the love affair between the chief cop and the lady carer. the cop winds up committing the same crime/sin as our \"hero\". I like the fact that the hero is shot dead on the rail track which makes a lot of sense since he was, or at least we are given the impression that he has been living a trail of the kind of stuff we are allowed to know of him from when the movie begins, he is already running away.",
