        "reviewBody": "As a teen myself, I think \"The Biggest Fan\" is a great teen and pre-teen oriented film. I have seen the movie a total of 3 times and counting, and I think it will be a box office hit for teens when it hits theaters. The movie is a classic \"dream come true\" love story for teens, with a more modern tempo, featuring a popular boy band, Dream Street. Kaila Amariah, the main female character, portrays a devoted fan of Chris Trousdale, the main male character, the best that I have seen in a teen movie! Between the music and the acting, the film is awesome! The funny one liners could even get an adult laughing, while pleasing a younger audience at the same time. The audiences that I have seen this with have responded excitedly, some even memorizing lines (which I may say I'm guilty of!). This film is going to be a favorite for many when seen for the first time in theaters!",
