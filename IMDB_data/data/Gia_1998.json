        "reviewBody": "When Cindy Crawford first entered the modeling world, she was dubbed, \"Baby Gia.\" Her likeness to the model that was beyond perfection was what helped boost her career. Crawford, knew little about Carangi and her struggle.\n\nWhen Stephen Fried published Thing of Beauty in 1993, he shed light on the exotic beauty known as Gia. He exposed the dark side of modeling, and showed the world the rise and fall of one of the most beautiful girls to ever live.\n\nThe movie Gia, is based of Fried's book. However, the movie takes several liberties. Gia's lover, \"Linda\", is based of Sandy Linter, a make-up artist in which Gia wooed and dated. Gia also dated a women by the name of Alyssa (she used the alias \"Rochelle\" in Fried's book). The writers combined these two loves, however, down played Alyssa's personality and character.\n\nGia's \"journals\" never existed. She did keep date books, too keep track of her appointments, and occasionally wrote things, but she never had an extensive amount of journals like the movie portrays. Gia's time in rehab is also downplayed.\n\nWithout a doubt, the movie is good, but if you want to know more about Gia, check out the book.",
