Everything about this movie is bad; the acting (what little there is), the story (what little there is) and the special effects. The only thing it accomplishes is being a total gross-out. If you like steamy sex scenes to then see the woman get mutilated during childbirth, this movie is for you! Even if you only watched this movie to see Natasha H. get naked, you'll probably even be disappointed there! And the end where the aliens have sex is simply the stupidist I've seen. The special effects look like a cheap rip-off from Aliens and the way the male Species suffocates Eve with what looks like a phallic tentacle is beyond dumb.\n\nI cannot recommend this movie to anyone."
