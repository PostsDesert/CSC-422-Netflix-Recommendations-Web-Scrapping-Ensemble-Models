        "reviewBody": "O.K.,I've just seen the movie \"Ed Wood\",listed currently in the best 250 of all time . Being listed there is a hard thing to reach as well as being listed in the worst 100 where \"Plan 9\" surely belongs .\"Ed Wood\" is all about a young wannabe-producer/director who is so fascinated and driven by the idea of producing movies that he does everything,sets every wheel in motion to make his dreams become reality,doing movies with a least-cost budget simply because he couldn't afford anything else,but he gave his whole heart to that movies and dedicated his whole life to them .\n\nO. K. --- \n\nMaybe that movie glorifies Ed Wood a bit.I don't know.Ed Wood is, by the way the director of \"Plan 9\".Having seen the above mentioned movie before, I just cannot help enjoying Plan 9. And, for the record , I was not LAUGHING about it , I have been SMILING nicely, about a film that has been done in a time when computer-effects were not yet invented, and, I enjoyed it. And there have been definitely worse movies.Maybe the director wasn't so bad at all but simply didn't have the money to make it better,maybe he had the talent to do better but not alone as writer,producer,director? At least he DID a movie. And I don't know whether I might be childish here, but that guy at least did what he wanted to do ,and here we are , 50 years later, still discussing his movie. The keyword is fantasy. If you put a little fantasy into the story , you might as well believe in it. A book doesn't give you any special effects at all and you can still enjoy it, can't you??? On the other hand, if you are so cool and so good in discovering any movies weakness and every leak of special effects that even the major 21st century Hollywood movies hardly get to you anymore,you will surely find a lot to complain about in this one. Or you can simply take it as an eyewitness of a time, long time gone, when life wasn't so \"perfect\" and peoples' brains weren't so oversaturated yet, that some guys still went to cinemas to see flying saucers..."
