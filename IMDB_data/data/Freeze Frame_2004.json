We all know his comedy skills aren't lacking (think Parole Officer) but this picture really does show off his acting abilities.\n\nI found it a little slow to start, but it keeps you guessing all the way, whether this is intentional or not it certainly keeps you glued to the screen!\n\nMy advice is go grab it! Probably not one to watch again and again but certainly an enjoyable movie, Evans really does shine and makes this movie. Watch out for the crazy plot twist at the end, beats sixth sense's twists any day!"
