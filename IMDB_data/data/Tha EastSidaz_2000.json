        "reviewBody": "As an 18 year old I was a big fan of the music Snoop made with Tha Eastsidaz. Sure it was obnoxious and ignorant but the P-Funk influenced beats and gritty vocal tones of Goldie Loc and Tray Deee proved to be an irresistible combination for me and my friends. Despite being fans we all had to admit this movie was sh*t. It's weaknesses are all summed up in the other reviews here. Most notable are the horrible camera-work and some messy dialogue . It's clear they were to lazy to rehearse most lines. I can imagine their reasoning, like 'Ey cuz, let's make this seem...natural, just do how we do, you know'. Sadly this doesn't work at all, with lines being mumbled and interrupted by others.\n\nWhen me and my friends first watched this we knew we had something bad when we saw the second scene. The first one isn't all that bad, as it sets the premise for the story and contains some graphic violence. The next scene destroys all this momentum as it takes far too long to pick up the story: we first have to watch minutes of Snoop and his homies smoking blunts in a depressing small storehouse. Still, this movie is a weird time capsule of a document. Four years after this Tray Deee (who plays the bad guy in this movie) would become disgruntled with Snoop Dogg and Tha Eastsidaz were disbanded.\n\nThe sloppiness of this movie also gives it an awkward charm, making it so obvious this thing was made by a group of guys who were meant to be musicians...but not movie makers. It's just a forgettable piece of work that's memorable for fans only. Or maybe also for 22th century students studying cinematic depictions of early 21th century Los Angeles gang culture. We'll see!",
