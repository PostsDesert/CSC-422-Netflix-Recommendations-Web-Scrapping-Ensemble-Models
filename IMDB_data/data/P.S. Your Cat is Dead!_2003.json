I decided to take a chance since I'm a big fan of the novel.\n\nThe gamble was worth it. Within two minutes, I was smiling and having a wonderful time. The movie helped me put things into perspective. Things could be more dire than my situation; I could be Jimmy (or worse, Eddie).\n\nLombardo Boyar should have gotten an Academy Award for his role as Eddie the would-be cat burglar. He made this a lot of fun to watch. Steve Guttenberg fared well at both directing and playing the half-crazed Jimmy Zoole.\n\nI highly recommend it for anyone who's a fan of the novel or has just had a horrendous day. I must warn you, however, that you have to have a sort of strange sense of humor to appreciate the movie.",
