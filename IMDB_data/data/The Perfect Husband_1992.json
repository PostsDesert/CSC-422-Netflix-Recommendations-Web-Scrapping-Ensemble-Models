        "reviewBody": "One of the most trying questions I always have for my friends whenever they have just seen a horror film that I have yet to see, is whether or not the film was scary. After all, what good is a horror film if it's not horrifying? I saw \"The Perfect Husband\" yesterday, and I was disappointed at first, but I slowly changed my mind. The film's story deals with a family tragedy as one couple tries to overcome the loss of their child. But, the husband (Bret Roberts) deals with his pain through torture. Now, the film's first trailer is hosted here.The clip shows the husband becoming more and more erratic. He confines his wife (Gabriella Wright), while attacking his neighbor. It seems that this vacation is just an opportunity to kill. Excellent storytelling makes this story refreshing. Movie will keep playing with audiences, making them guess which horror sub genre will it go as the movie closes in? Is it good old \"there's evil in the woods!\" story? Is it a ghost movie? Is it something entirely else? Good atmosphere, good use of sets and locations. Good acting by Gabriella Wright and Bret Roberts make somewhat B script seem much more larger and better then it actually is. It's moves slow at time which only adds to atmosphere and character build. Speaking of characters it's refreshing to see likable characters that you don't want to die immediately after they are introduced into the movie. It only adds up to horror when terror finally starts. Screenplay itself gives you just enough to know what's going on (mostly at the end), but thankfully nothing was over explained and too detailed. The Perfect Husband puts a very unique twist on the thriller/horror genre, and it is a very good movie in that right. 8/10",
