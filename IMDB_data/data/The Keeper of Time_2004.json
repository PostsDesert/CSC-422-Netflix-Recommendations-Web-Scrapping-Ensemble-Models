If your local Walmart doesn't have a dump bin that is suitable for you tastes in the extremely bad, go and find this movie at a local video store that carries EVERYTHING including porn... For some bizarre reason they have this. If you have seen the movie Max Magician and the Legand of the Rings, and like most who saw it, appreciate just how terrible it is, you will be disappointed in this film. Unlike such classic movie making horrors such as Max, this poor film does not even contain that type of entertainment. I swear it isn't worth it!!",
