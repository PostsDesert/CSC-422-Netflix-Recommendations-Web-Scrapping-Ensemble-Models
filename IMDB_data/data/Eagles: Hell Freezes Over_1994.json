        "reviewBody": "The 14 year vacation Glen speaks of in this concert has done nothing to dampen their spirits or their quality of music. Collectively their voices are just as strong now as they were in the mid 70's. This concert has captured all the magic that was and still is The Eagles. From the moment they hit the stage, the audience is kept spellbound as you will be when you see this. I would have liked to have seen this concert in its entirety but not withstanding that this is an excellent addition to anyones' music collection. For those wanting to buy a DTS or 5.1 surround sound system this DVD also has a side benefit in that it is perfect for what Digital Theatre Surround should sound like. For me, this is a 10 but then I am a fan.",
