        "reviewBody": "I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs. Revisited it recently. Three couples and a demented, creepy kid of one of the women get invited to a castle situated in the woodlands n away from civilization. Unknown to em, the host who is a professor has accidentally unleashed an evil curse thereby summoning up the dead from their graves.\n\nThe best part about this film is that it doesn't waste time, the zombies arrive instantly n the film maintains tension throughout.\n\nThose were the days when zombies were slow as snails with decayed teeth n almost blind but still able to relish human bodies.\n\nWait till u see the zombies in this film who display high levels of intelligence. They work as a team to break into a castle. They even carry different weapons, using tools, axes to chop through doors n they even shoot knives with accuracy n climb pillars. These zombies even kno how to put someone into a woodcutter machine but the kill is never shown.\n\nI was wondering how Michael reached the model factory. We have Mariangela Giordano showing off her tits, the masturbatory nun from Malabimba. (An amazing milf).\n\nPietro Barzocchini, who played the creepy kid is really freaky and his character disturbing and sick with an unhealthy Oedipal and incestuous relationship with his overly doting mother.\n\nThe maid's decapitation with a scythe is shown in a poorly lit scene n one cannot make out what is goin on.",
