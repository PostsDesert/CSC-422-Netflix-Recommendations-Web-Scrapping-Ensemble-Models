        "reviewBody": "I picked this up for business reasons, but I'll be damned if it wasn't a taut, little thriller that's actually far deeper than it would let on. You think it's a little scream-and-boob-fest about a serial killer, but in fact it turns out to be a rather interesting discourse on marriage, incest, control, sex and body image. Not bad at all, really! One minor problem I had with the picture... I know it's not a police procedural, but MAN the cops seem dumb: the guy's leaving evidence all over the place and a reporter seems to trump the cop in this. But, like I say, it's not a police procedural, the filmmakers get most things right. The principal cast is quite good, in particular the lead couple. And the soundtrack, while occasionally intrusive, is really quite impressive. I don't know how this film did so much with so little. Very few missteps in this film. These people should be congratulated. It didn't FEEL direct-to-video. It felt *shudder* like an art movie. And it's a damn sight better than the Swimming Pool, that overrated piece of French tripe that had just as much breastage, and a completely useless plot.",
