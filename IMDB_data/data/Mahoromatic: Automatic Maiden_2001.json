        "reviewBody": "I would say that I am new in the world of anime. The only ones I really watched was Love Hina, Love Hina Again and Excel Saga just before I began watching Mahoromatic.\n\nBeing a production of one of the most known and praised anime studios of Japan, studio Gainax (Neon Genesis Evangelion), it really is a masterpiece of animation. The characters are incredibly drawn, the music is amazing... But the really amazing in the series is the plot.\n\nIt begins as Mahoro, the ultimate combat robot of an organization that has as a purpose to defend Earth from invading aliens, is coming to an end. It is therefore given the opportunity to either live as a warrior for 40 more days, or get all of her combat capabilities removed and live for 398 days. She chooses the second option and wishes to work as a maid for Suguru-kun, a 14-year orphan. But nothing always is at it seems and none can escape their past...\n\nMahoromatic begins as a comedy but towards the end it becomes more and more serious. I wouldn't like to spoil the fun by revealing any other details of the plot. As for the ending... well... it was a life experience to me...\n\nThis is an adult anime, given the fact that a lot of nudity and violence occurs. But this is not really what it's all about. The plot really is a treatise on life with a lot of philosophical questions arising, especially towards the end. I was really amazed by the characters, considering their cuteness (Ka...Kawaiiii....), their simplicity and their truly humanitarian views towards life. Even though one might seem that the approach is simplistic, it is really through this simplicity that this anime reveals all of it's virtues.\n\nIt's an amazing, an incredible piece of work, a masterpiece in my opinion. And it is such a masterpiece, that I really cannot describe my feelings when I saw the last two episodes. All I can hope for is for more. Please, Gainax... if someone of you is reading this... please... give us some more!\n\nExtremely funny, extremely humane, extremely entertaining, extremely sentimental, extremely touching. Simply the best anime I've seen."
