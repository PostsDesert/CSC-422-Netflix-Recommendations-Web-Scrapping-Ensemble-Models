        "reviewBody": "I can't say there weren't a handful of somewhat enjoyable moments in this film, most of them simple, gratuitous comedic moments. But to be brutally honest, you would have to be very easily entertained to enjoy this flick. It's kind of like the producers just took small pieces of what worked in similar films and applied them with cut & paste. The plot line is extremely pedestrian and even less discernible. This worst thing about it though is that it's a blatant exploitation of the urban Black culture. Essentially every character is a drug-dealing, gun- toting, wanna-be mafioso. The characters and their lifestyles are of course part of American society, but is there anything positive or beneficial in exploiting this stereotype? I get that it's not supposed to be \"Boyz n' the Hood\", but there's simply nothing here of any redeeming quality. This has nothing to do with the color of the actors, simply the fact that the movie is a huge waste of time and completely intellectually devoid. It's a prime example of why most musicians should never think of crossing over into the realm of acting, unless of course they're simply making the movie for their own personal amusement. Otherwise, leave it to the professionals, please. 4/4",
