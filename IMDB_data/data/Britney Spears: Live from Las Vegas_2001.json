Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised. While I don't listen to bubble gum pop, I have to admit the show itself was great theatre. Yes, she lipsynched, but don't we expect her to? And yes, the \"support the troops\" bit was nauseating, but once again, it's trendy. All in all, if you've nothing better to do, give this a watch."
