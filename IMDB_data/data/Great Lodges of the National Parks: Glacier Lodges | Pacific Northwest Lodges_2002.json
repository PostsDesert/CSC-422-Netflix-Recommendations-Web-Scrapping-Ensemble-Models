        "reviewBody": "\"Great Lodges of the National Parks\" is a short series by Oregon Public Television about some of our great lodges. However, despite the title, they are not all in national parks but also in national forests and national monuments--all government owned, though the hotels are run by private companies. All are found in the western United States, by the way.\n\nThe show consists of several lodges highlighted per episode. In some, they show several lodges per park, others just one. The history of these places is discussed, there are LOTS of interviews with folks who work there and there are tons of old photos--all accompanied by majestic music. The bottom line is that the films are very enjoyable--quite beautiful and they really make you want to pack your bags and see these wonderful places yourself. Very well made.",
