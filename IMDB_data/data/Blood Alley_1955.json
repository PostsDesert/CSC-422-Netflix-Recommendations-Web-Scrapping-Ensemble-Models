The Rooster Coburn ones are a couple! I don't watch a movie for the technical mistakes or say who was miscast! If I really like one it becomes a \"favourite\" and may be brought out fairly often! This is one of my very \"favourites\"! I can't really tell you why, maybe it's the idea of a whole village escaping from Red China, plausible or not! I love happy endings!! Maybe it's because I'm an old fart of 80! Don't give me violence or a lot of bed hopping that's not for me or 4 letter words either! I didn't hear a single one! I would like to point out that Amoy is on the coast of China.",
