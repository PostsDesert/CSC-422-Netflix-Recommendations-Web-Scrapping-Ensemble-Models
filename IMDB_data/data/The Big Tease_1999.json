Ferguson is quite funny and Drew Carey turns up as himself in a rather likable cameo.\n\nOverall this is nothing particularly special, stuff like this has been done before, but anyone who likes sweet-natured comedies should definitely see this. There isn't a cruel piece of celluloid around this movie!\n\nI'd give it about 3.5/5 stars."
