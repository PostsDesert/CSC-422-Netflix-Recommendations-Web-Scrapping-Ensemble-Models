        "reviewBody": "I agree with everyone else, this movie was not a comedy; not even a black comedy. Maybe if it was categorized as a DRAMA, it may have got better reviews or any reviews at all. But the movie wasn't all that bad, I'll admit that the acting wasn't to great, but for what the had to do it was alright. Maybe its the director telling them what to do and they have to act to the best of their ability. Some of the casting choices weren't the best choices. John Ritter as the bad guy just didn't seem to fit. And the the movie info describing the actor playing Jack as a former \"womanizer\", I didn't see that at all. But the choices for Andrew J. Ferchland as Sam and Nick Roth for Charlie were great. Andrew looks like that small kid, not popular but not unpopular, always having to get straight A's for his parents, and he would look up to someone older who is the complete opposite of him. That opposite person is Charlie, not that great of an actor but got the slacker walk and attitude down perfect. He reminds me of my friend Ed, totally slacker and totally hot.",
