For some reason I never had the first one, and the second one even though I had it on VHS I don't recall ever seeing it, maybe I watched it one time and found it boring so I never watched it again.\n\nThis movie is pretty silly, but I think it is pretty funny, specially Rogers, Queen Uberta and Zelda, for some reason I find them hilarious. It is just so dumb when Zelda disguises herself as a german maid(?) and Rogers falls stupidily in love with her, and when she leaves he goes insane and sings a song which along with Zelda's song I think are the best ones.\n\nI really like that they cut down on the animals because they are a bit annoying and in the first one they give them too much screen time, in here they give them what they truly deserve.\n\nThe whole talent show thing is so silly but funny, specially Uberta with the whole tango thing.\n\nIt's basically an alternative version of the second one, but does it a lot better.",
