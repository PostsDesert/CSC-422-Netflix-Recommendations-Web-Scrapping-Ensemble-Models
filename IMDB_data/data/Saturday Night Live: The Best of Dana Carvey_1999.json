I mean, anytime you put the great Adam Sandler with others like Kevin Nealon or the late great Chris Farley, you've got a great film. SNL is a fantastic show, but it will never be as good as it was when the amazing Adam was on the show. Look especially for the skits The Herlihy Boy, Lunchlady Land, Adam as Bruce Springsteen, and various Operaman songs.This video is a definite keeper! Its fantastic and so is Adam Sandler !!!!!!! :-)"
