One of their bombs has become sentient and is busy contemplating the nature of existence.\n\nThe effects are OK, and who would have thought the beach ball would become the inspriration for the movie Alien. \n\nOver all one of the great classics of science fiction and of low budget film making. \n\nI heard of this movie a long time ago and it took me over 10 years before I finally found it in my local video shop. Great and amazing movie.\n\nWhat will bomb number 20 do, now it is intelligent...watch the film and find out."
