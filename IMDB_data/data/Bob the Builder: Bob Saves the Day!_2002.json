Much less annoying than, say, Barney or those Tinkly Winklies or whatever.\n\nThe kids really enjoyed it. The car puppets were really well done, and the sets. The music was not the greatest. Acting? Who knows? It's hard to judge someone inside a huge fake head or truck on their acting chops in a kids show.\n\nThe main thing is, the kids enjoyed it almost all the way through and that's who it's for."
