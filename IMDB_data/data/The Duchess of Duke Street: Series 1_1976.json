        "reviewBody": "This extraordinary series, so greatly loved by Britons, deserves a new generation to view and be mesmerized by the wonderful acting, writing, direction, and costumes. It is still compelling 25 years after it was made and still ranks as one of the most superb examples of what truly grand television can be. Most of the show feels as if you are sitting front-row in a theatre with the actors within inches of your seat but occasionally the production ventures outside when, perhaps, it starts waxing a tad towards \"drawing room soap opera.\" Still, trust me, this series, and its stalwartly resilient characters, will become forever etched in your heart, as they have in mine.\n\nWhen you are finished with this series, it is truly like losing a good friend. You are more than sad to see it go and lament the loss of anything else to watch. (Yes, there's always \"Upstairs, Downstairs,\" but, for my money, the Duchess has more beauty, comedy and heartwrenching drama than the \"Upstairs\" gang could even contemplate!)"
