        "reviewBody": "Rene Clement's \"Plein soleil\" offers a young Alain Delon as Tom Ripley, a character known to more recent audiences as the hero of the Anthony Mingella 1999 \"The Talented Mr. Ripley.\" It is nice to note that both films hold their own well, with the Mingella providing more character and background information than the Clement version.\n\nDelon, who was to become a favorite actor of Visconti and other fine French and Italian directors, renders a skillful performance, along with Maurice Ronet as Phillipe Greenleaf (known as \"Dickie\" in the later Mingella opus).\n\n Clement keeps the camera focused on the handsome M. Delon (as did Visconti) with stark closeups to show detailed emotional reactions. Delon manages to rise to the challenge in subtle ways, and to project a fully realized character. While Clement fails to provide much background as to why this character acts the way he does, Delon's photogenic countenance somewhat overcomes this void by masking it with personality and charm. \n\n We can be thankful to Martin Scorcese for the fine reprint of this memorable French thriller, known in the UK and USA as \"Purple Noon.\"",
