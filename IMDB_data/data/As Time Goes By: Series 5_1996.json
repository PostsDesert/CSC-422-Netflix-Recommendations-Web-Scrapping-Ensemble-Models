Quinn and the group land in New Spain where Daelin is working as a maid. The group has to move fast before they are deported to Canada. The next world, Daelin is in an abusive marriage and Quinn reconnects her with the Quinn of this world living in Seattle. Next, the group lands in a world where time is going backward for them. They attempt to save Detective Daelin's life, after being accused of killing her, in a public park. This was an interesting and unexpected episode. It seemed like the universe wanted Quinn to help Daelin in these three worlds. I enjoyed the movements between worlds. This is one of the best episodes of the series.",
