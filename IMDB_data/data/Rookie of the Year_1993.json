However, I realize many adults did dream of such things when they were children, and that is why \"Rookie of the Year\" may surprise some adults.\n\n The plot is childish, of course, and the acting -- apart from Daniel Stern and an unbilled cameo from John Candy -- is not Oscar-worthy. Still, it's worth a few bucks, and may transport adults back to their memories and make them fantasize more than children. \n\n I don't like this film a whole lot, but it's just one of those films that when you see it on TV, you just...watch it! Hard to explain. It's like some cosmic force draws you to it. I think it could be the worst film in the world and I'd still have to watch it every time it's on.\n\n I give \"Rookie of the Year\" 3/5 stars. Not great, and not even that good, but there's just something about it..."
