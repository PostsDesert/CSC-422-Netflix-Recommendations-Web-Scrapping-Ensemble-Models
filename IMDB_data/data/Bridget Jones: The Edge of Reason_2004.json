My Mum loved it, and when the DVD for Bridget Jones:The Edge Of Reason came out on DVD, she went i bought it right away. So, without much hope or agenda, I decided to watch it.\n\nThis film is absolutely AWFUL. The story bares no resemblance to the book, and the story was unbelievable. Poor acting all around. Why didn't they get the director from the first film back? She was marginally better.\n\nDo yourself a favor, and just read the book, which is actually witty and well-written."
