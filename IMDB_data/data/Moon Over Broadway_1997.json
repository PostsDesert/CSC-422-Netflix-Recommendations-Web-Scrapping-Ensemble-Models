        "reviewBody": "All sorts of drama unfolds within this film. Diva-esque actresses, lying producers, inept writers....Basically, it's your average Broadway show. There are some amazingly revealing moments here. At one point, Thom Moore, the director of Moon Over Buffalo criticizes Carol Burnett...She nods and accepts the criticism, but you can see the hurt in her eyes. I think Burnett comes out as the heroine of this film. One night in Boston, the set breaks down and she goes out to entertain the audience by answering questions about her life and so forth. An excellent film that is really really hard to find!",
