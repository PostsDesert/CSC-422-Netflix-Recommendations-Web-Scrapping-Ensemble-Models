Now, several gruesome deaths may be linked to this past event.\n\nTHE BEAST WITHIN is packed with bloody violence and murder while Michael works his way through the town's populace. However, this movie is most memorable for its final transformation scene, when Michael's head blows up like a flesh balloon. It's suitably nauseating, and makes the viewer's skin crawl!\n\nCo-stars L.Q. Jones as -what else- the sheriff, and R.G. Armstrong in an uncharacteristically non-grumpy role as the town doctor..."
