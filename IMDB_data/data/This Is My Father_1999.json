With a career span of 30 years and some 300+ productions, Putch carved out a little piece of Americana that touched many lives. With contributions from well known actors who performed there: Jean Stapleton (Putch's wife), Sada Thompson, John Ritter, Lee Meriwether, Shirley Jones. You may never have heard of him, but his impact was huge as evidenced by the testimony and recollections of the dozens of colleagues that contributed to this biography. Extensive use of super-8 sound footage of Putch and TV interviews ensures that the audience understands just who this P.T. Barnum of the theater really was.",
