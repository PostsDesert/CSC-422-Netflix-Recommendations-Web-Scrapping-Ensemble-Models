        "reviewBody": "Before Sunset is one of those movies, you either love, or you hate.\n\nPersonally, I loved it.\n\nNow, I recommend watching \"Before Sunrise\" first, however it isn't necessary. Before Sunset does a good job of reviewing what had happened, therefore if you decide to watch it Before watching \"Sunrise\" you have nothing to worry about.\n\nSome scenes are extremely well done. The characters are picture perfect, and the movie itself, is breathtaking. The aura of the movie is so spectacular, that it will inspire young directors out there, to pick up their video cameras are start filming.\n\nAn 80 minute movie, about two lovable characters and what they have to say, may sound boring. But the way it's done in Before Sunset, will sweep this impression right off your feet. \n\nJulie and Ethan play two of the most honest and true characters I have ever seen, they are known as Jesse and Celine. And while much of the credit must go to the characters themselves, you musn't forget the actor and actress who played them.\n\nJulie is perfect as Celine. The young french actress is so natural in front of the camera. Definitely, has potential. \n\nEthan is also very very honest, he seems so comfortable character that that you forget your watching a movie, and not a home-made video.\n\nBoth play with such honest expression, and such trueness, that they are so natural, Before Sunset becomes no longer a movie. It feels as if you are eavesdropping on two extremely developed people. It's such an intimate environment, that you never want to leave.\n\nBefore Sunset... 9.901/10*****",
