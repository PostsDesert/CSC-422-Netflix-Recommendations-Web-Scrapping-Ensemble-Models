        "reviewBody": "I'm always looking for a hidden gem, something I haven't seen before that hasn't been hyped to death on the internet. This film by William Peter Blatty (writer of The Exorcist) might be such a gem. I certainly never heard of it before. I was intrigued by the title and the cover (an astronaut on the moon with Jesus on a crucifix...what on earth could this be about?). This is the plot synopis from IMDb: 'A new commanding officer arrives at a remote castle serving as an insane asylum for crazy and AWOL U.S. Army soldiers where he attempts to rehabilitate them by allowing them to live out their crazy fantasies while combating his own long-suppressed insanity.' Sounds good to me. First of, the dialogue of these insane people is written brilliantly. The actors really go all the way in portraying these nut jobs. It's really funny to watch. But the film is a mix of a lot of different styles. It might start out as a comedy, it also contains horror like elements, drama, surrealistic and tragic parts. It's best not to know to much about this movie beforehand. So just check it out. You might not love it, maybe even hate it but it certainly will be like no other film you've seen before and in these times of cookie cutter productions that is a welcome relief.",
