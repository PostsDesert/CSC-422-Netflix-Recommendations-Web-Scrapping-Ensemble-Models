And that is the fact that the show creates an unrealistic image, and you don't have to be a brittish teenager to realise this. I mean, though most of the script is well written, and the humor is good, the writers would really have us believe that in the two seasons, depicting two high-school terms, placed in Great Britain, IT ONLY RAINED ONCE??!? I just don't buy that :)).\n\nGreat show otherwise!",
