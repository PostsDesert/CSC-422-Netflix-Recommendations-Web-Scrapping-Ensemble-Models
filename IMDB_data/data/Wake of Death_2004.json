        "reviewBody": "I'll be the first to admit that the super butt kicking action was not the only thing I appreciated in Jean-Claude Van Damme's films back in the day. His own butt was an excellent plus. Timecop and Cyborg? I was there. I tried to hang on after that but... JCVD twins, Dennis Rodman, science gone bad? It was all too cartoony and the action wasn't enough to hold my interest. I turned my attention East and... Salvation! The wonders of Hong Kong film.\n\nLooking to pack a recent weekend with as much action and gunplay possible, I found \"Wake of Death\" and decided to give JCVD another try. I'm glad I did as I found it to be a fine film. It doesn't have the American film clichés - a hero with a heart of gold, selflessly protecting orphans and widows, while throwing off quippy one-liners and never sustaining anything more than a few strategically placed scratches.\n\nThis is a man with a questionable and likely criminal past, but we're not back storied into seeing how he is really just a misunderstood hero. It is up to the viewer to make their own judgment about this man and his actions. This film is not for those who like their action mindless.\n\nI agree with all the comments about Jean-Claude's acting skills  he has definitely earned to communicate emotion and real character depth. He is a long way from the stone-faced Muscles from Brussels.\n\nThis woman gives the film 2 thumbs up! Now go kick some ass!",
