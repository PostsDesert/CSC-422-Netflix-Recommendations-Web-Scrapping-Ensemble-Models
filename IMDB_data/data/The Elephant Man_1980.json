John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins are simple incredible, and this movie is just filled with unforgettable scenes....\n\n but like some people have mentioned here before, it is an incredibly hard movie to watch, especially after you realize what a sweet, kind, smart and innocent man John Merrick was, it is often painful to watch the way he's treated by some people, and like Hopkins says after he sees him for the first time \"I pray to god that he's an idiot\", sadly, he is everything but that...\n\n10/10, no question",
