Between the two you get everything you need to know about korn from 1994-2000. the dvd also includes many hours of bonus footage, which is strewn across horror-movie-like interactive menus. there is content that can only be unlocked by entering codes into the switchboard. this dvd is a must-have for any korn fan. while the menus may get sort of confusing at first, you get really used to it.",
