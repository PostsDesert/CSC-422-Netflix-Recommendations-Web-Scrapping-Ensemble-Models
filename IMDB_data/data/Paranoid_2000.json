It did run a little long..but maintaining your interest for about the middle 3o mins and a slighty good ending which left you with the feeling that the movie was semi-good. Alba wasn't really good ... I agree that it looked like she was constipated with the acting she was portraying. final grade 5 out of 10. I mean dam it has a 3.2 right now... i really doubt it deserves that.",
