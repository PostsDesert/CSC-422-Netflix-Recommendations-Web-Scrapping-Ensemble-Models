        "reviewBody": "\"Cesar et Rosalie\" is about a love triangle between Rosalie (Romy Schneider), Cesar (Yves Montand) and David (Sami Frey). Claude Sautet would revisit the theme of a love triangle in his later film \"Un coeur en hiver\" (1992). In this review I will compare these two films.\n\nLets start with a comparison of the two men. In \"Un coeur en hiver\" the difference was introvert versus extrovert. We see the same difference in \"Cesare et Rosalie\", Cesar being the extravert one and David the introvert. This distinction is in \"Cesar et Rosalie\" however of secondary importance. More important is that Cesar is the businessman and David is the creative artist. If the link between the two distinctions is logical is for everyone to decide. I would rather expect that the creative one would also be extravert and the other way round.\n\nThe role of the woman is very different between the two films. In \"Un coeur en hiver\" Camille (Emmanuelle Beart) has a clear preference for one of the men. In \"Cesar et Rosalie\" Rosalie cannot choose. She likes / loves both of them. Her perfect lover would be the combination of Cesar and David.\n\nThe most surprising element of the film is the effect the behaviour of the woman has on the realtionship between the men. In \"Un coeur en hiver\" the love triangle creates tension between the two friends. Also in \"Cesar et Rosalie\" the two men (and especially Cesar) see the other one initially as an opponent. When they realise that Rosalie is never gonna choose between them a friendship gradually emerses.\n\n\"Cesar et Rosalie\" is extremely well acted, at least by Yves Montand and Romy Schneider. Sami Frey remains somewhat behind. His introverted character maybe difficult to play, but in some scenes David seemed a fassion doll to me.\n\nIn love Rosalie is a very independent woman. When it comes to housekeeping however we see how much the genderroles have changed since the 70's. When Cesar and his friends are having a poker evening Rosalie becomes the waitress and when David and his colleagues are working Rosalie becomes the coffee lady. In both instances without a sign of protest.",
