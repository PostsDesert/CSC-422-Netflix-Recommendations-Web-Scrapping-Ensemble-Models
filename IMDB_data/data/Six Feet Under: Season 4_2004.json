Even so it is an interesting sight to see six feet under playing at such a large venue compared to the usual dinge ridden holes they usually dominate. I would have liked to see them play \"when skin turns blue\" but you win some u lose some. Over all it was a great waist of about 50 minutes of my time and id gladly do it again, its more fun with company but check it out either way.",
