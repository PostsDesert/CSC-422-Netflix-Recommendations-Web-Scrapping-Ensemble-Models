        "reviewBody": "I saw this film from the library. I loved it. This is a Dean Jones and \"Herbie\" flick. But this Herbie which I am talking about is his dog, not his car. Ellen Janov portrayed the teenage daughter, Helen Bolton. Kurt Russell did a really good part as Ronnie Gardner, Helen Bolton's boyfriend. Dean Jones is really fun to watch. He portrays Fred Bolton, who works for a pharmaceutical company. Aspercel is the name of the horse. I love the setting of this film. Like all Disney Classic live movies, I find this one enjoyable. I've always loved Dean Jones and Kurt Russell. Suzy Clemens, portrayed by Diane Baker is the equestrian instructor. She teaches how to ride a horse. If you see this movie, you'll be entertained.",
