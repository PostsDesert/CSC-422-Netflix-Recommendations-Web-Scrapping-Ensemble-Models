        "reviewBody": "This movie is nothing more than a pile of unconnected and hideously awful musical numbers with small bits of badly-written dialogue and no plot whatsoever. It really is a boring watch, particularly with Jim Carrey playing a howlingly unfunny straight character and, let's face it, playing straight characters is hardly how he earned his fame. The only possibly endearing quality of this mindless waste of film is simply that it was Carrey's first leading role, and with this as his starting block, it's incredible that he got where he is today. If you have a yearning desire to see this movie, I would first advise seeing the world's most eminent psychologist.",
