        "reviewBody": "The basic story of \"Thirdspace\" is rather straight and simple, it could have been told in the time span of a regular B5 episode without being hasty. So, what makes \"Thirdspace\" interesting to watch, if you like this kind of sci-fi movie, more than the story or the not-too-overwhelming quality of acting, is its strong symphonic side - the synthesis of (CGI) images and Franke's score into a \"space symphony\" sometimes even resembling \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\". It's not as elegant, though. \"Thirdspace\" is faster and somehow rougher, there is less sheer grandeur (well, it's a TV movie), but still... one can enjoy much of it indeed, literally, as a moving picture with music. What I also would like to mention, though, is Patricia Tallman's performance - distinctly more inspired and refined than what we saw in the preceding B5 episodes.",
