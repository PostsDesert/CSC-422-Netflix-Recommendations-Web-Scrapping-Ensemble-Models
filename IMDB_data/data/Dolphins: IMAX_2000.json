        "reviewBody": "2000's 'Dolphins' is one of several documentary short films presented in IMAX. These short films are mostly quite interesting, but their overall quality is most worthwhile if flawed. The effects have also varied. The subject matter for 'Dolphins' immediately fascinated, dolphins are wonderful animals (same with many marine animals) and underwater while a familiar location in nature documentaries is so beautiful and mysterious with many layers. Plus Pierce Brosnan sounded like a great choice for narrator.\n\n'Dolphins' is absolutely wonderful and lived up to high expectations. Of the IMAX documentaries, it is to me definitely one of the best and one of the few that was nearly perfect. When it comes to dolphin documentaries, of which there are quite a few and all are worth watching, 'Dolphins' is somewhere near the top and the most comprehensive. . It clearly knows what its target audience is and does its utmost best at and succeeds in meeting what is needed to keep them interested.\n\nMy only issue really with 'Dolphins', and this is actually common with the IMAX documentaries, is the length as it does feel too short. With a lot of content, this could very comfortably have been 20 minutes longer perhaps which would have given the viewer more time to take in the information and also learn more.\n\nEverything else is great to fantastic. It looks fabulous, with beautiful yet unforgiving underwater scenery and especially the photography that leaves one in awe at its best. While there are plenty of cute and playful moments, one is reminded that there is danger and adversity in these beautiful creatures' lives. The messaging is honest and important to address, and isn't laid on too thick which is always a potential danger for messaging.\n\nThe music, with an accessible style, is relaxing in some parts while having some edge in other parts. The dolphins are absolutely adorable, look amazing, are inspiring and are very easy to root for, their behaviours are fascinating to see and never get old. A lot is learnt about them and the information is not lacking in depth, too humanised, over-dramatised and well backed up.\n\nWhen it comes to the information, it is very educational and the narration entertains and informs without preachiness or being gimmicky. Any familiar content is approached freshly, and in a way that will captivate and never disturb kids while not being cookie cutter. Brosnan's narration is soothing and silky smooth, just perfect for this type of documentary.\n\nIn conclusion, great. 9/10.",
