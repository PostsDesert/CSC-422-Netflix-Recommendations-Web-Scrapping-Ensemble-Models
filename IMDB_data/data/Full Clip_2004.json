        "reviewBody": "This movie is basically like a 90 minute music video I like rap, gangster action movies, and it has all of the above. For some reason, someone thinks, if they can sing/rap, then i guess the can act. Thats like letting your psychiatrist take the place of your surgeon and do open heart surgery because they're both doctors.\n\nIt has lots of action, which is good. The music is good if you like rap. It even has a decent plot. However, it has some of the worst acting I've seen since hitmans run(search it on IMDb lol). I'm sure full clip has more of a budget than hitmans run, and it is definitely better.\n\nJust don't watch this movie expecting a great movie. Like i said its more like a music video. If you can find a trailer I'm sure you can see some of the bad acting in it.\n\nIf you REALLY like rap movies, then you would probably enjoy this. Another movie like this, Never Die Alone with DMX(not that good but better than this) might be an alternative suggestion. It has better acting but is kind of strange.",
