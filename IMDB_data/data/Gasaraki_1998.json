        "reviewBody": "I've seen about the first 12 episodes. At first it was bizarre & disconnected, then overly technical. They have looong speeches about how the robots work, with no real purpose. I got the box set for Christmas, so I plan to finish it, but I end up doing Sudoku the entire time. The only remotely interesting parts deal with the various political plots & assassinations, but those are few & far between. The three distinct plot lines have absolutely no relation to each other, and now there appear to be clone things or something that is not even explained or relevant. The voice acting is terrible - it is more suited to a comedy than a drama."
