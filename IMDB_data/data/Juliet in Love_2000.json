        "reviewBody": "Sandra Ng plays Judy, a divorced woman who has had a mastectomy who lives with her aged grandfather and works as a restaurant hostess. Francis Ng (as far as I know, no relation) plays Jordon, a small time hood who always seems to be in debt. His boss gets stabbed by his wife and Jordon is asked to take care of his infant son. Judy gets involved, as Jordon helped her and her grandfather when her grandfather was hit by a car and they were together in hospital. The story is best when it focuses on Judy and Jordon with the baby. You see happiness in Judy's life and that makes this a warm, touching film. Less compelling are the violent aspects of this film, however essential they are due to Jordon's character. Sandra Ng as I've so far seen her has never done straight romance but, like every other role I've seen her play, is great in it. You see the disappointment in life in her face, its a very compelling portrayal. Francis Ng is also very good, he is very believable. It is a film which could make you misty, but it is not an outright tearjerker. The two leads, Sandra and Francis Ng, make this worth watching. Thats an endorsement for giving this film a try.",
