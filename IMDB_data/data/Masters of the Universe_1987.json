Okay, exaggeration, but come on, the plot, script, and acting are nowhere near the level of a decent, \"real\" movie. It makes \"Batman and Robin\" look good!!\n\nThe comparison to \"Beastmaster 2\" in the sarcastic comment below is accurate. It's just as bad in terms of plot/acting/script, and it actually makes the same mistake: setting most of the action on Earth rather than in the fantasy atmosphere of the original. By this one action, they take everything that made the cartoon exciting to kids and flush it down the toilet.\n\nA real stinker!!"
