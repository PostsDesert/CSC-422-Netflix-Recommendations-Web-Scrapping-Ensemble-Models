        "reviewBody": "Based on the swedish movie \"En man som heter Ove (A Man Called Ove)\" from 2015.\n\nThis movie is almost an exact replica of the original. Almost same scenes, dialogs.\n\nFor some reason, U. S. remakes of European movies are made almost identical to the original. Maybe that is an European clause to be able to make a remake.\n\nStill, Tom Hanks does what he does best: Entertain. And the supporting cast such as Mexican actress Mariana Treviño and Mexican actor Manuel Garcia-Rulfo do a great job, too. Specially Mariana, which even steals some of the scenes with her acting.\n\nOne of the few remakes that are enjoyable to watch.",
