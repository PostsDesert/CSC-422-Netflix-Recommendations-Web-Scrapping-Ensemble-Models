        "reviewBody": "Greedy is an adorable and totally '90s dysfunctional family comedy. Nowadays, those types of movies are either too quirky to be funny or too dramatic to be considered comedies. Gone are the nineties, the golden age of modern cinema! Thankfully, there are rentals, so you can rent wonderful flicks like My Cousin Vinny and Greedy-both directed by Jonathan Lynn-and remember the wonderful decade.\n\nIn the story, Kirk Douglas is the elderly and extremely wealthy patriarch of a pretty heartless family, including Ed Begley Jr., Phil Hartman, Bob Balaban, Mary Ellen Trainor, and Siobhan Fallon. No one likes each other, or him, but they're all sucking up to him in hopes that they'll be remembered in his will. In comes a distant relative with ulterior motives, Michael J. Fox, and a nurse who spends more time in a bikini than actually caretaking, Olivia d'Abo, and the family gets even more greedy and impatient! Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel's script is quick and hilarious, like two hours of verbal slapstick. Everyone feeds off each other brilliantly, and it's a laugh-a-minute as you watch the family tear each other apart. Light-hearted and silly, it's perfect for an afternoon movie day with your siblings-if you get along-or even a fun date night if you and your sweetie pie like comedies! Give the trailer a watch; if you're laughing in the two minutes, you'll love the full two hours.",
