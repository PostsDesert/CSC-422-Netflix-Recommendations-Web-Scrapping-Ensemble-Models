        "reviewBody": "I started watching Lorna Doone simply by coming across it on cable television. It had some beautiful scenery, and some good acting, especially the lead character of John Ridd (Richard Coyle)and Lorna Doone (Amelia Warner). Amelia Warner was exceptionally beautiful as Lorna Doone, and John Ridd played out his character of the handsome and honest farm boy who let nothing stand between him and his long love of Lorna Doone. These kind of movies I enjoy, as it places more emphasis on acting and development of the characters coming to life, then a movie with a bunch of special effects. There was plenty of action, to help frame the time period and create the havoc that possibly represented the time period. Costume department did a fair job, at least with the soldiers and lead characters. This movie hit my pleasure receptors in a subtle and unexpected way. Maybe it was looking at beautiful Amelia Warner, that kept me from changing channels. It is a beautiful setting and gave me the same sort of feeling that a movie like \"My Secret Garden\" did. I liked it quite a bit, and yet, can not explain why--precisely."
