        "reviewBody": "Since i bought this DVD i have to admit i have been watching it once and again.You can't find any boring moment in this new RCHP concert. Songs such as Universally Speaking,Otherside or Don't forget me sounds even better than in their original releases.Frusciante's guitar is absolutely magic in Throw away your television or the now classic Give it away.Anthony Kiedis sings even better than the old days and Flea makes the humorous line adding his magical bass play too.The rhythm section by Mr Chad Smith is gorgeous too making one of the best faithful drummers in the RCHP history.People from all ages will find this DVD very entertained and showing one more time that rock and harmony has always been compatible.The Red Hot Chili Peppers are without a doubt the best band for me actually and this dvd can confirm it.One more thing...don't lose the intro by Flea and Frusciante in Californication...John Frusciante is by far the best guitarist in all music history along with Jimi Hendrix...of course it's only my opinion."
