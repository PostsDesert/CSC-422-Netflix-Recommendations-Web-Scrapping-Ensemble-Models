        "reviewBody": "Another Comden-Green triumph! Although it may not be as good as \"Singin' In The Rain\", it's truly a masterpiece that no home should be with out!\n\nJules Munshin is energetic in the role of Ozzie! Gene Kelly plays the part of the lovesick Gabey absolutely perfect! And although I am a die hard Kelly fan, I must say that the best male performance given in this film was from Ol' Blue Eyes himself, Mr. Frank Sinatra! In the role of Chip, he brings a certain innocence as well as that sailor spunk and vitality! And the three of them crooning songs such as \"New York, New York\", \"Let's Go To My Place\" and \"On The Town\" is absolutely wonderful (especially Kelly and Sinatra)!\n\nAnn Miller is fantastic as the leggy anthropologist, Claire! She brings a lot of zest to her role! (It's hilarious to hear her refer to Ozzie as \"Specimen\"!) Vera-Ellen also is WONDERFUL in the role of Ivy, or \"Miss Turnstiles\"! She is a highly underrated actress... and her dancing is truly DIVINE! However, another highly underated actress is Betty Garrett, who portrays the female cabbie, Hildie! She makes the role zippy and sassy... and she and Chip singing \"Let's Go To My Place\" is an absolute knee-slapper that will have you laughing and singing with it every time! Alice Pearce is also rather funny as Hildie's roomate, Lucy Shmeeler.\n\nI recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of musicals, especially the older ones, such as \"An American In Paris\", \"Singin' In The Rain\" and \"Take Me Out To The Ballgame.\" This carefree frolic of a film will leave you laughing and singing for days!"
