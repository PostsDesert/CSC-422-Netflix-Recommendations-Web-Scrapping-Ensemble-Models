        "reviewBody": "-NO SPOILERS HEREIN (COULD THERE BE ANY?)- Being a huge admirer of Pearl Jam´s inventive and professional way of creating music, the awesome \"Touring Band 2000\" DVD was a real blast to me. The band turned out to be one of the best live acts ever to be witnessed. But recently I went to buy the new one- PJ live at the Garden. And it came to beat Touring Band in eyery aspect. Most important to me: The feeling was all right. In 190(!) minutes, the guys create an atmosphere of \"Why the hell have all the other people been there and not me?\". The music is just the way any music should be: handcrafted and professional (My personal favourite: The distinct and gripping \"crown of thorns\"). You get all the rockers and all the \"ballads\" and they´re gonna blow you away... And Ed Vedder is a great entertainer by not trying to be one. It´s real hard to describe the experience of watching a great concert like this one, so go buy and see it yourself. No Question: 10/10",
