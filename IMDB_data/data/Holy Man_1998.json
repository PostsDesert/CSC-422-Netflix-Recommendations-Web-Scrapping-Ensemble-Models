Is he a fraud or not? Jeff Goldblum is also excellent as \"Robert Ricky\" the cynical shopping channel executive. Watching how \"conformists\" react to an alternative lifestyle provides many laughs - watch out for the urineade scene. Every time this film is on, I find myself settling down to watch just a few minutes, then of course I end up watching it all. I have a feeling it has already joined Wayne's World as one of of those films where you lie in wait for your favourite scenes, then recite them! Definitely well worth watching especially if you have a quirky sense of humour. Fab."
