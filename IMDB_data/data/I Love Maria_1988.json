I Love Maria is a somewhat enjoyable sci fi action movie. I liked the action, robot designs, the cyberpunk elements were medium-high and Sally Yeh does an excellent job as a robot. Of course, as with HK movies of this nature, the comedic elements are a downfall. I prefer my HK movies to be dark and hateful so up yours. Plus the story was ridiculously stupid and most of the characters were unlikable. And I would like a lot more blood!!!! Urgh! In the end... The pros I mentioned were enough to keep me fat and happy like a mongoloid.",
