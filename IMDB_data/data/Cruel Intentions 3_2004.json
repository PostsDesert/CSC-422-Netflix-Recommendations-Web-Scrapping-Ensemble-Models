        "reviewBody": "I'm not sure why but I was just curious where they were taking the story of Cruel Intentions. Now if you haven't seen the first Cruel Intentions, I highly recommend it. Cruel Intentions 3 had a very good plot that could have worked and been a worthy sequel, but the way they went at it was all wrong. I wasn't impressed with how unrealistic it was with all these incredibly gorgeous and naive people around, I wasn't even sure if they were in high school or college since some of the students were engaged. It was just weird and unrealistic to me or well explained.\n\nCassidy and Jason are the new Katherine and Sebastian sort of speak. They are very much in love with each other but have a hate relationship as well, they play with each other constantly. Jason goes as far as to involve his new friend Patrick to play Katherine. But their intentions go cruel when they compete for taken ladies and who can do it first. Then they go for Cassidy in the ultimate bet of all and see who is the ultimate smooth operator.\n\nCruel Intentions 3, at least to me, was also very predictable, for me the ending wasn't that big of a shock. But I do like the plot a little bit, like I said, it had very good potential. Just unfortunately, the actors ruined it for me, not to mention how it was made, it just could have been better. But if you wanna check it out, I wouldn't stop you, just because I think it's best you judge for yourself on this film, if you're a Dawson's Creek fan, I think you just might like it.\n\n3/10",
