        "reviewBody": "I think the only way to describe this film is 'tits and guns'.\n\nMost of the film revolves around a strip club with the the larger-than-life Russian owner trying to put a deal together with an unstable half-japanese American lad to buy a mass of guns. The young lad gets frisky with a delicious Lorissa McComas pole dancer and all hell breaks loose. Coupled with the fact an undercover cop is lurking about and you have a recipe for one violent action scene after another.\n\nSpeaking of the fight scenes, these look lame compared with say a Jet Li/Jackie Chan movie. The long trench coat smacks of trying to be a Matrix copy but falling well, well short.\n\nAll in all, pretty average action thriller. 5/10"
