I was amazed that Miles (Grant Shaud) from Murphy Brown was here.\n\nThis is not a laugh out loud movie, but it is more a true to life account of men seeking women. \n\nIt cannot be categorized as a romantic movie nor a dramatic movie.\n\nEmotions will not be stirred watching this movie. This movie is more like reading a book where you ride through the journey of these three men. Will Ferrel, Grant Shaud and Anthony Palermo acted their part well.\n\nThe women however were bad, they fail to show emotion in the part given to them.\n\nIt is still worth watching from beginning to end.",
