Hard not to be moved by movies like this that essentially portray so beautifully a piece of a persons life. The music is great, a major discovery in my life and although seen it years ago i still treasure it as one of the reasons why i enjoy watching movies. Most of the actors of the movie did not have formal training and they manage to pull it together in a way that accomplished ones would have real trouble to do so. One of those movies that reinstate your faith in the homelessness of the good quality cinema NOT TO BE MISSED",
