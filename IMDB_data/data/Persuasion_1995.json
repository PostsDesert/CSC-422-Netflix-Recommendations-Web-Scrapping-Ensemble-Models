        "reviewBody": "This is the quintessential adaptation of Jane Austen's \"Persuasion\". The story of second chances for a young attachment to be re-kindled after 8 years separation.\n\nThe novel is beautifully rendered from start to finish. There is no inaccuracy, save maybe in the description of who is \"sandy haired\" and who is not. Mrs. Clay, Mrs. Smith... every character comes to life as if taken right off the page. At first, I didn't imagine Anne Elliot and Frederick Wentworth as the figures of Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds but they inhabit those characters so fully that I was quickly carried away to the world of the novel. Newer adaptations don't come close to the charm, wit and tender feelings of Jane Austen's Persuasion. I don't know why they would even try after seeing this.\n\nI was shocked to find that there was no synopsis in this IMDB entry. There were no pictures and no reviews. It was as if it had been erased from recorded memory. AND YET\n\nIf you are familiar with the novel, you will find this adaptation perfection! Prepare to be enchanted.",
