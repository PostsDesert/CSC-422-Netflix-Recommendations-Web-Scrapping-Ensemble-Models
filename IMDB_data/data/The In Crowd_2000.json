        "reviewBody": "The In Crowd is your basic teen thriller with lots of trashy girls and bad lines & acting and a mediocre script, but it was tolerable. Actually, it was more than tolerable, it was actually fairly good, not the acting, by any stretch of the imagination, but it served its purpose. In my opinion, it's a great movie to watch on a slow/rainy weekend evening. I went into this film with little to no expectations and ended up being pleasantly surprised. I was sure by the reviews that it would be terrible, instead I found myself thoroughly satisfied. While TIC is no \"Cruel Intentions\", it's of the same genre. Spoiled rich kids, doing bad things to each other and sucking in the lowly outsider in the process.\n\n\"In Crowd\" has the same atmosphere and draw as any soap opera today, but the cheesy drama of soaps seems to translate well to a certain niche, but it DOES have a niche. Expect nothing more than a two hour version of \"All My Children\" and you won't end this film angry. I say give it a chance. If anything it'll end up on your guilty pleasures list.",
