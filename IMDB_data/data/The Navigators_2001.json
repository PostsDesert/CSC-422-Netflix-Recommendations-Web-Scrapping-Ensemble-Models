        "reviewBody": "I was lucky to see during the festival of Venice in Milan this very recent film from the good \"social\" director Ken Loach.\n\n A group of friends in 1995 work in the Yorkshire for the ex-state owned: British Rail, which meanwhile has been completely fragmented in a tremendous number of small private companies that compete one against the other in order to be more competitive and gain the different bids. This situation leads the whole structure of each private company to a very profitable organisation offering a very poor service that has to save money from any single item of the fixed/variable costs structure of the economic statement.\n\nLoach this time points out the lost of the social benefits of the labour class in a blackmail black and white situation where, if they want to get the job, they have to leave with these conditions which do not guarantee any type of social and physical safety to the worker.\n\n It is not by chance that England has been the frame of several train accidents during the last years.\n\n Unions are getting weaker and weaker and the so called \"trouble makers\" are led to leave the companies. The whole film is nicely viewed with some very fine, pretty uncommon in previous Loach's films, British humour. The scene where the supervisor has to read to the workers the message from the top management of productivity and their new rights is hilarious and superbly performed.\n\n Rating: 6/10",
