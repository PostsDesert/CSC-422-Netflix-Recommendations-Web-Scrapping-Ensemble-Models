Any movie has some merits, either it's a bit artsy, with nice angles and colors and characters, or it's so bad it's funny (read Schwarzeneggers movies), or it's a touching story, or it's at least something. This movie was really nothing. It's pretty much the worst movie I've ever seen. No, wait! I lied. It IS the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad movies.\n\nStay away from this, unless your prepared for something spectacularly bad, so bad it ain't even funny anymore.\n\nI have to admit, the names got me kinda excited before I saw it, and the idea seemed fun. But don't let that fool you!",
