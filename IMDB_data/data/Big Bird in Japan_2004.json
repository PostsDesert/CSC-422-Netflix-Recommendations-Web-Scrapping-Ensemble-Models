I think if you have a strong interest on what's it like in being Tokyo Japan, as well as being into rock music then this is probably for you.\n\nAlthough you can tell this movie was made in an indie format, it still did a lot of justice with a great soundtrack, quirky characters, and pretty good cinematography. This movie showcases how far friendship and being goal orientated can take you when it comes to achieving something you cant see. I ONLY WISH they shot this movie on film, in my opinion it would of been 5x better because everything looks better on film when shooting in Tokyo. Phil really stole the show with his eccentric personality and optimism. Definitely won't mind watching this again. As a matter of fact, I\"ll watch it next month during my 14 hr flight to Japan lol.",
