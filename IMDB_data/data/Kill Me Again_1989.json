        "reviewBody": "John Dahl has mastered this genre almost effortlessly. \"Kill Me Again\" shows him in great form. The screen play by the director and David Warfield has all the makings of a film noir, which Mr. Dahl's executes beautifully.\n\nThe great coup for the director is the first rate performances he gets out of his cast. Val Kilmer, plays Jack Andrews, a Reno P.I., fighting some demons of his own. Andrews falls for the vixen Fay Forrester who comes knocking at his office door seeking to solve her problems, but instead, she uses Jack shamelessly.\n\nFay Forrester, the calculating dame of the story, has in turn double crossed her own partner Vince Miller, who doesn't give up trying to find what belongs to him. Jack Andrews in the end, proves he is more resourceful than Vince and Fay in an ironic twist at the end.\n\nVal Kilmer had one of the best opportunities of his career and he runs away with the movie. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, is excellent as the calculating Fay. Michael Madsen portrays yet another bad guy with great verve.\n\nMr. Dahl delivers a satisfying film that will not disappoint.",
