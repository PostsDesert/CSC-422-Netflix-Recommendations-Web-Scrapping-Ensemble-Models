Stay tuned for music, adventure, and fun and you might learn something before it's done so let's get started okay? HEY! HEY! HEY!\" \"Na na gonna have a good time! Na na gonna have a good time.\"\n\nThis was one of my favourite cartoons growing up and I still love it. :) I learned a lot from this show just be watching. Divorce, drugs, how to rescue someone after they've had a heart attack, and difficulties in being a young mother. Thanks Mr Cosby. I really had a good time watching this cartoon and good luck with the Fat Albert movie. :)",
