I laughed out loud in several spots, and was extrememly pleasantly surprised to see such good acting. Most of all by Miss Church. Who would think that someone with such stunning beauty and such a talented voice, could actually act.\n\nThe movie wasn't much of an inspiring romance, but it was a movie that was intedned to uplift you and inspire you to pursue your dreams. Entertaining to the last minute.",
