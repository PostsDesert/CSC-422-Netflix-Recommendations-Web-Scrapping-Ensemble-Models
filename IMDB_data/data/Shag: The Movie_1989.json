        "reviewBody": "Starring Phoebe Cates (Mrs. Kevin Kline, who knew?), as in \"what ever happened to\", and Bridget Fonda just as her career took off, Shag is sweet, warm, funny, nostalgic, and above all, wild. I saw a trailer for this on another DVD and added to my list of \"must haves.\" It was well worth it.\n\nCates is Carson McBride, about to marry stuffy Harley Ralston (Tyron Power, Jr.). Her best friends, played by Bridget Fonda, Annabeth Gish and Page Hannah (yup, Darryl's sister) surprise her with a weekend in Myrtle Beach as a last fling. Cates is funny enough, but Bridget simply overpowers the other female leads with her boundless charisma.\n\nThey meet a couple of local boys who change their lives and have one heck of good time in the process. Speaking of \"what ever happened to,\" Scott Coffey's Chip was the most enjoyable male character in the film, cute as a bug and delightfully innocent and whatever happened to him?\n\nToo many films of this genre are souless, heartless and mindless. This one is the rare exception, and gives you a chance to remember the discovery and adventure of coming of age.",
