I wasn't thrilled to be going to see a movie about a woman whose husband leaves her and she thus has to find herself.\n\nBut I was shocked when I saw the film and realized just how original it really is. There have been many films that have featured the same material as this film, however \"Living Out Loud\" is such an original take on a genre of film that has been overdone.\n\nQueen Latifah made her mark in quality acting with this film. In my opinion, she deserved the Oscar nomination more for this film than she did for \"Chicago\". She brought life to the film, and her characters story is a movie in itself.\n\nEven the cheesiest scene in the film is fun to watch. Holly Hunter begins to dance, while everyone dances in sequence to her behind her. However, this action fits in the film and with the character. For some reason it's beleiveable that she would actually do soemthing like this.\n\nI really do think people should go out and rent this little seen movie. It's worth the money and time."
