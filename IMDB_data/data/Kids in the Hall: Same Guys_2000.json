The skits performed are classics from the series show the chemistry the five have. Highlights include a lot of backstage moments, conversations, and so on. The scene with Conan and Andy is hilarious especially how they play off each other! Don't forget about Scott and his tribulations with his new \"pet\". \n\nThe DVD bonus features are great as well with typical KITH laced humor (Will somebody get laser eye surgery??). Also, this can be watched with audio commentary from the Kids and others: it's like watching a whole new movie!! Hey, this is the closest I'll get to seeing them live... until they perform again in New York City!!\n\nWhere is Paul Bellini???",
