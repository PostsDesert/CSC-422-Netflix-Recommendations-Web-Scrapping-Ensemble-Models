        "reviewBody": "I rented this movie not knowing what to expect. I'm a fan of Ben's from Farscape, so I was intrigued to see him in something else. As I expected, Ben did not disappoint. He brought some actual three dimensional life into a collection of banal characters.\n\nThe plot is nothing unusual, the type of film I'd expect to see in a movie-of-the-week format. There are intriguing elements, especially toward the end as the killer of the title comes closer to being exposed. I wasn't surprised by anything, but I liked Sam and Sara, so I was interested in the character development.\n\nC. Thomas Howell was unimpressive and I'd much rather have had someone more dynamic in the lead role. I'd say Ben, but my bias would show a little too much there. Sean Young-while she drives me nuts-was perfectly cast. I'm not sure I've ever seen Giancarlo Esposito in anything, but I really liked him in this film.\n\nThis was independently produced and while there are things about it I wasn't impressed with, all things considered it was a very polished film.",
