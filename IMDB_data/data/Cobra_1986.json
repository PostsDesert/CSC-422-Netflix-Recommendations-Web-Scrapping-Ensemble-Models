        "reviewBody": "An action film that borders on horror, with good actors and an atmosphere that is hard to achieve today.\n\nSylvester Stallone is a great choice for the role of a tough cop who is brutal towards criminals. Cobra despises crime and journalists, plays rough and does not forgive anyone.\n\nToday, it is almost impossible to make a film like this, with such a great character and a vicious action full of bloodshed. The film is extremely entertaining, well directed, and the soundtrack is great.\n\nThe plot is simple, the villains are killing people and Cobra will stop them with all the means at his disposal, and that of course includes a large amount of extreme violence and bloodshed.\n\nThe soundtrack is a memorable, complete product of that time and fits the film perfectly.\n\nThe film looks like an interesting combination of action film with elements of slasher horror, although Cobra can definitely not be classified as horror, but as an action film that provides the viewer with a great amount of entertainment.\n\nAn underrated film that has definitely achieved cult status.",
