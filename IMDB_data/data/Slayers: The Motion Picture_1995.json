Dill Brand = Explosion Array, Dragon Slave spell was mixed up), and Lina's Seiyuu (voice actress) got kinda annoying after a while, it was overall a solid effort and was another great success in a great series... Slayers!\n\nLisa Ortz (Lina's regular Seiyuu) was off recording Record Of Lodoss War - Chronicles of the Heroic Knight when this was being dubbed, so they had to get someone else. Naga's Seiyuu was, however, a true tribute to her Japanese voice!\n\nIf your looking for a good time with a couple of smart-ass gals who like to blow stuff up, welcome to Slayers!",
