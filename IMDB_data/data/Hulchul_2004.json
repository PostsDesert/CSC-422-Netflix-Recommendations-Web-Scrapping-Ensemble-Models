Starting with Akshay Khanna, Kareena Kapoor, Jackie Shroff, Suniel Shetty, Paresh Rawal, Amrish Puri, Arshad Warsi and many more.\n\nArshad Warsi is hilarious, he picks up where he left off in Munna Bhai MBBS. His character is well etched and has you laughing every time he's on the screen. Paresh Rawal is great as usual.\n\nAkshaye Kumar and Kareena Kapoor have great on screen chemistry its clearly visible in the song \"Rafta Rafta\". They fit their roles like a glove. Jackie Shroff and Suniel Shetty are good as usual.\n\nSadly, this is one of Amrish Puri's last performances, but he does a great job. He will be sorely missed and remembered forever!",
