I've finally gotten around to seeing it. What an impressive story. It's so sad that millions of people worldwide succumbed to AIDS while governments ignored it (in fact, interviewee Vito Russo died the year after the documentary's release). Part of what we can do is keep alive the memory of those who sought to raise the public's awareness. This documentary is part of that. Definitely see it.\n\nTo think that decades later, another authoritarian-minded celebrity-turned-demagogue used racism to get elected president and then ignored a pandemic.",
