At least this movie had more of a conclusion. I wish, however, that Miss Panabaker would have been in the sequel. There was nothing at all wrong with the new actress, but I would have rather seen the original actress play the part. I'd also like to know who played the new Sarah, and also I'd like to know who played the devilishly handsome Gabe. I don't think that I've ever seen either one of them before. Gail and Grant really pull off the chemistry just like in the first one. I definitely enjoyed the sequel more.",
