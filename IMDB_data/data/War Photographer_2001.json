The directer\n\nremains distant-letting Nachtway and others make the point. Ingenious use of multiple cameras as well as Nachtway's \"still\" black and white photos make this compelling to watch as well.\n\nRegardless of location or assignment this should be a primer for all working journalists as well as all journalism students."
