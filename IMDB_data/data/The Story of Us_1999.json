It is so close to reality that it is scary, I am only 16 so I haven't gone through this yet, however my parents have, and all I can say is that the movie was done so well I could relate to so many things in the movie.\n\nBruce and Michelle play the characters so well that it look like they are going through it as well.\n\nI would say that it is worth watching wether you know the situation or just want to watch the movie. It is touchy and funny at the same time.\n\nI wrote at the beginning that my parents went through the same things and I believe that the movie helped them to get through it and they are now doing a lot better and don't fight as often."
