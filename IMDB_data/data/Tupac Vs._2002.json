        "reviewBody": "Thug Angel is QD3's/Afeni/The Shakur Estate's attempt to turn Tupac's bad public image around and show you all the good things about him, hence, Thug Angel. What the media portrayed to you wasn't Tupac, he wasn't a gangsta, he wasn't a bad person. He loved the community, he loved kids, he even turned his car around driving to the airport because he heard about a little girl getting mauled by a dog on the radio and went to the hospital to offer his support, now that's being REAL. But.... other than that, Thug Angel fails as much as it succeeds. The young 17/18 year old Tupac interview is great, he's talking about changing the world, making it a better place, talking about giving women respect, once he even heard a guy call a woman the 'B word' as he says, but then the next interview he's high off weed and hennessy and eating pizza and cussing women, it's the total opposite of what he just said and often you will find the stories and messages contradicting themselves a lot. The interviews, especially Treach's camera/bedroom incident are HILARIOUS, this isn't as good as maybe Thug Immortal, but still as Afeni milks Tupac for all he's worth, they still have about 24 hours of footage left to milk out, so expect a few more videos to come.",
