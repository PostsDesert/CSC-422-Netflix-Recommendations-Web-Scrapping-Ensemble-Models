It's a great little story with plenty of laughs and lots of moments for kids to remember. I didn't know what to expect when I got this film since it's so far out of Olivier's native genre but he didn't disappoint me. Kids, horses, magic, whimsy. (And there's merit and moral mixed in there too.) I'm saving this one for the grandkids...Good going Olivier!",
