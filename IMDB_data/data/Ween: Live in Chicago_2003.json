        "reviewBody": "This is one of the finest live concert recordings I've ever seen as far as selection of music, quality of video, and shot selection goes. The concert contains all the usual songs you'd expect out of a major release from the Ween brothers, including Ocean Man, Transdermal Celebration, and Roses are Free, along with less popular songs that aren't as common in live performances, such as Spinal Meningitis Got me Down, Don't Laugh(I Love You), and a cover of Led Zeppelin's All My Love, among many others.\n\nThe shots are perfectly timed in a way rivaled by few other live DVDs. The camera cuts to Deaner's fantastic finger work during his solo's and alternates smoothly between members of the band and the crowd. The video and, more importantly, audio quality of the DVD is superb giving studio quality recordings.\n\nOverall, probably one of the finest concert DVDs out there, a must see for any Ween fan, casual or hardcore.",
