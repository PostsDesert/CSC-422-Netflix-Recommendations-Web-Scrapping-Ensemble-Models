        "reviewBody": "This is one of my favorite Chuck Norris movies. It has one of the best opening scenes ever with the silhouette of Chuck fighting an unknown adversary over a neon background. It looks fantastic and is such an innovative opening scene that really creates a cool atmosphere.\n\nJosh Randall (Chuck Norris) is an ex-Special Forces Vietnam veteran who ends up in Hong Kong after the war, eventually becoming the head of security for the Lucky Dragon Casino, run by fellow American expatriate, Sam Pascal. When Sam is killed by an unscrupulous rival, Josh goes on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge.The film is well paced with plenty of Chuck-related ass whupping and doesn't skimp on the violence either. When Chuck's girlfriend is murdered it's a pretty shocking scene, especially the bad guy's hair and mustache.\n\nOverall, Forced Vengeance is a fun Chuck Norris flick with plenty of fight scenes and action to keep action fans happy. Worth Watching...8 out of 10",
