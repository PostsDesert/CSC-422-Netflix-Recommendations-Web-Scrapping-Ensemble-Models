        "reviewBody": "This concert has to be seen to be believed. I bought this DVD knowing the one of my favourite guitarists - Ritchie Blackmore - was not in the band's lineup. Much to my surprise and enjoyment, I saw the new boy on the block belting out numbers as if he was part of the original lineup. Steve Morse has fitted in extremely well and plays off Jon Lord as if they had been together for a lifetime. All their favourites are included on this and each song is delivered with the force and energy of youthful rock band. My only disappointment is that Black Night is not on this DVD; the song that got me hooked on Purple back in 1972. Ian Gillan's voice is superb throughout, Roger Glover just great and Jon Lord's intro to Lazy is as fresh and driving as ever. Ian Paice like many older drummers simply get better with age and are able to go beyond beating time with the music - they are in fact part of the music. Given that these guys have been around for 30+ years, it is great to see them enjoying themselves on stage as they perform song after song from an era that was blacked out by sex, drugs and rock and roll. Because they enjoy themselves so much on stage here, the music flows effortlessly and the crowd appreciates this. A fine concert and played on 5.1 surround system places you \"in the crowd\". This one is a 10 for me.",
