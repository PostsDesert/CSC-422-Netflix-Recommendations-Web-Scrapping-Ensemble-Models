All the requisite elements work together so well here, it views almost as a documentary. Art direction, costuming, sets, photography, direction, script, acting, editing - everyone deserved an award. It's as nearly flawless a film as i've seen. Young adults will resonate deeply to its themes, but all adults will find much to savor.\n\nDemme deserves credit for infusing the potentially ho-hum tale of young grads gathering for their small-town high school reunion with a palpable tension that gives every development dramatic interest. Will violence erupt? Will some go to prison? Will lives be ruined? Will lovers truly find each other? How rich with dramatic possibility are the everyday moments of our lives! And how satisfying can be the rewards of just accepting the everyday prizes that come our way.",
