I watched the show afterwards and agreed that this was the greatest VT show.\n\nAllow me to put my own input on why. The movie's moral is about what it means to love. The Bible has many elements of love, and that's the main message(examples- Christ dying, 1 Corinthians 13). This is the best illustration of it.\n\nThe humor is great too. One example is Cavis tells he has something London has never seen before. Millward excitedly asks: \"You've got a monkey that can yodel?\" It's just a hilarious line. (And that's not what Cavis has.) The Moyer chase and ride to the church near the end is hilarious as well.\n\nThe music is catchy too, the song Plugged Up Love is one of my favorite Veggie Tales songs.\n\nGreat humor, catchy songs, and an important message. That's where Veggie Tales shines, and here's where it excels.",
