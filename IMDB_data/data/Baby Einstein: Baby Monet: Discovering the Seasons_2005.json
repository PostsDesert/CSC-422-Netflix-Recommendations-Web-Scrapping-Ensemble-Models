If I had to pick, this would be the one I like most. This is because it's really cute, fun, entertaining, and educational. Still, I think that all the Baby Einstein videos are really cute, fun, entertaining, and educational. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that the Baby Einstein company really knows how to reach a toddler's developing mind. Now, in conclusion, if you have children, nieces, or nephews, I strongly recommend this really cute, fun, entertaining, and educational video.",
