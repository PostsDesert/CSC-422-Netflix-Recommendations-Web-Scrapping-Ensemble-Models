Yes, some of the plot is a bit on the silly side. However, I think that on the balance, the movie works for what it is intended to be.\n\nI think that the film work with the wolverines is great and deserves respect. Outside of it being a feel-good family movie, \"Running Free\" is also a small work of education on, or at least a cursory introduction to, these often under-understood creatures. This film shows that there is obviously more to the fearsome \"Devil Bear\" than its general reputation would suggest. Writer/Director Steve Kroschel is known for his personal love and dedication to wolverines. I suspect that a movie of this sort would only be possible through the caring work and knowledge of such a person.",
