Argento uses quick edition, complex and original camera movements (as in the moment in which Keitel kills two detectives), and an extremely gloomy and unpleasant photography to accentuate the morbid climate that permeates most of his films. Even being violent and quite slow, \"Two Evil Eyes\" will please the horror fans, for being a show of impressive visual."
