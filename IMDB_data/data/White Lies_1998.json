Somehow, there are few really good movies that makes you think, often they're just too theatrical and shallow and doesn't seem real at all. Another great movie I'd like to recommend is 'a simple plan' with for example Bridget Fonda and Bill Paxton. If you haven't seen 'White lies': give it a try! And Sarah Polley was really really great."
