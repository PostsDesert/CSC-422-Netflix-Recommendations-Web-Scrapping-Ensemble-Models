        "reviewBody": "Just finished seeing Triumph of the Spirit. What a sad, bleak, dark, and depressing film.\n\nThis was based on the true story of Greek Balkins Middleweight Champion Salamo Arouch who was undefeated before World War II. Once the Nazi army invades Greece, Arouch, his entire family, and all the Jews in Greece are shipped off to the Nazi death camp in Austwitz.\n\nWith-in moments, all the women in Arouch's family are murdered in the gas showers. He is forced with his family and brother to work at slave-labor. Arouch is brutalized by a camp Kapo who happens to be a professional boxer as well. In a brutal scene, Arouch and the Kapo have a fist fight with Arouch scoring a knockout and a Nazi camp guard finishes off the Kapo with a gun shot to the head. Arouch is then forced to box in the camp for the Nazi officers who bet on the \"boxing\" matches. Only problem, the losing boxer ends up the \"chimney stack\". \n\nA heart-wrenching and brutal story. Shocking to realize that not only did the Nazi murder, torture, starve and kill the inmates at Auswitz, but they also forced all the professional Jewish boxers to put on \"Galdiator\" matches for their entertainment.\n\nThe Triumph of The Spirt is a triumph of film-making. A very depressing one at that.",
