        "reviewBody": "I personally thought that this movie would be something like the old crap movies about a couple and then an extra-marital relationship that exists between the wife and a new man. The idea of SHABD is the same but hats off to the writer !!!! She has so marvelously crafted out a wonderful theme for the movie. It is so ....my ...a wonderful experience (minus Zayed) who really sucks with some cheap jokes!!! Shabd is about a writer (Sanjay Dutt) who tells his wife (Ash) that she should explore an extramarital relationship with a boy (Zayed Khan) because that will be the subject for his next novel.\n\nThis is just one dimension, not the entire film. It is not blatant as that. It is about a writer who is oscillating between his thoughts and the real world. It is about the way he lives his life and what he thinks about it. It is about how the mind works and how it spills over to reality --how it governs the matters of heart. It is very complex.\n\nLeena Yadav, the director, has chosen all aspects of life. She has spoken through the visuals as well.\n\nOn the whole watch the movie for its great script, wonderful songs and visuals that are truly awesome !!! Watch it also for Aishwarya , for she has not looked so graceful after TAAL happened to her. Don't hate me if you feel bored when Zayed enters..well he is not too long...um...I will not spoil the interest by revealing the climax !!! Watch out for a commendable work of art and literature....\n\nI give it a 8/10.",
