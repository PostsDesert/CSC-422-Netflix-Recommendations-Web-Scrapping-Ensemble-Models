I actually saw KISS in concert at VFL Park in Melbournes outer suburbs in 1980. That KISS Concert was Awesome But the EAGLES FAREWELL 1 was better, and this DVD is that Concert. Buy it you wont regret it. Mate Cant Wait For The Farewell 2 Tour:-) I did not know I was an Eagles Fan. Through work a guy rang me and asked if I wanted Tickets to the Eagles concert that night. \"Yeah I'LL have 4\" He Says \"Mate this is the Eagles. How Many\" Stupid Me \" Four will do Mate\" He says \"OKAY THEN!!!!!! pick em up at the box office\" We get there and we are 20 Rows, in front, from the stage and here are these 4 dudes singing songs I knew by heart. almost 3hrs and not a bad note or key. Freekin AWESOME",
