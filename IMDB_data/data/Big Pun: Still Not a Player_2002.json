        "reviewBody": "10 out of 10, excellent movie after Big Pun became Immortal. It's kind of strange how a past speaking up coming Latin Rapper went platinum once and then past away.\n\nIf Big Pun were still alive, G-Unit would have their hands full. And a Latin Rapper that went platinum before is not going to take trash from some rapper that thinks that they're gangster. Terror Squad runs things, even if Big Pun is not around.\n\nNow about the movie, this movie is Rated R, even if you don't see the logo below. The kids, especially the Puerto Ricans that are very interested in this movie, you can watch it without your parents permission if you like, you'll like it later on and very soon, you might not watch it again.\n\nThis documentary profiles the life and career of the chart-topping Latino rapper Christopher \"Big Punisher\" Rios, who past away in February 7 of 2000 at the age of 28. Hear from those closest to him how he overcame tough years growing up in the Bronx to climb to the top of the hip-hop world, only to succumb to complications from a lifelong battle with his weight.\n\nThis movie was never in theaters, and it was commercialized few times on television. Now the Movie is on Sale on DVD in local Video Stores and it's not on a VHS (bootleged VHS of \"Still Not A Player\" are only sold in The Bronx, New York City, New York, USA) format because of the sales of DVDs.\n\nEven though Big Pun has moved on to another dimension surrounded by whiteness with dead notable rappers such as Eazy E, Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., Big L, D.O. Cannon (from Ja Rule and Irv Gottis group \"MURDER INC\"), and most recently Proof from D12 (which is a shame) other rappers carry out his legacy, freestyle rappers such as Frankie Cutlass from Harlem, Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA, Backland from Baltimore, Maryland, USA, and Big Will from Saint Louis, Missouri, USA.\n\nT-ANGEL.",
