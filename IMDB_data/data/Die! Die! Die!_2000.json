At least they are more believable, better acted and shorter than \"Error 2000\" - what an suitable name to this film. It's one big error from start to bitter ending - how did they fool so many good actors into this mess, beats me. The producers for sure must not have been short of cash... It even has taken five persons to create the story for this film. More the merrier isn't the case this time. Please, switch over to another channel. Now.",
