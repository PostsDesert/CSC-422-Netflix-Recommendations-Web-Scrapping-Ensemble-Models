        "reviewBody": "ONE NATION UNDER GOD highlights the thuggish nature of evangelical reasoning when sexual matters are investigated. The film examines Christian \"Cure\" Counseling which employ aversion therapy and brainwashing techniques that can change erotic behavior, but seem to have only marginal effect on sexual orientation. The jubilance and exultation of these \"former\" Gay and Lesbians all have a resoundingly false ring. However, it has only been since 1974 that the psychiatric community no longer classified homosexuality as a character disorder, and the theological mindset is very slow to change. The message of this documentary is clearly that ignorance and hatred within the evangelical movement perverts the fundamental message of Christianity. The New Good News For Modern Man now seems to be, \"We are all God's children except for those of us who are NOT\"!"
