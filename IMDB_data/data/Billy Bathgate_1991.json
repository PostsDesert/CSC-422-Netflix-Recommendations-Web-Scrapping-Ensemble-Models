        "reviewBody": "This film had some problems, but is still underrated. Hoffman is intense and frightening as Dutch Schultz and I can't believe he wasn't nominated for this. The lead kid, Loren Dean, simply has no acting talent whatsoever. Nicole Kidman is fetching as the spoiled, rich girl and Steven Hill is excellent. Robert Benton is a wonderful filmmaker and I rate this a 7 out of 10.\n\nThe novel is better than this, but there are wonderful scenes and even Bruce Willis is believable for the only time other than Pulp Fiction. I can't believe this bombed as it did, but I think in the future people will give a higher rating than they did at the time. One of Hoffman's best performances along with Midnight Cowboy and Straight Time.",
