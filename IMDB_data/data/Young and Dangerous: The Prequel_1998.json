While this was the last one they made, it takes place before the first YaD. I actually liked this movie the most out of any of them. I saw it after the first YAD, which was OK, but I watched this one, and it was everything that I hoped the first would be. YAD 1 basically skips how they became triad, but this one goes into a lot greater detail about what happened to them, and the choices they made that effected them in the rest of the series. I would actually suggest watching this one before any of the others, and of course watch them in order.",
