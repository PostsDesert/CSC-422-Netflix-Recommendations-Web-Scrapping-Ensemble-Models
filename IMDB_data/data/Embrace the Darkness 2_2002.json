        "reviewBody": "In this, the final part of the Embrace the Darkness trilogy, Jennifer is now played by Chelsea Blue, although in the credits she is Brooke Larele. Using Renee Rea again would have given the last two films a welcome consistency although it has to be said that Ms Larele does exude the growing stature and power of Jennifer compared to the novice vampire Jennifer in the second film and the soon-to-be vampire Jennifer (Madison Clark) of the first.\n\nIn the opening of this film we find Jennifer and Jack (Tristen Couer D'Alene, but credited as Tristen Edwards) hiding out in a run-down hotel where they exist by stealing blood bank samples. Jennifer finds that she can manage very well without Jack but on one of her nightly forays she is spotted by powerful businessman, Victor Chamberlain (Ty Winston) who senses that she has a power like no other vampire. She learns that Victor and his retinue are also vampires and slowly she is drawn into Victor's world, not realising that he has an ulterior motive for wanting her. They are drawn to each other but time is running out for Jennifer unless she discovers Victor's motives, and for Victor who needs her for his nefarious plans.\n\nThis film, like the first is more character-driven, unlike the second which is more for the sex and nudity brigade. Ty Winston really shines as the evil and duplicitous Victor Chamberlain and Brooke Larele gives a good performance as the vampire who is becoming more confident in her new existence. One weakness is Sean, (Glen Meadows) a newspaper reporter who, on this performance would never make it as a paparazzo. There are varied sex scenes throughout the film so there is no lacking on that score. An award of 5 stars seems reasonable.",
