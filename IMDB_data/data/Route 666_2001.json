ROUTE 666 is without a doubt one of the dumbest pieces of work I've ever seen. Rude and offensive, I'm so sick of movies where the \"good guys\" act worse than the supposed bad guys. Lou Diamond Phillips seems to be making a career out of playing uber-tough cops (BORING!) who don't seem to care about breaking the laws they're supposed to enforce (see \"24\" and the god-awful FIRST POWER, in which Phillips breaks into a person's house with no search warrant--his partner says, \"You can't do that!\" and Phillips replies, \"I can do anything I want!\" Nice hero, huh?). I actually wanted the asphalt zombies to kill the federal marshalls. Too bad they didn't finish the job. And L.D. Phillip's character is outraged at the murder of four psychotic killers, but treats his prisoner (a Mafia witness whose only crime is that he's trying to save his life by not testifying) like crap?\n\nAnd the strobing effect every time the zombies were on screen has got to be the most irritating visual horror effect since the rapid back-and-forth zooming in MAD DOCTOR OF BLOOD ISLAND. Oh, and shouldn't the jackhammer have made some noise? Those things are capable of blowing out eardrums, but this one sounded like a clicking pen.\n\nSomeone out there should apologize for this waste of celluloid."
