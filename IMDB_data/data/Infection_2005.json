It seems that a meteor has hit nearby, and something strange is going on as a result.\n\nUnfortunately, this setup lingers on and on. And on, as various people drive the same police car down the same long stretch of road!\n\nTo be fair, a couple of zombie-types do wander about, but they only last for about 10 seconds. There are few scares, and even fewer interesting plot developments. Most scenes are made up of lengthy shots of empty road with absolutely no action.\n\nAs one of the so-called \"found footage\" films, this movie could be used as evidence for why the entire sub-genre should be abolished..."
