I found myself wanting to get her next rock video, and not even knowing if she had one. If you are debating which coming of age girl movie, which music movie, which overcoming love flick to view . . . this is the premier choice. I thoroughly enjoyed this one from start to credits.\n\nThe ONLY sad point about this movie is that it is only available on VHS -- not DVD. :-( Enjoy"
