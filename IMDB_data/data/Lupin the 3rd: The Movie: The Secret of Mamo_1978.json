        "reviewBody": "Lupin III is Japan's longest running anime series, spawning five movies, three television series, annual Television specials which continue to this day and even a live-action movie. One of the films, \"Castle Of Cagliostro\", in fact, is considered an animation classic by most critics on both sides of the Pacific. However, before \"Cagliostro\" there was \"Mamo\". Mamo is based more on the traditional Lupin as created by manga artist Monkey Punch-so those who are used to the kind anti-hero in COC might be in for a slight shock. This Lupin is more of a womanizer and a trickster than Miyazaki's version. The plot doesn't flow as well as COC's, and is kind of drawn out with a couple false endings. The visuals aren't as good as COC either, with some rough-looking animation in spots and action scenes that don't flow as well. Anyway, it's still a good movie, especially for fans of Monkey Punch's take on the character(as opposed to Miyazaki) just overlong. A word to the wise though-the DVD doesn't have the Japanese track, something which some anime fans might not like. The dub is OK voice wise, but the script has obviously been rewritten slightly-something which becomes blatantly obvious when you hear, over a radio, George Bush and Boris Yeltsin chatting, something really out of place in a 1978 film...."
