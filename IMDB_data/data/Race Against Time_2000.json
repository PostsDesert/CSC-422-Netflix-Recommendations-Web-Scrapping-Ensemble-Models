Eric Roberts is a great actor but this one was really out there. The performances are really good and the story was ok but we really end up not caring about the movie or the people in it. I really mean that. Even the special effects could not save it? Oh well... I had high expectations with this flick but no cigar. Oh the story... wait a minute don't really waste your time... If you like Cary Elwes and Eric Roberts see it but if your not a fan of either just rent \"The Running Man\" with Arnold! Better movie and that's not saying much even though I liked that movie. Out of 4 stars I give it 1 1/2 stars."
