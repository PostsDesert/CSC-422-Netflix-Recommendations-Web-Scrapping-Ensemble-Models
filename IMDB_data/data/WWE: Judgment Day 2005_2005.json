        "reviewBody": "Smackdown delivers with Judgment Day! The PPV was pretty well done!! \n\nWe open up this show with: \n\n1- Charlie Haas & Hardcore Holly taking on MNM. A new hot duo! This was for the tag team golds. MNM retains with their pretty impressive double team move. Melina hot as always! Charlie Haas, underrated like always!! 7/10 \n\n2- Carlito Vs Big Show. A short match but entertaining... after the match, Morgan give Big Show an F-5, this was very impressive!! 6/10 \n\n3- Paul London Vs Chavo Guerrero. a very hot 15 min cruiser-weight title match, theses 2 wrestlers show why they should be on every event. Crowd was hot! 8/10 \n\n4- Booker T. Vs Kurt Angle, another very good match with a hot crowd. The wrestling was there and Angle is very good in his persona!! 9/10 \n\n5- Orlando Jordan Vs Heidenreich for the US Gold. Pretty boring match but Heidenreich make me laugh, I actually dig his new gimmick a lot! He's funny, charismatic... OJ is... well... OJ! 2/10 \n\n6- Eddie Guerrero Vs Rey Mysterio... despite a DQ finish (but that was hot), the match was really interesting with Chavo trying to interfere! This was pure wrestling!!! 9/10 \n\n7- WWE TITLE MATCH!!! John Cena (c) Vs JBL... this was a sick sick match!!! We see tons of blood and some really good bumps!! Theses 2 work pretty well in gimmick match and it was an ''I QUIT MATCH'', a match that have a lot of history in this sport!!!\n\nBottom Line... another underrated PPV by the underrated brand sees as the second class. Everything was good. You have entertaining when it's a bad match like Orlando one and the other matches are really good!! You have to give this PPV a try, don't rant it... Buy the DVD!!",
