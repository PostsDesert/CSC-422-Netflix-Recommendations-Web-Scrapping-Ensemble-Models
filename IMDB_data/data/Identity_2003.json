One by one they begin to be killed...but by who and for what reason?\n\nThe set-up is neat (if predictable) and there's a great opening showing how the actions of one of them (Amanda Peet) inadvertantly causes some serious damage for the others. There also is some great acting by Peet, John C. McGinley and Ray Liotta (who REALLY chews the scenery). There are also some moments that will make you jump and there are two neat twists at the end.\n\nThe only bad things about this movie is some clumsy exposition (John Cusack tells his whole life story while photographing a corpse), some truly bad lines and a surprisingly lousy performance by Cusack. What's happened to him? He looks worn-out and haggard in this film.\n\nHowever, these are minor problems and the film is well worth seeing and keeps you guessing about what's going on till the last moment. Worth catching.\n\nWARNING: This film is NOT for children!",
