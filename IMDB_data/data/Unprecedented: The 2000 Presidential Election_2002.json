This lack of action alone speaks volumes.\n\nCommon sense tells me that the 2000 election was clearly not what it seemed, that's for sure.\n\nThere's a lot of information on this US Government web site. Those of you getting your news from TV, radio and magazines will be surprised at what is revealed there\n\nThe United States Commission on Civil Rights seems to have investigated this matter rather thoroughly. Are there any other government agencies printing any other version of the story ?"
