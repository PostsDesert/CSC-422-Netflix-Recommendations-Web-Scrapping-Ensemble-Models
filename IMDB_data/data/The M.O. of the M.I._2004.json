I've heard and read about so many people bitching and moaning at how much they dislike this movie as compared to pitch black, but honestly i think this one is fantastic (although undeniably pitch black was much better).\n\nIts basically the character Riddick from the pitch black movie in his own adventure fighting monsters , avoiding authorities and escaping a prison . in a nutshell thats what it is and thats what you get . people complained that this one strives too far from the feeling that the original pitch black gave us , but thats not necessarily a bad thing is it ? its a new take on an expanded universe created for the soul purpose of telling the story of this character.\n\nIf you love pitch black then there's no reason you shouldn't lover this one. I feel it necessary to say that Vin Diesel being nominated for worst actor in this movie is scandalous. Top film bad critics - end of story!"
