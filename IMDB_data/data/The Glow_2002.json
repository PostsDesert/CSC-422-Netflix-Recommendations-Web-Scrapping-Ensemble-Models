Tenants begin \"moving out\" unexpectedly. Wife gets suspicious...\n\nIs there anyone who can't write the script from here on out?\n\nNot really bad, despite its predictability. It was nice to see Dean Cain again in his post- \"Lois and Clark\" career. And it's always good to see old-timers like Hal Linden and Dina Merrill.\n\nNothing special, but an okay time-waster if there's nothing else on.",
