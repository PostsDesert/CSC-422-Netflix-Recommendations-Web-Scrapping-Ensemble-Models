That's not always the best way to do it, but in this case, it was. The Eighteenth Angel is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The plot turns are exquisite, and i just loved it when I discovered the meaning of the title. I don't want to give away to much but I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it."
