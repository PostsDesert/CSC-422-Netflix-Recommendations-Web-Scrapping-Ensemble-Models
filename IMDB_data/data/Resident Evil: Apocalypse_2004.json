        "reviewBody": "The movie concerns about living dead in Racoon City where a lethal virus outbreaks and it infiltrates into human body creating the Zombies after to bite themselves . Milla Jovovich escapes and she's helped by an action woman (Sienna Guillory) and a soldier (Oded Feher) and a journalist(Sandrine Holt). They have to confront several Zombies starving of meat and a nasty and evil Corporation chief.\n\nThe film begins as ¨Omega man¨ movie , as a city without people , totally uninhabited . After that , Milla Jovovich will find a motley group at a church where she'll fight against weird creatures and later with Zombies that a mutant virus has transformed into flesh eating . It's a good horror film , made in fast moving and is neither boring , nor tiring , but entertaining . From the beginning until the end the action pace is nonstop . In the picture there are action, terror, suspense , creepy atmosphere and a little bit of gore . The motion picture takes parts of ¨Alien¨ and ¨Dawn of the dead¨ and of course : ¨Resident Evil I¨ . Special effects ,FX , are first rate, they have been made by make-up and computer generator.\n\nThe film is based on a popular video game and obtained a lot of success such as the first part . The yarn will appeal to terror, gore and video games fans. Rating : 6,5/10 . Above average .",
