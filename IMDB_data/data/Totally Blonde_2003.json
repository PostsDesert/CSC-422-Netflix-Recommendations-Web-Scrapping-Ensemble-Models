        "reviewBody": "Alright, the only reason I watched this was Krista Allen otherwise I was expecting a horrible movie and it was pretty bad. Allen looks hot but I prefer her non-blonde look and her dress sense in 'Totally Blonde' was awful. I'll start with the good points of the movie. It features some very nice solo numbers by Michael Bublé. The chemistry between Bublé and Allen isn't lacking either. For a débutant, Bublé is okay but at times he's a bit too weepy. Krita Allen grossly overacts with the exception of a very few scenes and sadly, she doesn't go nude in this one. Maeve Quinlan is decent and the rest of the cast is unbearable. The atrocious writing is extremely shoddy and even amateurs can do a better job. I hope the director has now chosen a different career path more suitable for him because film-making is not for him. He should be banned. This is one hell of a crappy movie with only one or two good points. If you want to watch Krista's beauty, go get her Emmanuelle series but if you want to see her act, then try to catch the last several episodes of 'What About Brian'. For Michael Bublé's singing, his CDs are available. Avoid this junk."
