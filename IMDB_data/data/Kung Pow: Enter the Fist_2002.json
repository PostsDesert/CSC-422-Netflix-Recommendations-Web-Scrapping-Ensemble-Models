Undefeated but broken, the Chosen One is raised by various rats and things in the valley and, as an adult he finds himself under constant attack from those that would seek to do the job they failed to do when he was a baby. Seeking help from the Master Tang's Crane school to hone his style and make him stronger, the countdown is on till a showdown between Master Pain and the Chosen One.\n\nIn case the title leaves you with any doubt that this is going to be a silly film, the opening scene features a terrible CGI baby fighting with a ninja master. This silly approach continues throughout and the entire thing is one big nonsense from start to finish. Mixing modern footage that is dubbed and excerpts from Hu He Shuang Xing, the approach is very simple but does produce some silly laughs. Too much of it is too puerile to appeal to a mass audience (that cow fight was just stupid and unfunny) but at times it is very funny just because it is so off the wall and has lots of lines that are unexpected.\n\nThe \"cast\" is naturally dominated by Oedekerk doing silly voices but it works surprisingly well. He is hardly Oscar Wilde but if you buy into the humour then he will do it for you. God help you if you don't want silly comedy though, because there isn't much else to be had in this film. Overall then nonsense Â– utter nonsense; but if you are in the mood for it, it does produce some good, if sporadic, laughs."
