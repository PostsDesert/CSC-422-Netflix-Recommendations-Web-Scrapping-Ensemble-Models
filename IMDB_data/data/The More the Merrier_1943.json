        "reviewBody": "I truly love this wonderful,endearing romantic comedy from Hollywood's golden age. It has a unique setting - Washington D.C. during the housing shortage caused by World War II, and gets great comic mileage out of the various problems caused by the situation. George Stevens handles it all superbly, but what you remember most are the three charming leads. Charles Coburn justifiedly won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his scene-stealing panache as the elderly Cupid who helps steer Jean Arthur and Joel McCrea towards love. McCrea was an unsung but marvelously effective leading man in the 30's and 40's - rather like Jeff Bridges has been in his career. He's very fine here, and also in the movies he made for Preston Sturges. And Jean Arthur is at her very best - another great who doesn't get enough respect nowadays. Its difficult not to fall in love with her in this film - even if you were blind, her voice alone would knock you off your feet! Its ridiculous that this was her only oscar nomination-but then she, along with Carole Lombard and Irene Dunne were Hollywood's screwball comedy queens, and Hollywood was too busy rewarding the likes of Greer Garson and Luise Rainer.",
