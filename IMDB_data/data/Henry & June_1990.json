I have to be honest and say that I can barely tolerate most Nick Shows. For \"movie night\" I told my son I'd watch this with him. OMG. I have to say I really enjoyed this show. I can't remember the last time a show made me laugh so hard I cried. It might be a corny movie/show, but it is very entertaining. Since I LOVE sarcasm, I think the superhero is HILARIOUS!! A few days before I'd just watched Batman and Robin with George Clooney. This show blew that Batman and the horrible script and acting out of the water.",
