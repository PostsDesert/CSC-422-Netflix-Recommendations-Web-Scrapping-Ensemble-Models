I'm even spreading the word to people I work with to get them interested in it! \n\nSecond, it's just that...it's a show! It's made for TV & ratings. Although, they do a great job of trying to hold true to most parts of history, they can't hold true to everything and expect EVERYONE to enjoy it. You're always going to have people over analyze things & pick out the problem areas but truth be told, it's a great show & well made!\n\nLast, maybe this gives you a better idea of just how much I enjoyed it.... I don't even care for western/Indian type movies/shows but I did this one. It's nice to see shows these days that aren't filled with profanity & sex but rather attempt to follow a life that some of us never knew. Seriously, at the end of the day, it was a \"feel good\" type of show & one I'm glad I took the time to watch!",
