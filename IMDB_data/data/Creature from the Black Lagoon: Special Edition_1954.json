        "reviewBody": "I really appreciate an intelligent script and this movie was no disappointment. Sure, it wasn't perfect and it wasn't scary at all (I write this some 50 years from when it was originally released), but it was pretty decent quality.\n\nThe story revolves around a scientific expedition looking for the rest of a hand-skeleton that was found next to a South American waterway. Their hunt leads them to the paradise-like 'Black Lagoon' area - and trouble with an unexpected creature encounter.\n\nNo doubt the movie was impressive when it came out, but for the viewer many decades later, it's a little dated. From the \"God created the heaven and the earth ...\" opener to the verbal comments which equate adult women to children, it shows it's age. Also, when the lead actress swims in the water, it's a little funny to see her swimming / depiction in 'water ballet' form - kind of representative of an idyllic 50's female icon.\n\nWhat really elevates this movie is the dialog and acting. Both are well done and believable. They give the movie a very serious tone and an air of intensity. I'm sure when it originally came out, this helped create a strong atmosphere ripe for fear and horror.\n\nFor the modern viewer, this film is pleasant viewing - a decent way to spend 79 minutes in classic 50's monster-movie mode."
