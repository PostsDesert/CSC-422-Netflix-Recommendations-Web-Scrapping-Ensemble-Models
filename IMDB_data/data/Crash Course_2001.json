        "reviewBody": "I really enjoyed this show. The school pressure storyline was good. The romance bits were a little less believable given that there appeared quite an age gap between ml and fl. The relationship between the brother and the boyfriend was also well done, but Aspergers no longer exists: everyone is now on the Autism spectrum. This was in no way a perfect drama (also some continuity problems) but something a little different and all the actors were great. If you are looking for something light to watch then I recommend it but you don't need to stay home for it. The thriller aspect was a little obvious but also enjoyable.",
