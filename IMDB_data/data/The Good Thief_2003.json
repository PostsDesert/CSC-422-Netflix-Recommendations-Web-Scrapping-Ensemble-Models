        "reviewBody": "This was a re-make of the 1955 film noir, \"Bob LeFlambeur,\" which I also own. That was black-and-white and made in France while this is 2002 movie in color with English-speaking actors.\n\nUsually I'll take the original over the re-make but not in this case....with one major consideration. In order to like this film, I had to play the DVD with the English subtitles on because many of the accents were just too tough to decipher and if you can't understand the dialog, it gets a bit frustrating. The story is confusing enough as it is, so, if you have a similar problem as I had, play this with the subtitles.\n\nIf there is such a thing as colorful film noir, this would be it, with many splashes of the neon nightlife of France, inside and outside. \n\nStory-wise, if you're confused you are not alone. After two viewings, I still haven't totally figured out the twist at the end. The dialog tries to be snappy mid-40s Raymond Chandler stuff and sometimes it's great, other times it's affected. Overall, however, it 's fun. Nick Nolte delivers most of the clever lines. The young girl in here, Nutsa Kukhianidze, is intriguing new face, as was the case with Isabelle Corey in \"Bob.\"\n\nThis movie gets a lot of negative reviews from professional critics. Don't trust them; give this a look.",
