        "reviewBody": "Yes, the production values of INCOGNITO (especially the gauzy photography) smack of \"B\" Level production, this film shines for a few reasons, most notably the peek into the world of Art, Art History and Art Forgery. Anyone who considers themselves curious about both Rembrandt, his place in the art world, and the art world's place in history will enjoy this movie. This movie's depiction of the steps in the creation of a counterfeit masterpiece are possibly the best half-hour of film I've ever seen. The performances are excellent, and it deserved better than Direct to Video. Especially good are the performances of Rod Steiger, Jason Patric and Irene Jacob.",
