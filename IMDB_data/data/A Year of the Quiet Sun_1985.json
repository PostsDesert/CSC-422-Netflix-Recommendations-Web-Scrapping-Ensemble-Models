        "reviewBody": "I needn't labour my reasons for admiring this magnificent work - the eloquent reviews already committed to this forum have intelligently and admiringly praised this great film for it's achievement in every department, and for it's quiet sublimity. I agree with every positive word written in this place.\n\n'A Year of the Quiet Sun' is indeed something special: It is a humanist treasure - beauty brought forth from the universal and horrific darkness of the 20th century, truly a sun painted to put back up into a ruined sky, to shore up the ruins of our benighted world, patching the gaping darkness of our fallen and threadbare souls. To call this a masterpiece would seem somehow as shocking as applause during a church service: It is a profound meditation on the fate of humanity, and as such it is beyond praise. It is that rare thing, an artifice that brings reality into sharp focus, and gives us back a little of our lost immortality. A breathtaking achievement. A film for the ages.\n\nEspecial thanks are due to Netflix, by the way, for the commendable and valuable 'season' of neglected Polish films they are presently curating (November 2019), of which 'A Year of the Quiet Sun' is the most remarkable amongst several wonderful productions. Netflix, in this willingness to feature what are usually dismissed by popular streaming services as 'art house' movies, and which are as carefully avoided by traditional broadcasters in this commercial milieu, is performing a very valuable cultural service.",
