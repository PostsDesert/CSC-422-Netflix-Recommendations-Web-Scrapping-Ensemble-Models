This film presents a phalanx of former CIA and diplomatic heavyweights who proceed to tear apart...shred by shred the misleading \"evidence\" -- the totally fabricated and false rationale for this totally unnecessary war. It is not very funny like F9/11..it is not investigative as is Outfoxed and WMD --the Danny Schecter film: Weapons of Mass Deception --this film just outlines and delienates,carefully and methodically, using REAL experts the deceit and deception --the lies that this \"adminstration\" have brought to bear to justify the unjustifiable --it is political, it is \"biased\" but, it is truthful because the people in it were observers (and, in some cases, participants) to the lies perpetuated on the \"american public\" ...how can we get people to see it? to be exposed to the truth of what has taken place and caused so much heartbreak and anxiety? See it and make others see it as well. ...this is very important",
