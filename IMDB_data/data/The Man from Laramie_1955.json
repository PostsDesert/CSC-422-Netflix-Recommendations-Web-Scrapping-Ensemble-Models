        "reviewBody": "I like Jimmy Stewart a lot, and like a vast majority of his movies, and when I saw that this was going to be on television I told yes I must see it. After seeing The Man from Laramie, I thought it wasn't absolutely outstanding but it was very good all the same. The story, about a man who seeks vengeance on the man who sold the guns that killed his brother, has its unfocused spots and while Cathy O'Donell looked lovely her acting wasn't that great at times, I found her somewhat bland. That said though, The Man from Laramie is beautifully made, the cinematography is crisp and the scenery is breathtaking. And George Duning's score is excellent, and the dialogue has some bite. Also there are some very good performances, Jimmy Stewart is excellent in the lead of Will Lockhart and Donald Crisp is brilliant as Alec Waggoman, who along with his sons played respectively by Arthur Kennedy and Alex Nicol dominate the action. Antony Mann's direction is tougher than most of the other psychological westerns that he directed, and here it works. Then there are some effective scenes such as when Will gets shot in the hand and the final shoot-out on the cliffs. Overall, not flawless but very satisfying western, telling of anguish and vengeance. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

        "description": "Anthony Mann's psychological revenge saga of Shakespearean proportions starring James Stewart\n\nHeld by many to be the pinnacle of the five Westerns they were teamed on, The Man from Laramie marked the final collaboration between director Anthony Mann and star James Stewart.\n \nStewart stars as a resolute vigilante, obsessed with finding the man responsible for his brother's death. Among the suspects are an arrogant cattle baron (Donald Crisp), his sadistic son (Alex Nicol) and his ranch foreman (Arthur Kennedy).\n \nA psychological revenge saga of Shakespearean proportions, and masterfully filmed in Cinemascope and Technicolor, The Man from Laramie is one of the most powerful dramas of the 1950s. The Masters of Cinema Series is proud to present it in a new 4K restoration in a Dual-Format edition for the first time in the UK.",
