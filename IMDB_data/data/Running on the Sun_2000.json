Why would anyone attempt to run 135 miles in 120 degree heat in the middle of the summer in Death Valley? This documentary takes you on this journey to show you what it's like and also gives us a chance to meet some of these people and find out what makes them tick. It's a powerful film to watch and recommended to anyone who is curious about what makes a masochist tick. Be warned, this is a difficult film to watch. All said, I'm glad I only watched the film and didn't have to participate in it!",
