He is not in much of the movie, but what he is in took my breath away. More people should really acknowledge that he has so much more to offer than Lenny Kosnowski (Laverne and Shirley) and David St. Hubbins (Spinal Tap). He is a magnificent actor, and one of my very favorites. His performance in \"Across the Moon\" should have gotten much more recognition than it ever did. If you have not seen this movie, rent it, just to see his few lines, and his few scenes. All together, this movie has a nice feel to it, and women would definitely be able to identify with the situations and the characters.",
