This is one of those movies. It is fun inspite of all the \"trashines\". The acting is excellent throughout the cast. It is enjoyable to see the locations used that are easily recognizable for any one who has been to Ft. Lauderdale. The movie has too many funny parts to list, and in the other reviews on this site many have been cited. I would like to add one. In the beginning when Chill Wills and Chief of Police talks to the assembled troopers about how to handle the invasion of the students. A real classic scene. I can't wait for this film to become available on DVD, having worn out my VHS copy. A really fun nostalgia movie"
