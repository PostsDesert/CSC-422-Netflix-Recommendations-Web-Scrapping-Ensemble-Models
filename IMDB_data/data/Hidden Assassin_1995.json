I didn't take this movie seriously, and I'll bet the actors had fun making this movie.\n\nThe scenery and location were very impressive, the interaction between the main characters was good, with a touch of (unintended?) comedy throughout. Some of the scenes were unbelievable, but that just added to the feeling that you couldn't take this seriously as an action-adventure movie. For example, how could Michael pass by all the security points, evil bad guys pursuing him unscathed? If it isn't taken seriously, well that's the fun of it.\n\nI had never seen Dolph Lundgren act before, and was comparing him to Arnold... both are hard workers.\n\nThe story line is this movie's weakest point, along with a few minor characters who obviously were put in the movie for appearance but no acting ability whatsoever.\n\nOverall, I liked it and after repeated viewings, I still enjoy it."
