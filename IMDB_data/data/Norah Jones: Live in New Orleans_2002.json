        "reviewBody": "Although young and pretty so she's nice to look at, this is another example of a DVD that really is a waste if you already own the CD with the same music. Norah is so young she really isn't much of a performer, nervous when she talks or tries to ad-lib anything. \n\nThus, after the first viewing, this isn't much more than a glorified CD. Neither her nor the drummer or guitarist in the small jazz combo are flashy enough to bring notice. In other words, none of the musicians are animated nor is there any noteworthy camera-work. It's mainly straight-on shots of Nora singing and playing the piano.\n\nIt's nice music and she has a calming, smooth voice but don't waste your money on this. Stick with the CD.",
