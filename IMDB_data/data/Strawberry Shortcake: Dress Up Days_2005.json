Don't wanna tell the plot so if you've been lookin' for it in here you're not gonna find it. It's about friendship basically. That's all I can give out. Sorry. I think it's really good, it has a good story line and fantastic music and girls and other characters are just so sweet and perfectly designed. Kinda hot I'd say...Well I'm 18 but I still find it one of the Best cartoons I have ever seen. Especially this episode. So for those who haven't watched it yet, I can say only : Go for it guys You'll love it too, for sure. And just DO NOT let anyone keep telling you \" Oh man c'mon this is just a silly fairy tale for kids, Lets watch football instead\" I can only provide you with the words of my recommendation... So this is definitely what you MUST see.... Cigi",
