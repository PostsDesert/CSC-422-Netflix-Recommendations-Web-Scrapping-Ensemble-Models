        "reviewBody": "Filmed on September 11 2001, the concert was meant to be, in Sting's words, \"a joyous occasion\", a live concert featuring re-interpretations of some of his best songs from his villa in Italy. As the events of that day unfolded, the performance was clearly not going to go ahead as planned.\n\nMost of the world's top performers, scheduled for concerts across the globe (quite rightly) cancelled their shows, the idea of fun and entertainment on that day became totally irrelevant.\n\nSting's scheduled performance was due to be a live webcast and clearly a lot of time and effort had been invested in it. Perhaps a day earlier, the show would have been quickly shelved. A day late, perhaps called off altogether.\n\n Sting clearly struggles with his thoughts in the beginning, but after a nervous start with the haunting 'Fragile', he finds himself carried by the music, his mood shifts slightly as does that of the band, some members smiling, with the audience clearly warming to the strangely uplifting spirit of the night.",
