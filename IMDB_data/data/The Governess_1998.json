The entire film is beautiful to watch, the story palpably intelligent and erotic. The characters rich and spellbinding. I was enraptured by the first 5 minutes and the story never let me down. Tom Wilkinson was excellent as was Harriet Walter. A definite must see for lovers of intelligent period pieces. Very reminiscent visually of Jane Campion's \"The Portrait of a Lady\" and Shekhar Kapur's \"Elizabeth.\" Too bad the film (and especially Driver's performance) got so little attention when it was released this summer. Rent it, and then decide how you feel."
