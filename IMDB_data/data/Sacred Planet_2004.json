And with the narration, which is done by Academy Award winner Robert Redford, you will be heart felt by the end credits. Disney Pictures has come up with a new way to present new Documentaries, much like they had done back in the 1950's. Recently, they have done more documentaries, such as Ghosts of the Abyss and Aliens of the Deep. Most of them have gained much critical acclaim, and met with great response from viewers alike. And at 40 minutes, this Picturesque documentary feature will capture you forever, and deserves the 10 of 10 rating.",
