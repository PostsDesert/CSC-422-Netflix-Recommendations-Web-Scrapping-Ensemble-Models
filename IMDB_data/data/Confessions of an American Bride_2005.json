Muriel's Wedding, directed by Hogan, with the great Toni Collette. And My Best Friend's Wedding with Hollywood princess, Julia Roberts. And then this TV movie that has a shining Shannon Elizabeth, that proves the audience a good range of acting.\n\nThe film's finest and funniest moments come from the whole crazy rush on the wedding's arrangements. Just shows how a pain in the ass is to get married! The two families becoming relatives now thing, was very funny too.\n\nShannon Elizabeth and her \"fianc√©e\" Eddie McClintock show some sparks and very good chemistry. Good acting and good writing make it up for a predictable, conventional premise in a well-directed film that is so self-aware and not serious that is really a delight of charming and funny moments. A good one.\n\n7/10",
