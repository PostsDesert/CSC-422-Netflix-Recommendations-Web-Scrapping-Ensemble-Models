I looked forward to it every Friday night.\n\nPersonally I never cared for any of the reunion shows, though the theater movies without the original cast were pretty funny.\n\nIt would have been better if they had just left the Brady Bunch in 1974 the way I remember it.\n\nSome things are better left the way they are.",
