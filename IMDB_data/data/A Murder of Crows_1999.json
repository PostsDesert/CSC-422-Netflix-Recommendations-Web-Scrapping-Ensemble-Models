        "reviewBody": "Jane Halifax is returning home, to the nice village in a countryside, where her mother lives, and it's not all well there, as one could expect. Before her return, a bad car accident had occurred.\n\nThe atmosphere then is as strange and thrilling as you could feel, when you are the only one normal person in a house of fools! This atmosphere cumulates and escalates just before the end. When Halifax is leaving the village at the ending, the sun shines again, people are smiling, and all is nice just as you imagine countryside...\n\nI saw it again, that a psychopathic person is always very intelligent and it's really hard to reveal him/her (it was a narcissistic girl in this case). Such person proves its intelligence by controlling other people, awaiting hard rivals only to cope, fight and win. But Halifax with her psychology skills and intuition was too hard nut.\n\nA very good show from the series, again. I give it 8 of 10 stars for perfect psychology, ignoring some little flaws (it's TV show only, so I think it cannot be technically so shining as regular movie, don't you?...).",
