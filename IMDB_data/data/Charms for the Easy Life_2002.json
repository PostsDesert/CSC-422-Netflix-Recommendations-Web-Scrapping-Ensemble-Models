        "reviewBody": "Joan Micklin Silver, the director of this film has done better before. She must have been attracted to the material. The novel was much better, as usually is the case when the adaptation is from a book and not from a short story.\n\nThe film is pleasant to watch, but it seems hollow in parts. Charlie Kate was a determined woman; she gets rid of a husband that is a waste and sets up a domestic practice to help everyone that is sick. She had an innate sense for healing, as the man who she saves from being lynched tells her at the beginning of the film.\n\nGena Rowlands is good as the indomitable Charlie Kate. When she has good material, this actress excels. The surprise of the film is without a doubt, Mimi Rogers, an actress that is far superior than others of her generation. Unfortunately, she doesn't get what she deserves. The rest of the cast is good too.\n\nThis is a nostalgic look of America in the early 40s.",
