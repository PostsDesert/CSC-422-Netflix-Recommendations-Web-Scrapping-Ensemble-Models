That is, until Suzette decides to come visit Lavinia. Then, all bets are off. Big time.\n\nIf absolutely nothing else, \"The Banger Sisters\" shows that Goldie Hawn and Susan Sarandon still have the talent that they always had (of course, neither one ever lost talent). Geoffrey Rush has a great supporting role as uptight Harry Plummer, with some strange plans.\n\nI gotta say, autumn 2002 put an interesting spin on chick flicks, with \"The Banger Sisters\", \"Far from Heaven\" and \"The Hours\".",
