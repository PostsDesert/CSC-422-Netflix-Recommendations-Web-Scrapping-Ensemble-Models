        "reviewBody": "I have to give Erica Eleniac credit: she really is trying hard to shed her early career as 'eye candy' and take on more challenging and serious roles. Hollywood being what it is, she still spends a lot of time in this movie scantilly clad...but also delivers a performance of real depth as a party girl who married for money only to find herself trapped in a loveless marriage. When she starts to plot to have her husband killed, things start to go terribly wrong. The movie uses an unusual framing devise in having the action related in a series of flashbacks from the dead woman's diary as it is being read by her younger sister (also Eleniak). Paul Winfield also delivers a solid performance as an aging cop, somewhat similar to that of Gene Hackman's aging cop in the movie 'Falling Down'. While not exactly a masterpiece, and utilizing plot devises that have cropped up many times in other movies, the quality of the cast and the dead-on solid performance by Eleniak combine to lift this film over its B-movie cliches!Recomended"
