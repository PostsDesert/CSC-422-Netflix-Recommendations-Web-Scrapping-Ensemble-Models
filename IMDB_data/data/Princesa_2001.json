I disagree with one of the posters that it was sad. Yes, some things didn't work out, but the protagonist still moves on with a hope and a dream that is still in tack. Life is often not perfect, but still, there is beauty in it, just as the policeman said as he so tactfully took the protagonist down from a roof in Milan.",
