Where is the in depth information, history in details of these 'joints' and the origins and reasons for being? Why does the information that is in the doc drag on without added value; lack of creative editing. The interview set ups are as boring as can be with no variety. The audio from the interviews is average at best. One thing I give it, documentation of events/music is immediate and entertaining yet it, too, could have been judiciously edited down to the best and leave the rest on the floor. I am grateful for the documentation but bored with the presentation.",
