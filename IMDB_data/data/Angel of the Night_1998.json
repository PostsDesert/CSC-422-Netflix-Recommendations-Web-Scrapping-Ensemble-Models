It was so funny and to do, i won i price for best special Fx in Denmark when it came out many years ago. A lot of the things is done almost whit out any money in a simple way but i think that a lot of the scenes in the film is working so fine. I have been working on Shaky Gonzales other movies and we are having so much fun on the set doing these films. Shaky Gonzales Direktor on the movies is so good to worked with, he loves to blow things up, shoot outs, breakaway windows to jump through, bullet hits, stunts and so on, i love it to. So i can wait for the next movie to work on whit him",
