A few times it happens to be a really good movie.\n\n'Wisegirls' is an excellent depiction of a normal working life unaware of the actual dangers that fester inside. At first I, too, thought it was going to be a comedy, but was I suprised. Mira Sorvino is at her best as a quirky yet fiery young lady just trying to make ends meet in a legitimate establishment run by underworld factions. Arthur Nascarella shines as your typical cool yet vicious mob boss *Mr.* Santalino. And Mariah Carey...she can only get more and more beautiful (forgive me, she's always been my \"Vision of Love\") and she is truly a very good actress.\n\nI recommend this movie for those who enjoy action, drama, and lovely songstresses all together in one suprisingly good package."
