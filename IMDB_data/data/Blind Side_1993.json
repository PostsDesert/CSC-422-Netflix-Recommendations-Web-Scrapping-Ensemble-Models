Realizing that the person is deceased, and not wanting to try out the Mexican legal system, the couple skedaddles north of the border... pronto!\n\nOnce home, aside from their ailing consciences, all seems well. That is, until a man named Jake Shell (Rutger Hauer) enters their lives. BLIND SIDE is a story of guilt, giving way to anger, and finally terror, as the Kaines's find themselves in increasing peril from this bizarre, unhinged stranger who just might know about their crime. Hauer's banzai, over the top, bananas performance during the finale is priceless! Watch, and be astounded!..."
