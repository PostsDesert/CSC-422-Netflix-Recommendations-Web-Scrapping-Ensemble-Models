These are simply men and women trying to get along in a perverse world, to find love and peace in their lives. Well-written, smart, and uplifting though not in a gratuitous way, \"Love Stories\" is one of the best trilogy movies I've ever seen. Each segment is loosely tied into the other, and each segues into the another seamlessly, sort of like visiting a few of the folks on the block for an hour and a half. This is cable TV at its very finest.",
