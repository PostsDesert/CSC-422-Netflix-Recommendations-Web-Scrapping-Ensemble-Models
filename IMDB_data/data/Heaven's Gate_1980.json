It seems that much of the prejudice against the film was based upon its price tag (small by today's standards, when one thinks of the overrated \"Titanic\" and the deservedly hated \"Waterworld\") and some sort of animosity toward Cimono, certainly an imperfect person. I would, however, recommend the film -- it is certainly better than its reputation and is, if not a classic, certainly an honorable achievement."
