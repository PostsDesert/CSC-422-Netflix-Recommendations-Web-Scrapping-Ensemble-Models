        "reviewBody": "\"Clarissa Explains It All\" was a classic Nick show that aired in the early '90's. I remember watching it on SNICK when I was younger with my sister.\n\n\"Clarissa Explains It All\" told the story of Clarissa Darling, a young girl who wanted to be a journalist. She lived with her mom, dad, and her brother Ferguson. Her best friend was her neighbor, Sam, who came in through her window everyday. There was also her pet alligator Elvis.\n\nMy all time favorite episodes were \"Haunted House\" and \"Sam in Love\", though, all the episodes were classics. I also thought the acting in this show was very well done, including Melissa Joan Hart as Clarissa.\n\nI miss the days when Nick aired classic shows. I give \"Clarissa Explains It All\" 10/10 stars.",
