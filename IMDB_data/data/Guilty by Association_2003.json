Drugs?...Nothing...\n\nMorgan freeman should think before lending his name to these kind of films though he comes only in 4, 5 scenes.\n\nI had to fast forward (X16) for most of the scenes. \n\nThere is also a utterly indecent bed scenes and a cabaret which most of us would feel disgusting.\n\nI would rate a 1/10 for this movie.\n\n."
