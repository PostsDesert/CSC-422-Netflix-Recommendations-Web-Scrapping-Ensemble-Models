It is Authentic for all the actors, languages, costumes and the way of the Native American. It is the most enjoyable Family movie and everyone will learn something. It's poignant, touching, dramatic and humorous. It has all the ear marks of an award winner that you will want to see again and again. One you hate to see end and wish it had another sequel and a prequel. It is one of the most outstanding movies of it's time to shed some truth on the much ridiculed Native Americans. It shows how intuitive they are and with tons of ingenuity with a love and respect of this beautiful country we call America. I hope one day you all get to see it.",
