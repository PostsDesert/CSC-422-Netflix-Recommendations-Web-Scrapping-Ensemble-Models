But the English dub did pick good voice actors and what captured me on the dubbed version was Marc Diraison voice performance as Guts.\n\nThis is a great anime of the one of the longest and still good manga out there written and drawn by the great Kentaro Miura! The anime did his manga a decent amount of justice at least.",
