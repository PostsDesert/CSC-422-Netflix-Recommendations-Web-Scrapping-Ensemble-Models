        "reviewBody": "...or rather nightmarish,this is probably De Palma\"s finest achievement.Here his obsession with Alfred Hitchcock is subdued or thoroughly mastered.Of course we cannot help but thinking of \"Vertigo\" but De Palma's work is made with taste :two good leads -Cliff Robertson,whose eyes seem to reflect fatality,and Genevieve Bujold whose beauty seems to plunge the audience into a dream(the sequence in the church makes her look like a madonna)-.Besides,Bernard Herrman's score is absolutely mind-boggling,enhancing the strangest sequences in an almost religious incantation.The cinematography is up to scratch,and the directing remains sober.The Hitchcock quotations take a back seat to De Palma's talent:compare this work with the grand guignol of \"Carrie\" the follow-up,the sensationalism tinged with melodrama of \"fury\" (no,it's not a remake of the Fritz Lang classic),the plagiarism of \"dressed to kill\" or \"Body double\".\n\nOne may regret the last pictures in slow motion.But that's minor quibble.This is De Palma's magnum opus,and it will be \"blow out\" before he puts out a genuinely personal movie.Do not miss it."
