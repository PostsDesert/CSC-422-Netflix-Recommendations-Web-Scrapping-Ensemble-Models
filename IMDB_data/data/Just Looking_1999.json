When his mom and stepdad send him to stay with relatives for the summer, he becomes determined to catch someone \"in the act.\"\n\nThe story itself is interesting; watching the lengths to which young \"Lenny\" (Merriman) goes to fulfill his curiosity is quite funny in and of itself. But there's also a dramatic aspect, a life lesson if you will. Through his exploits, Lenny learns about life and the responsibilities therein. Overall, not a bad effort and quite an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours."
