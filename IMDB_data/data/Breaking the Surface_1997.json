        "reviewBody": "\"Breaking the Surface: The Greg Louganis Story\" contains much information on this famous American Olympic diving champion. It covers not only his professional career but also his formative years as a youngster. His home background includes his relationship with his foster parents, and presents incidents which helped shape the athlete's adult attitudes and behaviors. Alan Hines' script tends to be uncommonly sad and sentimental; indeed, to go by Hines, this champ certainly did not have much fun either as a child or adolescent. In fact, his adult life was also depicted as being loaded with dismal challenges. It's all a rather gloomy picture painted of this celebrity, who appears to be a very nice guy having one sad thing after another happen to him. Still, the TV script claims to be based on a book coauthored by Louganis himself, so one hopes that this presentation is reasonably authentic. Mario Lopez acquits himself well as a sensitive, grown up Louganis.",
