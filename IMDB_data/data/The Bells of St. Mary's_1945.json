        "reviewBody": "This was a just a plain, nice story, one of those kind I tend favor simply they don't have any \"bad guys\" in them and still keep the story interesting.\n\nI expected Ingrid Bergman's character, \"Sister Mary,\" from what the liners notes on the video box said, to be a sort-of villain portraying a hard-line rigid nun but that wasn't the case at all. In fact, in her several philosophical disputes the priest \"Father Chuck O'Malley\" (Bing Crosby) I sided with her because Crosby was a little too liberal regarding punishment. (He never wanted to scold or punish any misbehaving kid., for example. No discipline is not a good idea, as parents know.)\n\nThe story is a little unrealistic in that a strong-willed business tycoon would not abandon all his business plans and hand over a brand-new million-dollar (today it would be many millions) building to a church. However, it's nice to see! These kind of old-fashioned films are almost collector's items today but they are pleasant to watch and pretty good entertainment.",
