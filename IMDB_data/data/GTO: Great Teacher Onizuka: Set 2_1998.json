        "reviewBody": "GTO seems like another semi-hentai ecchi series for 14 year olds at first glance but it definitely is not. While this is definitely a man's show (women tend to not get it) it isn't dumb or overly crude. Onizuka is a great teacher. Beginning as just a pervert he evolves quite quickly into a radical who believes that the students shouldn't undergo the boredom and humiliation he did. While full of weird, sex driven scenarios, GTO doesn't turn into a porno and uses them for laughs rather than sick titilation. I can't express enough how much fun this series is. It's currently my favorite anime and I recommend it to all anime fans and especially the non-fans who think anime is just giant robots and fighting. (Did I mention there's a bit of fighting here too? But I digress.) 10/10"
