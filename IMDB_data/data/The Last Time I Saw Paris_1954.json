But the real star is Van Johnson. Great acting. The emotion that he shows is outstanding and very real. I am an older man now...57 years old. I had to reach for my hanky several times. The love...the joy...the tears... and the sorrow of a man for his wife and his child. Well...well...it is too bad they don't have movies like this anymore. I miss them. This is one I will save and enjoy seeing again someday....",
