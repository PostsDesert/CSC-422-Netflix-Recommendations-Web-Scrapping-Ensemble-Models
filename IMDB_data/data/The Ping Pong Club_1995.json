But sometimes one bulb burns brighter than the rest and you kind of feel like bragging.\n\nPing Pong Club is about the stupid escapades of a gang of boys and one girl, who are supposedly training to play Ping Pong competitively, yet less than 1% of the show is devoted to Ping Pong. The rest is dirty, crazy nonsense, that's brilliant and juvenile at the same time.\n\nPeople usually compare this to South Park, perhaps in an effort to market something unknown to Western audiences, but a much closer comparison would be Cromartie High School, which is another brilliant show that you should watch. The very fact that you've stumbled upon this page, and not something more mainstream, means that you're probably rummaging for gems. Well, you may have just found one.",
