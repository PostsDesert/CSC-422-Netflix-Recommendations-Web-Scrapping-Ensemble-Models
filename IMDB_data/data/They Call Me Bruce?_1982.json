Johnny Yune is great in this one (I wish he would have made more movies). His one liners are so cheesy that you can't help but laugh, and his facial expressions when he is swinging those nunchucks makes me hit the rewind button every time...... Anyone who does not find this movie funny does not have a sense of humor!!!"
