        "reviewBody": "Dead Or Alive 2 isn't the regular sequel one might expect it to be. Remember, we're dealing with Miike here-and-frankly, this is so weird that it's hard to really claim it to be a sequel at all. The two main characters from the first piece are being kept here and they both make a great performance here.\n\nThe story itself is being brought to life by two contract killers who happen to stumble on each other, who turn out to be friends from childhood. Miike ventures into a quite different visual plot, following both the actual Yakuza violence taking place in Tokyo whilst the story's two protagonists are residing on an island in the countryside where they were brought up. I guess I have to see it one more time to really make up my mind about things, but the first impression was neat, as always with Miike. The landscapes and views being exposed in this film is simply amazing and while the thrills of violence aren't numbering as much as in its prequel, there's a good weight put here to comedy and humor instead. Thumbs up. Can't wait to see the final in the trilogy.",
