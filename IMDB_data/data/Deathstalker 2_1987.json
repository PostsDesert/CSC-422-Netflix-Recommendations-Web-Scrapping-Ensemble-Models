        "reviewBody": "I quite enjoyed the first Deathstalker film, a knowingly silly barbarian romp. This sequel is from writer/director Jim Wynorski and is pretty typical of his output: cheap, poorly acted, but with lots of T&A and a spot of softcore sex.\n\nThis time around, warrior Deathstalker is played by John Terlesky, whose s**t-eating grin, wisecracks and big chin (Bruce Campbell has some serious competition from this guy) really got on my nerves. He's not exactly Arnold Schwarzenegger either, making for a rather lacklustre hero. Thankfully, the heroine of the piece, Princess Evie, is played by stunning softcore actress Monique Gabrielle who gladly shows off her assets and very nice they are too. Also displaying great form are Toni Naples as wicked sorceror Jarek's evil sidekick Sultana, and Maria Socas as an Amazon Queen.\n\nHot women in various states of undress aside, the film is pretty dire: there are numerous poorly choreographed battles, a really dumb wrestling scene between Deathstalker and an Amazonian warrior woman (played by wrestler Queen Kong), some bargain basement zombies, a few scenes borrowed from the first film to keep down costs, and lots of terrible dialogue delivered unconvincingly by the 'stars'.\n\n3.5 out of 10, rounded up to 4 for the dwarf playing a lute.",
