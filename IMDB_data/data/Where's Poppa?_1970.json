Remember back during the Watergate hearings and witnesses with talk about limited or full hangouts? Well, this is a full hangout. No one goes away without being insulted. And all of this is done without someone vomiting, breaking wind at the dinner table, or scratching their crotch....the sine qua non's of modern 'comedy.' \n\nThere is something in the opening scene of Touch of Evil, the long setup toward scaring Mom to death with the gorilla suit, only to find she is immune to such tactics and simply wants her Fruit Loops in Pepsi. \n\nWe have the cabbie fly by an elderly black woman to pick up the naked Ron Liebman and the wonderful reference to the Cornel Wilde 'epic' by the boyz in the park. All is complete when the Mother from Hell makes sure Trish V sees her son's lovely tush at dinner. \n\nHousemate ended by remarking 'now this is a funny movie.'",
