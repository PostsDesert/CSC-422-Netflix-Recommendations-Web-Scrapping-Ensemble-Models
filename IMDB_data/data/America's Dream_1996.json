        "reviewBody": "I liked mostly the \"Long Black Song\"; whether black or white a woman is a woman, and a man is a man. I think the film should have had a more feminist shade. Still, Tina Lifford's performance is really good and natural, though the sex bit seems badly done with bad cuts. The \"Boy who painted Christ black\" seemed one of those still stuck between \"good\" and \"evil\". The narrative seemed limited and shallow. \"The Reunion\" seemed to tell the story, rather then ask questions - so to speak. I think it could have been better in terms of the screeplay, casting and acting."
