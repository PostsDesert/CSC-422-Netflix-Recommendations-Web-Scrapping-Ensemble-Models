The plot,acting, and direction is mediocre (and thats being kind). However with Cynthia Rothrock, Richard Norton (who should be as big, if not bigger than J.C.Van Damme), and Keith Cooke (whose kicks rival Bruce Lees), there are some excellent martial art fight scenes staged. Whilst this can't save the film from being anything more than average, a decent budget and director would benfit the stars on show (who are no less talented in the acting stakes than the likes of Schwarzenegger, Norris, or Van Damme). In particular Richard Norton, whose presence and martial arts skills make exciting viewing."
