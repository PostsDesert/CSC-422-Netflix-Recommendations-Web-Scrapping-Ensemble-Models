It turned out to be interesting thanks in part to the stylish film-making and the nice job it did in keeping the audience's attention. \n\nIt got a few extra points for at least us males gaping at Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, who looked spectacular, but lost a few for some big credibility holes in the story. \n\nThe film also would have been much better with a different male lead than Antonio Bandaras, someone who could speak English so people could understand him!\n\nWith Brian De Palma directing, you get some stylish camera shots in here, so it's a good visual movie....a lot more than just girl-watching. It's a film you could enjoy multiple times, especially if you get a translator for Bandaras.",
