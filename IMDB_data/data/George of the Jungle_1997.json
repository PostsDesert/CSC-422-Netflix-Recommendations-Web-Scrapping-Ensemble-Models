We also see an elephant act like a dog and along the way our hero (Brendan Fraser) is a likable boob. Sometimes it's just plain stupid but that's what you get with any comedy. \n\nDisney has this in the \"PG\" mode so we get some of the standard peeing, farting, sex jokes and innuendos, kicking people in the groin....you know, all those supposedly-hilarious gags that have become so commonplace in modern family comedies. There is enough original material in here, though, to enjoy this a couple of times.",
