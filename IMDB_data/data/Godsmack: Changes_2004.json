        "reviewBody": "This is the best Music/Documentary DVD I have ever seen (and I've seen a few). The behind the scenes stuff was great, and it was done by the same guy who directed The Boys In Brazil DVD \"RUSH in Rio\" Andrew MacNaughtan. You can watch this new 2004 Godsmack CHANGES DVD either with interviews intermixed with songs, or just the songs straight through. There is also an extensive photo gallery. Filmed in Pennsylvania, the Battle Of The Drums is the best, where Shannon and Sully face off with full drumsets rotating and dualing on two circular drum risers. I saw these boys from Haverhill, Massachusetts (where I used to live) both nights in March 2004 at the Forum in Los Angeles; \"The Godsmack FACELESS tour\" and the drum solos seem even better on the DVD, if you can believe that! This DVD has a lot more than drums, like hot chicks, inside lingo, farting drum tracks, pleasure positions on the daily sheets, meditating, and more. Listen, if you feel like getting smacked, you like pioneers on the cutting edge of Hard Rock, or like seeing and hearing two of the most powerful drummers in rock battle it out in Pennsylvania, this DVD will be the best $17.99 you ever spent."
