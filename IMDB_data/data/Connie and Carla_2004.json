Yes, there are drag queens and when we saw it a few people walked out. But most of the crowd - a few kids, college students, and mostly older retired people - loved it! There are many funny scenes, and the movie itself could be called a musical, as there are plenty of renditions of broadway songs with the ladies dressed in drag. It is a cute story, the drag queens are very likeable and the movie makes some attempt to understand why they dress in drag, and to be understanding about the rest of the world's perception of them. Not everyone is ready to see a movie starring some drag queens, but for those that can look past that, it's a heartwarming story about friendship and acceptance :o)",
