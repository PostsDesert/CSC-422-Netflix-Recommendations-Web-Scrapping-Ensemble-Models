        "reviewBody": "This film was truly terrible. Besides the special effects being far, far, far below par, the story itself was very poorly done. The main character seemed oblivious to logic and common sense thru-out the entire film. The viewer is not allowed to discover or learn anything for himself, instead everything is spoon-fed to him. The characters themselves were shallow and one dimensional. Things that should have been explained are left in the air and things that were easily decipherable were explained to the most minute detail. And the story concept in itself, while good on paper just doesn't play well in live action. \n\nWhen all is said and done, I think you would have more fun smacking your hand with a hammer.",
