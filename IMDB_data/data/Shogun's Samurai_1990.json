        "reviewBody": "I won't waste your time on repeating what the others have said, but I will repeat that this is the best of the best when it comes to modern mini-series. What I would like to see instead of all the stupid reality shows that plague T.V., is a series based on the James Clavell books starting with Shogun A.D.1600, then Tai-Pan A.D. 1841, then move to King Rat A.D. 1945, Noble House A.D. 1963, and finish with Whirlwind A.D.1979. The dates are from WhirlWind, the fifth novel in the Asian Saga. Since this will probably never happen, pick-up Shogun, Tai-Pan, and King Rat as they are all available in either DVD or VHS. Richard Chamberlain and Yoko Shimada are truly terrific together. They play their parts so well, that you can't help but to be drawn into their lives. Having lived in Japan for three years, Shogun had special meaning to me, but anyone who loves action and a good romance will not be disappointed. Please check it out. No flaws in this one.",
