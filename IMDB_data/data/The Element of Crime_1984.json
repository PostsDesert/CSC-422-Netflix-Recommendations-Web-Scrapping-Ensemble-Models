        "reviewBody": "How to describe a film so avant-garde that Dirk Bogarde threatened to quit the Cannes jury if it got an award? A film that references Blade runner, with a burned-out cop (Michael Elphick) brought back into a futuristic Europe to find a serial killer. A film that has been described by some as \"The Silence of the Lambs\" meets \"Delicatessen\".\n\nFans of David Lynch may thrill at this futuristic film noir. Many will run for the exits, as it takes quite a bit of time to develop.\n\nIt is Lars von Trier's first English-language film, and it is in a sepia-tone that adds to the feeling that Europe is crumbling. Water is an element that flows throughout, again adding to the feeling that something is rotten.\n\nElphick hooks up with Me Me Lai in her last film. She had done a lot of cannibal work before this - an interesting combination of actors.\n\nElphick goes into a experimental drug-induced hypnotic state to try and recreate the crimes and catch the killer. Things get really surreal from here.\n\nCinematography, sound, and special effects were all superb in this very strange film.",
