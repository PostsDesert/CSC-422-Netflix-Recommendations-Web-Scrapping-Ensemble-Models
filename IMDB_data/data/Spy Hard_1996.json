It's actually a pretty funny movie that I enjoyed watching and will maybe enjoy again. \n\nCharles Durning and Barry Bostwick are funny together. Marcia Gay Harden is funny too. And of course, Leslie Nielsen, he's funny in this film but not funnier than some of his other films. \n\nIf you like this kind of comedy, and Leslie Nielsen then you'd like this. But if you're looking for a funnier film with Nielsen, than rent another one like dracula or any of the naked gun movies, airplane is always good too."
