It isn't that I couldn't understand it. It just had such awful lines like, \"I'm sending you home guilty as charged\" or \"Not Nice, pay the price.\" The crew filmed this movie in Digital Video to save on the budget but that doesn't ever take away from the movie. A worthy rental or addition to your library.",
