        "reviewBody": "A Disappointing documentary about the human body that actually shows very little of the internal workings of the human body. Instead it has a lot of interviews with people talking about their bodies: A woman trying to get pregnant, a man getting treated for a brain tumor, a basketball player exercising, a taxi driver. We are treated to some microscopic views of an ovum being fertilized, and some brain CT scan images, and there are a few scientists discussing DNA and stem cells, but that is about all. The program revels in the wonder and mystery of the body instead of providing information on how it actually works. Not for anyone seeking to learn about anatomy.",
