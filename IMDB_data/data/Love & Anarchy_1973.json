Love (2015) is such a unique movie like i've never seen before, the actor who plays Murphy is great but my only problem was with the actor who plays Electra, I don't know if it's because of his accent but I don't felt too much with her, the actor who plays Omi was good but I wished it was more of her.\n\nThe story is interesting but I would've loved that it were more complex, this could've been easily a two part movie like Nymphomaniac. Anyway, another great film by Gaspar Noé.",
