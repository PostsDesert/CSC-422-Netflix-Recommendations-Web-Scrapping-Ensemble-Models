        "reviewBody": "Foxy Brown is one of Pam Grier's best blaxploitation movies (topped only by Coffy). From the James Bondish opening sequence of Pam dancing to the \"Foxy Brown\" theme song, to Antonio Fargas (\"That's my sister...and she's a whole lotta woman!\") to the spectacular ending which I will not spoil, this is a must see for any a) Pam Grier fan b)blaxploitation fan c)anybody who wants to see a strong female character beat the crap out of her opponents. That being said, it does feature the standard \"Grier sleeps her way to the top of crime syndicate\", a plot ripped off of Coffy. With scenes like the famous \"Afro as holster\" sequence and the inclusion of a Black Panther-esque anti-drug group this movie is fun from start to finish. Don't believe that Maltin; Mr. Charlie gave LaserBlast a better rating; he gave Sheba Baby, which is awful, a better rating. See Foxy Brown tonite!",
