The majority of the film critics felt that Burns did not make a new movie with \"She's the One\" but merely an extension of \"The Brothers McMullen\", on the contrary. \"She's the One\" is a witty, interesting comedy about the problems that men face with the women in their lives. The more you watch this movie the more you will appreciate it. Edward Burns really stands out as an extraordinary actor."
