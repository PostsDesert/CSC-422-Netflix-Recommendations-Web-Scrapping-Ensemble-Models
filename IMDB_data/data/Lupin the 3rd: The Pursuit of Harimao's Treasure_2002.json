Not only is he in Europe but is also hunting down these 3 statues to unlock the ancient \"Harimao's Treasure\". \n\nNot only is there Booby traps, puzzles, and a young female archaeologist. There's a band of Nazis trying to get the treasure for themselves. And their leader is very freaky looking.\n\nI won't give out what Harimao's Treasure is, so you gotta see it for yourself. This is another fine Lupin anime to watch. And has plenty of funny parts in it too.\n\nI give it 8/10",
