The movie starts off very slow with no point. Abruptly in the middle we switch to a blood and gore horror flick with no point. The action is too close together and too much violence that need not be there. And the end, when she holds up the blood spattered disc. That is SOOOO tacky. Like who wouldn't wash the blood off? Well, they did make a monster. A monstrosity of a movie. But you'll learn, intern. You'll learn."
