        "reviewBody": "I'm biased: I love horses; I love movies with and about horses. I've seen horse-related movies good, bad, & indifferent. But there was nothing bad or indifferent about In Pursuit of Honor. The first time I watched it, I cried like a baby and swore I'd never watch it again, it devastated me so. But it draws me back again and again, and I've watched the movie probably a dozen times. To my mind, In Pursuit of Honor is one of that rare breed: the perfect movie. The writing, filming, and acting all combine to create the kind of movie that, like a good book, you want to experience over and over again. And if nothing else, it showed me that Don Johnson is not the shallow, pretty face I'd always considered him; he gives a wonderfully restrained performance, as does Craig Sheffer. An entertaining, educational, historically accurate movie that my husband and I will enjoy at least another dozen times."
