        "reviewBody": "\"Garfield and Friends\" is a great show, based on a great comic strip. I just loved how funny, creative and original it was. If I had a disappointment though, and this has been mentioned by many other reviewers, I didn't think the \"US Acres\" (or \"Orson's Farm\") segments were as witty or as fun. But there were some fun characters, Wade the Duck was my favourite, and there have been some good moments. But everything else is first rate. The cartoon animation is wonderful, really nice to look at and very colourful. The theme tune is wonderful, and hummable even after a long time. And I love the characters, the lazy Garfield, adorable mischievous Oadie, narcissistic Nermal and goofy Binky The Clown. And the voice work was superb, Lorenzo Music(R.I.P) owned the character of Garfield and part of the reason why I love the show so much. The scripts are dry and witty, full of hilarious asides uttered by Garfield mostly, and the story lines are a lot of fun. In conclusion, this is a great cartoon classic, with something for everyone! 9/10 Bethany Cox",
