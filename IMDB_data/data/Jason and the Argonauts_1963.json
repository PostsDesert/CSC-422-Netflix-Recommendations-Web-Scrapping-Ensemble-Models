        "reviewBody": "It's really rather hard to believe that this picture received mediocre reviews when it first came out.It appears that most now regard it as a classic,and in certain circles,it has achieved cult status.True,Armstrong's Jason is a rather bland character,and could use some foibles and quirks to become more realistic and human,but this could be lodged against the writers.Kovacks as Medea certainly does look marvelous,but shows none of the inner torment of the character of classic mythology.(On the other hand,this movie was made for kids,and we don't need to introduce them to Eurypides' virago just yet.)An outstanding cast of well-trained British actors provides sterling support.Naismith personifies loyalty and good-natured common sense;Troughton is remarkable as a tortured sinner who is brave and hasn't lost his sense of humor;Green is probably the most realistic Hercules ever developed;And Gwilliam is the personification of outraged hospitality and necromantic malevolence.Wilmer has a good time doing a Rathbonesque villain.The special effects are first rate,given the state of the art at the time,and Blackman and MacGinnis develop wonderful portraits of the deities.They have a genuine relationship,and appear to be a man and wife.The plot has more depth than most films of this genre,and is lots of fun,besides."
