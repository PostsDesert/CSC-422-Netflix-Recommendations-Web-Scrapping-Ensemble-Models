        "reviewBody": "With a cast featuring Landon and Gabriella Hall, Jennifer Burton, and a couple of cute unknowns in Mellara Gold and Elisa Madison you'd expect spectacular results. Instead we get a unspirited groan-fest that is filled with terrible acting, no fire, and poor \"philosophical discussions\". Even the story of an actress and her \"understudy\" (shades of Showgirls) being watched by a stalker is poorly developed.\n\nAlthough the gorgeous and talented Jennifer Burton is in the film, her role is tiny; a throw in. We do get to see the drop-dead gorgeous Landon Hall, but her acting is atrocious. Remember the episode of Seinfeld where Kramer was dating a woman who spoke with an unaudible mumbled voice that got Jerry to unwillingly wear a pirate shirt on a T.V. interview? Landon's performance is just like that, with 60-70% of her lines being difficult to decipher. She's so damn gorgeous, but she's a brutal actress. Mellara Gold plays the understudy and she's O.K. but she's just a Kansas stereotype who has this thing for carnation pink lipstick. Marc Greenberg usually delivers great adult entertainment, but this one is pretty blah."
