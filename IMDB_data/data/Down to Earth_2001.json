        "reviewBody": "To enjoy any fantasy comedy, the viewer must be able to suspend disbelief. It is impossible to suspend disbelief for Down to Earth.\n\nWhy do we see Chris Rock as Chris Rock, when everyone around him sees him as Charles Wellington, rich, fat white man? Why? Because the producers thought they could make more money showcasing Rock, than having us see Rock as Wellington. It ruins much of the movie's attempted humor. For example, when Rock (as Wellington) uses the \"N\" word, black folks who hear him become furious, and we have to remember that he is supposedly this rich, fat white man.\n\nThe film does have some funny moments, and Regina King is attractive as the love interest. It could have been really good, though.",
