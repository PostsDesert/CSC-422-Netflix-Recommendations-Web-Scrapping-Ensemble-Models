        "name": "Broly's Worst Movie",
        "reviewBody": "Yes, worse than Bio-Broly. Let me explain.\n\nThis movie focuses on Goten, Trunks and Videl. Certainly, an odd combo to pick for the movie but sure, let's go with it. Broly somehow survived the encounter in the last movie and crashes to Earth. I guess if he was able to survive Planet Vegeta blowing up as a baby, getting exploded by a Goku punch and being on the planet as it gets destroyed is just a minor inconvenience. Broly is then frozen in a lake until hearing Goten cry like a baby wakes him up. From there he goes on a bezerker rage only yelling \"Kakarot\".\n\nThis movie also takes quite a bit of time just to get started. Trunks and Goten agree to help out this town that is being tormented by a monster. Is the monster Broly? No, we haven't gotten to him yet. They agree to help out the town becuase Ttunks really likes the necklace that the priest is wearing. At first I thought it was because the necklace looked just like a Dragon Ball, but apparently that never crossed anyone's mind. Goten, Trunks and Videl are gathering all the Dragon Balls to make a wish. What were they planning on wishing for? I don't know, maybe Goten finally wanted to meet his dead-beat ghost dad.\n\nAlong with, how did Broly survive? And, why do they need the Dragon Balls? This movie raises other questions. Most of them wander into spoiler territory so I won't go over them here. But suffice it to say, the lore of the Dragon, how wishes are made, who is dead, and why Krillin is dressed like Piccolo are all put into question.\n\nThis movie has problems, it is poorly paced, poor action scenes, power scaling and lore that makes no sense. But I am one of the few that actually does like Goten and Trunks as characters, and some of the back and forth they have during the fight is good. Also, more than any other Dragon Ball movie, the team feels completely out of their depth and out classed. This does lead to a good sense of fear for the audience. The conclusion makes little sense, but it does give some simple satisfaction.",
