        "reviewBody": "Much of this is seeing some very cool looking villages in mountainous regions as the Northern Alps dominate. That's fine; it was beautiful, from the tiny villages in the small valleys to the port cities, it all looks spectacular.\n\nAfter all these years of mainly seeing still pictures of it, it was nice to see 360-aerial shots of the famous Leaning Tower of Pisa, as well as a bunch of other historic sights. There is no place like Italy, in my humble opinion (and I'm not Italian!). The only thing missing are shots of Milan. Why that city wasn't include in the Visions Of Italy DVD package, I don' know.\n\nHigh-definition DVDs like the one I saw here on \"Visions Of Italy,\" make the country look all the better, too - just incredible in parts. The steady cameras on these low-flying helicopters give you pictures you cannot believe, almost better than actually being there, I was told by someone who had been there. Here, at least you don't have to fight the crowd of tourists.",
