        "reviewBody": "This film reminded me of the Iranian film \"White Balloon\", in the following sense.\n\nIn White Balloon, the whole plot is \"two kids go to buy a goldfish, and a bunch of stuff happens to them along the way\". That's it. Nothing else. There isn't necessarily any point to any of the stuff that happens to them. There isn't any theme. There's just... lots and lots of stuff. And then the movie just ends.\n\nIn the same way, this movie is: a kid escapes from juvenile detention, and a bunch of stuff happens to him while he's on the run. And then the movie is over. What's the point? No point.\n\nIf you can get PAST that, then there's a lot to enjoy here. This, in spite of the fact, that as another commenter pointed out, there are lots of technical flaws in the cinematography, that might *appear* to be intentional, \"for effect\", but are probably just goof ups or inexperience. However, in between the out of focus shots and the \"unsteady-cam\" shots and the underexposed shots are some really interesting sequences and very nice use of music to create mood.\n\nTo really enjoy this film, change your expectations: see it as a series of 3-5 minute \"mini-plays\" that all happen to revolve around the same character, Ryan Kazinski. And then, just to watch this young actor, Ryan Daugherty in his first feature film, is a real treat. Especially heartbreaking is the scene between Ryan and his brother (played by his real life brother, Jon Daugherty.) I expect that after some casting directors see this film, the phone may be ringing in the Daugherty household.",
