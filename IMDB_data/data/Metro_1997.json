Roper meanwhile is trying to juggle his job, his girlfriend and train a sniper to become a negotiator like him.\n\nThis film was made before Nutty Porfessor but was held back because the makers realesed it was a bit of a dog by itself and decided to wait till Nutty Professor had made Murphy hot again before riding on that wave. Sadly I was one of those fooled into thinking that the hot new Murphy had made a cool cop thriller. Rather this is a by the numbers affair that has plenty of cliches and very little spark to it.\n\nWhat spark there is, is added by Murphy's motor mouth performance  he is funny and lively even when the film isn't. Rapaport is also good despite everything else and British born Ejogo is good as Murphy's girlfriend. Wincott's villain is right out of a catalogue and is typical of the film's lack of initiative or spark.\n\nOverall, like most average cop thrillers it's worth a watch once because it is just about entertaining. The problem is it is plain  average. It never rises above the norm and there are much better cop thrillers out there than this. The producers and studio knew it  who am I to argue."
