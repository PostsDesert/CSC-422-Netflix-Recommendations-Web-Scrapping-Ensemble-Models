        "reviewBody": "This movie is fantastic!! with the way horror movies have been lately this sure was a nice shock to my system, it seems low budget movies are the way to go if your looking for a good scare! Well this movie has it all guys! Sure the plot is basic \" Crazy kid escapes mental hospital, kills a tonne of people in gross, sick and in my opinion very creative ways \" but thats what makes this movie work, its simple, the photography is A+, gore FX are great, SPX are nicely done and with a few jumpy moments thrown in, its the perfect recipe for horror if you ask me. Oh yeah not to mention the naked girls! Its set for release in the USA early next year, but i was lucky enough to get a screener, as i run a horror movie website. Be sure to check this out because with all i mentioned above combined with a SUPERB performance by Robert Z'Dar ( Maniac cop & Tango & Cash )you have a sick and very twisted horror movie on your hands!",
