I think so very important film but it's definitely not a film that children should watch by themselves because the brutality is really harsh for kids under 10. It's a strong PG-13 film, definitely not appropriate for anybody under 10 or 11 because of the deeply disturbing nature Of racial harassment this little girl receives.\n\nIt is very important that it's shown in film because film should not be sugarcoated but it did have a very damaging effect on some people who watch the film at a very young age so it's definitely a very big family viewing film for younger audiences. It's probably more appropriate for high school age",
