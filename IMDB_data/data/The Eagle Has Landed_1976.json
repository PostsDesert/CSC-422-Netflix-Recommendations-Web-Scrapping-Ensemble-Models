        "reviewBody": "\"The Eagle has Landed\" is a fine World War II fiction film placed in England that deals with a German commando operation planned to kidnap (or kill) Winston Chruchill.\n\nThe p√¨cture is most entertaining right from the start -when the plan is designed- and keeps up all along when it comes to the operation's achieving. A good script, excellent British outdoor locations, well made action sequences and a most competent cast are highlights of the film. Its also interesting that the German commandos are shown as decent and even likable men, professional soldiers that just like the allies fight a war for their country even if they don't agree with the Nazi regime that rules it.\n\n\"The Eagle has Landed\" is also a good farewell from movies for director John Sturges (this is his last work in direction) a prolific man that gave us movie and western fans very good titles of the genre such us \"Gunfight at OK Corral\", \"The Magnificent Seven\", \"Last Train from Gun Hill\" and the more contemporary \"Bad Day at Black Rock\".\n\nA most entertaining and enjoyable film in the genre.",
