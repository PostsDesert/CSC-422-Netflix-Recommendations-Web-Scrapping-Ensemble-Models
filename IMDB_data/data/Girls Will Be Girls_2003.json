        "reviewBody": "A comedy/drama with guys in drag playing the three female leads. Over the hill actress Evie Harris (Jack Plotnick) and her maid Coco (Clinton Leupp) bring in a housemate--young energetic Varla (Jeffrey Roberson). However it turns out Varla is the daughter of Evie's long-decreased rival. Coco tries to keep everything under control but it doesn't work.\n\nThe film is very funny--full of vicious bitchy humor which mostly works. Plotnick spits out toxic lines with ease, Leupp plays straight man most of the time and Roberson is full of life and energy. It moves quickly (it's only 80 minutes) has some incredible costumes and production design (Evie's house alone is a jaw-dropper) and has some nice eye candy from hunky Ron Mathews (playing Stevie--Evie's son). However some of the jokes fall flat (or are TOO vicious) and it takes an unwise turn to all out drama towards the end...but the VERY end is a happy one. A one of a kind and not really great but is worth catching.",
