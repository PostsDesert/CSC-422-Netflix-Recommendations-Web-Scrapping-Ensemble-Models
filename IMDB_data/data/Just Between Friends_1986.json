        "reviewBody": "This movie has the unlikely premise of two woman becoming friends all the while unaware that they're in love with the same man. Mary Tyler Moore is Holly, the wife. Christine Lahti is Sandy the girlfriend. Ted Danson (ugly as ever) is Chip. This movie wants you to believe that a woman who is career driven, has a foul mouth, lives on junk food, chain smokes, wears funky (a.k.a. ugly) clothes & has big hair she's automatically \"interesting\" (Sandy). If she's married & loves her husband, lives a healthy lifestyle, has two teenage kids & a beautiful home, doesn't work outside that home, & is a kind person she's \"boring\" (Holly). The message is pretty twisted. This movie is loaded with clichés, is unrealistic & has a TV movie feel to it even though it was released in theaters. Despite it's flaws, the soap opera plot does keep you interested, but the storyline drags on at times.",
