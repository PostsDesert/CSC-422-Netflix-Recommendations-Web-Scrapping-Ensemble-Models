You know this may be kind of weird but if you ask me this movie is a pretty bad influence to kids, Why? Because it's not right for a fourth grader to be able to get a bunch of equitment to do illegal things, Why? Because in this case a company didn't come barging in they got permission from a person that can make laws and there's no right for a kid to break the law by sneaking around big buissness and stuff just because a couple of kids thinks it's unfair when the parents, the mayor, and the govener all agreed that this could happen. I mean what is this going to teach our children: To be spoiled brats and beg and yell and scream when something happens that they don't like? It sounds pretty dumb, but you have to admit I do have a point and plus one of the major reasons is that it's a kid movie. Well what does that have to do with anything? Alot, because you know that it's just going to be a happy ending and the kid or kids are going to win or get something they wanted or whatever and you know something life ain't that simple, but Nickeloden seems to think it is and seems to think that they can show kids that they can get whatever they want and it really doesn't work like that. (At least in my opinion)."
