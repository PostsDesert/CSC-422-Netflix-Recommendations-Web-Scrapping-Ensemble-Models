        "reviewBody": "Witness\" works on 3 levels – as a thriller , drama and romance. The thriller elements of the movie appear at the beginning and the ending of the movie, while the middle of the film is basically a drama with a love story in it. It's an interesting combination and while it might not work for those who like pure thrillers or dramas it certainly worked for me. One has to remember that \"Witness\" is first a electrifying and poignant love story , then the thriller. A romantic thriller.\n\nIt's a movie worth watching just for the fact that is first and one of the few films to focus on Amish culture. As a kid I would laugh at their philosophy of life . The more and more I'm getting older the more I'm thinking they are right. The Amish way of life has many virtues - they have a deep faith in God , pacifism , sense of community.\n\n\"Witness\" is a story about cultural clash between two completely different worlds. Both cultures are forced to come together. Each one had to search out the moralities, prejudices and actions of the other. The film is thankfully devoid of easy moralizing.\n\nIt's an interesting thing that Sylvester Stallone (\"Rocky\") and Jack Nicholson (\"One flew over the cuckoo nest\") were considered for the role of John Book . While I do believe that they would handle the role very well , I'm happy that Harrison Ford (\"Raiders of the lost ark\") got the part in the end. Harrison Ford gives his finest performance in \"Witness\" , the only one which got him an Oscar nomination. Hord walks away from his hero persona (Indiana Jones , Han Solo). His John Book isn't stereotypical cynical and strong cop. His tough enough to be convincing as a city cop , but it's more about his sense of duty and dignity. It's interesting how the film uses Ford's real-life carpenter's talent. Kelly McGillis (\"Top gun\") also gives a great and underrated performance , the best in her career. Her Rachel is very sensible and lonely woman , who finds soul mate in Book. Both Ford and McGillis have a wonderful chemistry together . The say much more by the things they don't say (for example the bating scene , the dance scene). The romantic plot reaches it's climax with one of the best on-screen kisses in the history of film. This brief-scene is powerful , sincere and moving. The love story here is beautiful and tragic. \n\nDanny Glover(\"Lethal weapon\") does a nice job as the bad guy. Who could forget Lukas Haas (\"Inception\") as the Amish kid. His cheerful , colorful face is something that can't go unseen. Watch out for Viggo Mortensen (\"The Lord of the rings \" trilogy) in his debut as an Amish. \n\nPeter Weir gives a brilliant direction . This is a simple story wit heart . Every dramatic moment is powerful and every small scene is important. Weir isn't a action/thriller director , yet he gives us great Hitchcockian set pieces such as the scene in the toilet and the final confrontation in style of \"High noon\" (silo death). \n\nThe screenplay quite rightfully won the Oscar. The film's script by Earl W. Wallace, William Kelley and Pamela Wallace has become a frequent model for budding screenwriters, often used to display clear structure in a screenplay. It is a film about adults, whose lives have dignity and whose choices matter to them just like it's a story about cops.\n\nThe soundtrack by Maurice Jarre is good , but I think it would have sounded much better with real orchestra instead of synthesizer. John Searle's cinematography is gorgeous – the scene of raising the barn is cinematic lyricism.\n\nHighly recommended. I give it 8/10.",
