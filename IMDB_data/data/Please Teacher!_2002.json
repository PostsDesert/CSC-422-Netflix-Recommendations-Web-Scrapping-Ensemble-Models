This anime has love, sorrow, science fiction, fantasy, humor and all the body that makes a good anime. The characters are introduced in interesting ways and each is unique and different. Each character has a role in the story and none of them are plain or ordinary. The characters also grow within and along with the plot of the story which makes this anime one worth watching! I know I'm glad I bought it!"
