Throw in two very attractive, and talented acting-capable, girls...two guys and a jock...and an Asian pothead quick with one liners...\n\nand you got a pretty solid movie. \n\nWhile the Perfect Score won't give you everything you want, I feel that it will make you just happy enough that you caught the showing.\n\nSo if you're looking for a movie to sit back and relax too...and perhaps vicariously wonder if you could steal the answers to the SAT...check out the movie.\n\nI enjoyed it, and chances are if you kept on reading this post.\n\nYou will too.",
