It came on when ReBoot ended. Everyone thought of it as a replacement for ReBoot, and did not want to see it. Even I didn't want to see it because I thought of it as a replacement as well, but I still watched it anyways and I loved it. Shadow Raiders/War Planets is much better than what most people think of it. It has awesome graphics, awesome characters, and awesome plotlines! I really hope that Mainframe will create a season three. For all you ReBoot fans who have refused to watch it or have not watched it much, WATCH IT OR WATCH IT MORE!! It is a really excellent show that you will probably love once you really get into it."
