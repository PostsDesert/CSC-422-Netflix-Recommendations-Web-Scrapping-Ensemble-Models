But even if this movie wasn't based on a real singing superstar, it would have been great to watch anyway.\n\nJennifer Lopez is stunning in every way as Selena. She hits all the right chords as a teenager, a woman in love, a dutiful daughter and sister, and a singer adored by legions of fans. And she loved everyone of them right back. The actors playing her family are all great, too (especially her father). Ms. Lopez also has a sweet, natural chemistry with Jon Seda as Chris. Their relationship is so real because they were friends first...friends who fell in love.\n\nMs. Lopez also does a great job lip-synching Selena's songs, and the ending will bring tears to your eyes. A must see!"
