        "reviewBody": "This is a little known war time epic movie that should rank with the likes of \"Patton\". The story is about the grudge match that's spawned from sinking of battleship Hood by the German battleship Bismark. A full blown search for the German battleship by the British navy takes place to hunt down and sink the Bismark. Acting is first class, and although the special effects have something to be desired by today's standard, movie none the less conveys the tension and excitement of what probably was the greatest and the final naval conflict between battleships. In recent years Bob Ballard and the Oceanographic Institute rediscovered the sunken remains of the battleship Bismark which confirmed the ferocity of the fire power that was exchanged in this naval warfare. This movie gets mentioned by movie producers of today when they sight their seminal influence it had on some of their plot lines, which attests to its production value. The sub plot which unfolds between Kenneth Moore and Dana Wynter is also written superbly. A good war time semi documentary that's worth seeing.",
