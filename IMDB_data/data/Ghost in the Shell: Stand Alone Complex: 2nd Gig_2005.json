Every episode is an absolute gem, much like a little techno-thriller feature film.\n\nIt's a real pity cyberpunk fiction never really made much impact in the film world - but this series makes it all work.\n\nApparently set in a world where Motoko Kusanagi never met the Puppet Master, this series involves complex political intrigue, cyber-crimes, people being hacked as one would hack a computer nowadays, etc.\n\nIf you even remotely liked the Ghost in The Shell feature film, check this out if you get the chance.",
