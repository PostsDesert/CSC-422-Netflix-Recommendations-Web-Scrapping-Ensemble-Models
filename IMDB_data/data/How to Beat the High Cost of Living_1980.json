It wasn't really to bad, a bunch of women who are having money problems decide to pull a heist by taking a large ball full of money in a shopping mall. It isn't a hilarious movie but it DID have it's moments. It's a fun movie to see if you like chick flicks AND heist movies-this combines the two and comes up with something, if not great, at least watchable.\n\nMy main problem with this is how it doesn't really stick in your mind once you've seen it. It is sometimes funny but never really hilarious. The movie is watchable but never really great. It doesn't come close to being a great movie but is, all in all, a decent one that's good for a few laughs.",
