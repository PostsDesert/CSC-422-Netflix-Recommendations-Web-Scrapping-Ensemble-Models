        "reviewBody": "The Michael Meyers figure in the mask is more sinister than ever in this better than average remake of the original HALLOWEEN movie. It's a slasher that has enough real thrills for anyone who wants to see the gore and many plot twists and turns.\n\nDONALD PLEASANCE is still Dr. Loomis, alerting the police that Meyers has escaped and is back in Haddonfield looking to murder his niece, DANIELLE HARRIS. Harris is a wonderful child actress who looks genuinely frightened throughout the story and convincingly goes through the paces, as do all the other members of an excellent cast. ELLIE CORNELL and SASHA JENSON do well as the conventional teen-aged leads.\n\nIf slasher films of this genre are your thing, this is a better script than you might expect from this franchise.\n\nOn the other hand, if you've seen the original film with Jamie Lee Curtis, there's an awful lot of familiarity in the plot line. But as a Halloween slasher, it delivers the goods. \n\nSumming up: Probably one of the best sequels in this series.",
