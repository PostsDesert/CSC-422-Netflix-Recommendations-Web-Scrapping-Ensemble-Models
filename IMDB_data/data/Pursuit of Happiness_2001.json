We have even had the same type of history of hooking up each other with friends and talked late into the evening about relationships. She falls very much in the line of Franks character in that she just jumps from one relationship to the next. I just felt that the script was right on and the characters were very well played. If you are dealing with something like this I definatly suggest this movie. And it's really good even if your not.\n\nIf you want to chat about movies (this one or others feel free to e-mail me - my names Chad)",
