Being a huge fan of the first two films, it is really sloppy! And I do not mince words! By analyzing many parts of the film, we see that the filmmakers have taken parts one and two films in the series ... RIDICULOUS! When I started the film, I wondered if it was not a remake of two comic actors were playing so poorly.\n\nI'm so done everything to get them to my belief that the sequences (3 and 4) would be tempting that I am even more disappointed!
