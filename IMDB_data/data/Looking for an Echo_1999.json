        "reviewBody": "\"A place to live in harmony, a place we almost found.\" Kenny Vance\n\nIn 1964, I used to hang around a bar in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn (where \"Looking...\" is set). I wasn't from the neighborhood, but they'd let me in even though I was but seventeen - the legal age at that time was eighteen. Most Fridays would find me at the bar, drinking and listening to the bar band play...and sing. It was obvious that the band guys could sing, but they were singing stuff like \"Wooden Heart,\" maybe a Beatles tune or two - nothing that you could call doo-wop. \n\nI began to bug the band with taunts like, \"Hey, why doncha sing some harmony, man!?\" and when they weren't performing I would talk to them a bit. They were local guys. One night after their set, after they'd heard one too many jibes from me, they dragged me into the men's room and sang some very nice harmony. They really hit some notes and I never taunted them again.\n\n\"Looking For An Echo\" reminds me of those days. I found myself singing along to the harmony parts of \"Please Say You Want Me,\" a song much-loved and covered in mid-1960s Brooklyn and Queens. And also, of course, that latter-day hymn to harmony, \"Looking For An Echo.\"\n\nA kind of musically oriented \"Goodfellas\" where the fellas really are good. A must-see for anyone who's ever sung a note of harmony.",
