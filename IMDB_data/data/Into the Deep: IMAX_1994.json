        "reviewBody": "After watching Into the Deep, I'm a little shocked that I'm not trashing this movie hard. It doesn't seem like it's for me. It has a very high-school-y vibe, like a romance drama for teen girls. It sometimes feels like a B-movie. And to top it off, it starts really slow and takes a while before anything actually happens.\n\nAnd yet... I found myself enjoying it. I can't explain it. Maybe it's the good musical score that kept me intrigued. Maybe I just fell in love with the lead actress 3 seconds into her screentime. Or maybe it's actually decent.\n\nI might've given this a slightly positive score, but I was turned off by a few character decisions and some really dumb moments later in the movie. Still, this is so much more entertaining than a lot of the boring and useless garbage I watch. (1 viewing, 3/24/2023)",
