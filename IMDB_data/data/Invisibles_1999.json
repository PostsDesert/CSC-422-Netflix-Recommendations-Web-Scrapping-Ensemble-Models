        "reviewBody": "I must admit that \"Invisible Child\" is a weird movie. It's about a family in LA, they live in a beautiful house and are very happy. Except for the mother,Annie Beeman (Rita Wilson) because she has imagined a third child, Maggie, who is five years old at the beginning of the movie. The father, Tim Beeman (Victor Garber) supports her, along with the others two kids, ten year old Rebecca ( nicknamed Doc ), who does know her sister isn't real and four year old Sam who doesn't know that. Anyhow, they hire a nanny, she's English and she is very confused when she learns what's going on in this household. This nanny (Tushka Bergen) tries to solve the problems the Beemans have been facing for so long, but is a long road to go...\n\n As I already said: some parts are weird because you can't figure out who's faking and who's not, but please remember: this is an AMERICAN movie -- they usually have a happy ending. My advice to you is to tape this movie if you get the chance!\n\n8/10"
