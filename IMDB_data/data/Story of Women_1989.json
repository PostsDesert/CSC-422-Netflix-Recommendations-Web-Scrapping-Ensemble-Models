        "reviewBody": "I'd like to focus on this film as a French film, not of the United States. If one has seen \"La Chagrin et la Pitie,\" then one knows the legacy of this film. France was not perfect during WWII. Not everyone in France was part of the resistance, mainly, they were trying to survive. I think its an amazing film that sheds light on a crucial point in French history. Yes, it's about abortion and Chabrol does a great job ensuring his abortionist is less than perfect. That's a wonderful point he makes, that no one is perfect, not even the moral majority of the government. But, I come away from this film with the same questions that I get from \"Lacombe, Lucien,\" which are: 'what would I have done?' And, please, don't Monday morning quarterback World War II."
