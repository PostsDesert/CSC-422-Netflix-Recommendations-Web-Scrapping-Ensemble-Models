        "reviewBody": "is a must to see. Before he became \"one of the System's bad boys\". He is refreshing and I would tell any true Steve McQueen fan to see this movie just on the strength of his performance.\n\nThe movie itself is a hoot! I mean with not so evasive homosexual references and shades of Noir...and in the early 50's!!....it is worth seeing. I liked it.\n\nIt is a story of the \"Great St. Louis Bank Robbery\" in the early 50's....great period piece for those of us who were alive then....and for those who were not to see what a section of Americana looked like....\n\nUsing the real people involved in the actual heist is great! Non-Actors who are reliving their dream or nightmare....depending.\n\nSee it. You won't be disappointed.",
