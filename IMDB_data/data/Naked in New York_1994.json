        "reviewBody": "Naked in New York is one of those always risky propositions, when \"artists\" write about the \"business\" of what they're doing, in this case the theater. Naked is one of the better examples of it, and features some nice ensemble work from Eric Stoltz, Mary Louise Parker, and Timothy Dalton.\n\nThe best moment, and the reason I'm adding a comment, is when the main character attends his first New York literary party. When he spots William Styron, he makes some snide comment to the effect of, \"What has he written?\" The movie responds by flashing Styron's works, which are considerable.\n\nIt's a great moment and a great use of the medium, and almost worth the rental price. Naked is a good one for a slow night."
