        "reviewBody": "Ridley Scott oddly took the job to direct this perfectly crafted sequel to the Oscar award winning Silence of the Lambs. After being located in Florence, Hannibal returns to America and attempts to make contact with disgraced Agent Clarice Starling.\n\nWhile not following Harris' novel to the letter and omitting a main character, Scott directs an atmospheric follow up. With David Mamet's meaty, intellectual screenplay there's plenty to like about Hannibal. There are terrific performance's nobility by Giancarlo Giannini in a subtle and memorable take on Insp. Renaldo Pazzi. Unrecognisable, Gary Oldman is astounding as Mason Verger, the heavy disfigured paedophile and Ray Liotta replaces Lamb's Ron Vawter and is on form as a sleazy F.B.I Agent, Paul Krendle.\n\nNurse Barney returns in a larger role, and of course Anthony Hopkins is back in his iconic role as Hannibal Lecter. Hopkins is given more to do and is out of his confinement (much to the announce of some film critics). Although possibly striped of some mystic, Hannibal is far more dangerous and interesting here, mingling with the general public and stalking his prey. They only thing I feel is distracting is the casting of Julianne Moore as Starling, and that is only from a continuity point of view as she delivers a gifted performance.\n\nBlade Runner's director Scott makes every shot interesting and this coupled with John Mathieson cinematography is first-rate, particularly in the Florence set ups, and US exteriors. Veteran musician Hans Zimmer's score is mystical and heightens all that is taking place on screen.\n\nAn overlooked, misunderstood and fantastic film, that is a wonderful experience to watch."
