        "reviewBody": "'The Nature Boy' Ric Flair finally gets the complete DVD treatment the former 16-time Worlds Heavyweight Champion can be proud of. The 3 Disc set includes Flair discussing his rivals, classic promos and the matches that made him a Wrestling Legend.\n\nDisc 1 consists of his NWA/WCW battles with 7-time Worlds Heavyweight Champion Harley Race, 'The American Dream' Dusty Rhodes and Barry Windham.\n\nRicky 'The Dragon' Steamboat dominates Disc 2. We see 2 matches; Clash of the Champions VI and WrestleWar '89 which are absolute classics. Flair was at his best against Steamboat here as many fans consider these matches the greatest of all time. The latter part of Disc 2 has Ric Flair Vs Terry Funk Non Title I Quit match. While not as pretty as the previous matches, it shows Flairs ability to adapt no matter who the challenger. Flair also speaks candidly on the plane crash of '75, which almost ended not only his career but his life. On a lighter note, there are 2 great segments on the group known as The 4 Horseman.\n\nThe 3rd disc shows Flair in his WWE/F days. All the promos of his buildup with Bobby 'The Brain' Heenan are here and as entertaining as ever. Flair made his impact felt very early in the WWE/F by winning The Royal Rumble in '92. It's been said that this Royal Rumble was the best ever. Back to WCW now and Clash of the Champions XXVII with Sting. To end we are shown the never before seen tribute on RAW '03 following his World Heavyweight Championship match against Triple H and the match itself.\n\nThis is a great compilation of Ric Flairs greatest matches, entertaining promos, detailed descriptions on his rivals from Flair himself and some hidden features as well. This is not only my favorite pro wrestling DVD but my favorite DVD period. Every wrestling fan should have this in their collection. Nobody is better than the 'Kiss stealin' wheelin' dealin' limousine ridin' jet fyin' son of a gun'. Woooooooooo. I've always wanted to say that.",
