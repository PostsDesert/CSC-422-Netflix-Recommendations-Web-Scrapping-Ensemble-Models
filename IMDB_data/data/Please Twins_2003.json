But to my surprise and pleasure Twins has almost nothing to do with the original, and was a refreshing experience.\n\nTwins is a balanced mix of romance and comedy. Most often there will be too much of one or the other - especially romance - and the sappiness will ruin the show. But in this case I was very pleased with the way it was presented.\n\nYou won't find the usual action/peril overkill that reside in most series, this one is for those times when you're not thirsting for violence and want to see something a little bit more sensible. I'm glad I put aside my presumptions about Twins and gave it a try. 8/10"
