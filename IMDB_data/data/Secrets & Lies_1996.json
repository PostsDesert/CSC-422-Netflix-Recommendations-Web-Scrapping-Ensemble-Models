I thought, \"That'll do for the afternoon.\"\n\nSo there I was, a 42 year old flabby man watching a mystery show for kids... And it hooked me. The first coup of episodes drew me and I really wanted to know what happened to the missing girl and what the adults knew.\n\nThe kids in this show are all fantastic, they play their roles incredibly well. The core mystery is interesting and it turns and twists well through the whole show. It's paced incredibly well, with each episode only being around 20 minutes once intro and recaps etc are done.\n\nAll in all a fantastic show that keeps the intrigue up, the pace held and turns interesting and surprising.\n\nWell worth a watch for adults... And kids too.",
