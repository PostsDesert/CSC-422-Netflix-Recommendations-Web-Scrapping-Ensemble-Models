        "reviewBody": "This is the first Pink Panther sequel I've seen, and is what I think much, much funnier and exciting than the original film. Here, he is on the trail to find the thief that stole the Pink Panther jewel.\n\nThis film features Clousseau's obsessive boss Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), who absolutely loathes Clousseau, and Cato Fong (Burk Kwok), Clousseau's servant. Both Clousseau and Fong join forces to track down the diamond, resulting in nothing but a fun crime story, adventures and non-stop physical, clumsy comedy. The fight between Clouseau and Cato in the apartment is hilarious and Dreyfus losing his mind due to Clousseau driving him insane is priceless.\n\nOverall, a sequel that is surpasses the first Pink Panther film by miles.\n\nGrade B+",
