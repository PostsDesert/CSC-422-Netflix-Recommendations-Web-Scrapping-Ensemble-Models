        "reviewBody": "I love ReBoot, thats the first thing i have to say. The show has inspired me so much, helping me make websites for fun, and inspiring me towards a career in computer animation. When ReBoot was on ABC i really wasn't a fan because it was a bit over my head. Now in my teens i am addicted to Reboot more than ever. Season 4 was a blessing to all reboot fans everywhere. The story was continued, the characters where rebuilt for a better more realistic look, and new characters where introduced as they never where before...if you've never seen reboot, you really can't apprechiate how far it's gone since its times as a saturday morning cartoon in 1994. People all over should have a chance to see this show and that is why i think Cartoon Networks Toonami should air the whole series again ( it hasn't aired it in almost a year). I have yet to see all of My Two Bobs, but let me tell you there is a huge shock in it!!",
