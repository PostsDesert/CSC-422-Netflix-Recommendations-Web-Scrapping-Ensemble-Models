I don't suppose anyone will ever read this review as the movie is over 30 years old, but I've just watched it for the first time tonight so I'm going to write a review anyway.\n\nThe good: 1. It's Rebecca De Mornay.\n\n2. It's directed by Roger Vadim who made the original movie of this title featuring the goddess Brigitte Bardot.\n\n3. Did I mention that it stars Rebecca De Mornay?\n\nThe bad: 1. No one in this movie can act.\n\n2. There is no discernible plot.\n\n3. Everyone in the movie has a horrendous 80's haircut.\n\n4. The point of the movie seems to be about Rebecca De Mornay being some sort of musical talent, but the music is awful.\n\nTo sum up; it's a terrible movie, but despite the mullet, it's still Rebecca De Mornay.",
