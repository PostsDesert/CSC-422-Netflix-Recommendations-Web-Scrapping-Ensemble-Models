Once past the intro, powerful mood. Riveting story. Well built scenario, very logical and nicely paced. Emotionally disturbing.\n\nThe actors. Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn are just perfect as antagonist. Don Harvey fits his crazy role very well. John C. Reilly plays the simpleton with convincing clarity. And I'll just mention in passing a good performance by Ving Rhames.\n\nThe bad. The initial jungle scenes lack realism, as well as some over-acting by the black guy in the first part.\n\nThe ugly. Nothing.\n\nThe result. An emotional and brutal movie. Not for the faint of heart.",
