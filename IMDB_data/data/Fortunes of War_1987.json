He is really frustrating.\n\nHis disinterest in anything she does forces her to find company elsewhere, but it is more subtle than would be portrayed today. No jumping into bed with the the first man who shows interest.\n\nIt is a very wordy drama and fractured as it passes from Rumania to Turkey to Egypt.",
