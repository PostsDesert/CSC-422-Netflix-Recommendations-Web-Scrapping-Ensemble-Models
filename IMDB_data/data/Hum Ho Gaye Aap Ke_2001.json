        "reviewBody": "Ahathian is back second time as director after his previous success of Sirf Tum. Here Fardeen Khan plays as Rishi Oberoi, a spoiled-brat of a good and rich businessman father Mr. Oberoi (Suresh Oberoi). He likes to enjoy with drinking, money and spending every night with a new girl. But he is against the ideas of marriage and family settlement which he reasons out as burdens of an independent life. Suddenly he starts running after Chandni Gupta (newly introduced actress Reema Sen) when she wins in a beauty contest. After she joins his Rishi Technology company he unknowingly starts falling in love with her and his lifestyle goes on changing slowly. The movie has a good principle, i.e. \"wealth does not last long in a family with bad responsibility\". Fardeen's role also spread a good suggestion towards the young generation - \"enjoyment is good but it must have a limitation as it affects the family\". Hum Ho Gaye Aap Ke is well in technical, performances, story, music, casting but still it was poor in box-office. Undoubtedly this is one of Fardeen's best movie, as his role is a dream for every growing youth in the modern age. They dream modern life, enjoyment, load of money and finally run one after another girl. But all these finally result to a fully ruined life.",
