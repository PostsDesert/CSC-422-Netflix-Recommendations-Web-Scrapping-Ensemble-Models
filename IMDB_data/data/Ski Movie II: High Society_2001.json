Awesome footage of your favorite skiers attacking the Coast Range of BC from a boat with a heli! Super fat tricks and unbelievable sky time in this movie too!! Tanner, Seth M., Shane (Szoces and McConkey), Mike D. and more. All I can say is wow! This movie is the best, period. Watch it today. Crazy snowmobiler, base jumping, and painful rail sliding round out this movie. Never a dull second. Watch as Vinnie D. gets twenty feet off the deck on his 720's, never-mind all the flip landed switch! This movie makes Warren Miller look like he's back on the green runs. Great music too!",
