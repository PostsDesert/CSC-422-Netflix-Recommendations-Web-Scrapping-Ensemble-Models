I just get a feeling when I see a new series...like I did when the series Castle came out. Thank God it's steaming on Hulu because I work all day Tuesday when it comes on. I like all the characters in the show, I like that the lead character has a learning disorder and does his job better than anyone else in spite of it. His partner obviously hates him for the investigation of her mother that ended her career but is forced to work with him at the request of her captain. His on and off again relationship with his female homicide officer he grew up with in foster care is interesting and to sum up, the whole thing here just works. I see this series going for a long time and I'm grateful to the people who brought this to life on ABC. Peace.",
