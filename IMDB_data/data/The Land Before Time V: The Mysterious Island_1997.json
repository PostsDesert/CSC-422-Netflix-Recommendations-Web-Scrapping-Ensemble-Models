This one and The Journey To Big Water. Even though this is a very good movie I believe that number #6 is better. It is me all time favorite. Any ways this movie is awesome and I would watch it over and over again. Its AWESOME ! ! ! The Land before time series is an amazing series.It is awesome especially for kids all ages.it tells about a mysterious land again. Which no one really knows about. And Dinosaurs every child is fascinated by dinosaurs.The songs are also magical on any movie you watch from number one to the very newest one. They all take you on a magical journey of your own.",
