        "reviewBody": "A sister and her brother, both grown, see the world in ways that are significantly different. The divorced sister and her young son live in the small town she grew up in. These are her roots. Nothing exciting happens here, but her routine life offers security and stability. One day her brother comes to visit her. The brother is something of a wanderer, moving around from place to place, unmarried, unsettled, looking for adventure. His visit sets up a clash between him and his sister and their different life styles: one sedentary, the other nomadic. In the absence of other siblings, and with both parents dead, each counts on the other to provide familial support.\n\nIt's the kind of film a lot of viewers can identify with, because most of what happens in the film is very ordinary: babysitting, plumbing hassles, time sheets, an annoying white-collar boss ... the stuff of everyday life. The emphasis is on contemporary realism.\n\nBoth Laura Linney (as the sister) and Mark Ruffalo (as the brother) were well cast for their roles. Both do a fine job of acting. The film's dialogue is realistic and believable. The country/western music is nice, but a little surprising, given that the story takes place in upstate New York.\n\nIf there is a downside to the film it is that it gets off to a slow start. Also, the story comes across at times like a soap opera.\n\nSince the brother and sister have no other adult family, the film's theme is the same as its title: \"You Can Count On Me\". The story tugs at your heartstrings, especially with that poignant ending.\n\nBecause of its relevant, contemporary premise, its character development, and the high quality in direction, cinematography, editing, casting, acting, and production design, this is a film that most viewers probably will find satisfying.",
