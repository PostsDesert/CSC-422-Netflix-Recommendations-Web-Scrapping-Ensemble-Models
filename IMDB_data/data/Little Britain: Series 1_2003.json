        "reviewBody": "I have always loved \"Little Britain\"--mostly because the show so rarely shows any sort of restraint or good taste. However, I must admit that a minor problem with the shows has been the uneven nature of them. Some skits work great again and again and again. A few, however, run a bit thin with repeated use. Fortunately, Matt Lucas and David Walliams chose wisely here--presenting only their very best skits. And, in the one case where a relatively weak one was used, it was a shining example of it at its best (such as the visit with the Pope). The bottom line is that if you love the show, you'll adore \"Little Britain Abroad\". And, if the show creeps you out or annoys you, it will surely do the same here! \n\nBy the way, perhaps the shows originally featured the skits as listed on the summary on IMDb (though I doubt it). Part one did NOT have skits involving the Prime Minister nor do you see Dudley and his bride--they are in part two. It really doesn't matter though, as both episodes are presented one after the other on the disc. Also, the special features are amazing--and make the disc well worth owning. You get an hour-long documentary about their live show in Australia, their Comic Relief show (it's ALL Matt and David) and deleted scenes (good one, actually)--a TON of extras in fact!",
