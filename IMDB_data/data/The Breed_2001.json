Even though i'd call it more of a Vampire Scifi, people who like and appreciate horror movies should definatly watch this. 6.5/10 Compared to the crap that's out there, this is one of the better ones.\n\nAbout movies in general; There's no such thing as ripping off The Matrix ,Tarantino, or any other \"ripped off\" movies. Just because it's popular, doesn't mean its original. Every movie ripps off every movie."
