        "reviewBody": "\"Malcolm in the Middle\" may have lost a bit of steam recently, but some of the earlier episodes are absolutely, side-splittingly hilarious. Although Malcolm (Frankie Muniz) may be the titular character, it is really Bryan Cranston's characterization of the father figure, Hal, that makes the show so fun to watch. Cranston turns Hal into a boy at heart (as all fathers are) - only, like everything else with the show, extends it into a complete satire and goes completely wacky. This show, for lack of a better word, is crazy.\n\nIt's absurd. And it couldn't be any better. The wild antics and over-the-top gags are similar to a cartoon, and even the fast-cut editing between scenes (with the \"whoosing\" sound) is reminiscent of an animated program.\n\nLike \"The Simpsons,\" \"Malcolm\" manages to successfully interweave everyday family/social topics into silly plots involving all types of nonsensical stuff. Some of the physical gags are absolutely hilarious - the episode with Hal running out of the supermarket, a parody of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" is gut-busting - but at its heart this really is a tender and witty comedy that manages to be effective on more than one level.\n\nThe rest of the cast are great too. It really \"feels\" like a genuine family. They bicker, they complain, they whine and moan and fight - this is America today. If we were to go back fifty years in a time capsule and present this to the \"I Love Lucy\" crowds, they'd be shocked.",
