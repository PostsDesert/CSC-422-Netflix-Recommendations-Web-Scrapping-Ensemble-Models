        "name": "A Definite Improvement Over Its Predecessor",
        "reviewBody": "A definite improvement over its predecessor, Tim Burton's Batman Returns offers welcome upgrades in several aspects to deliver a darker, stronger & better sequel that digs into its characters' emotional trauma in truly fascinating ways, and is all the more uplifted by its operatic set pieces, smart camerawork, chilling ambience & haunting score.\n\nThe film this time pits Batman against Penguin & Catwoman but the tragic angle the story takes to progress their arcs is what makes the trio and their interactions so compelling. Its over-the-top action hasn't aged well but the drama still retains its freshness & gripping quality. While it still feels like a product of its time it is at least more entertaining.\n\nAlthough the refined set pieces, sharp imagery, eerie tone & splendid score uplift the look n feel of the whole picture, performances are this time its strongest suit. Michael Keaton is more comfortable as Bruce Wayne, Danny DeVito is fantastic as Penguin but it's Michelle Pfeiffer who steals the show with her sultry rendition of Catwoman. It's a deftly layered act from all three.\n\nOverall, Batman Returns is better than Batman in more ways than one and it also appears less dated, thanks to the toned down goofiness. When it comes to action, it is as uninteresting as it was in the previous entry. However, its dramatic depth & emotional beats resonate more strongly this time around, thus making it a worthy successor to the original. If not for anything, watch it for Pfeiffer."
