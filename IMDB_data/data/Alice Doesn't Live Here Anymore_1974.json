        "reviewBody": "People forget that \"ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE\" is a Scorsese film. Look at it again and you'll see it is one hundred percent Scorsese. Totally focused on a female character. I read somewhere that Ellen Burstyn asked Scorsese \"How well do you know women\" and Scorsese replayed \"Not well at all, but I'm willing to learn\" The portrait of Alice adds something to film female characters that had never been present on the screen before. All those Joan Crawford fighting working class women seem like a joke compared to Ellen Burstyn's Alice. Jodie Foster steps into the screen with a funny, touching BANG. If you've never seen this film, hurry up! If you've seen it, see it again.",
