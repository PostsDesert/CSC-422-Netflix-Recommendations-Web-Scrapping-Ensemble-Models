        "reviewBody": "Now, I've been hearing a lot of negative reception about this movie. That it is not Tenchi or the animation is horrible, but here's what I've got to say. Well, those who say that are half right, this lacks everything the Tenchi series is, the comedy. And the animation does look worse than Tenchi In Tokyo, but it does have the characters, and the love story thing in it. And it has more background about Yosho and his history, before coming to Earth, and has a great soundtrack and musical score from Saitou Tsuneyoshi. And it is more of a romance and drama than a comedy, that is probably what turned off those Tenchi fans. But overall, it is very touching and it shows another side of Tenchi, his true feelings, and a side of Ryoko and Ayeka I've never seen before that made me feel a bit warm on the inside, but I still want to see more of their bickering and fighting over Tenchi! And the ending was just beautiful, and the music fits it perfectly. I recommend it to Tenchi fans interested in seeing something different in Tenchi. Oh, and don't think this is the end of Tenchi, because it isn't!",
