Forget Ivan Reitman's great direction and the highly suitable music of James Newton Howard. Even the notable guest appearances from senators, journalists etc.\n\nThat makes it for me one of my all time favorite movies, is the heart of its characters, especially Dave.\n\nIt's all about doing the right thing.\n\nUnfortunately almost never good people reach the highest offices. You need to be a politician. To sell yourself bit by bit, to compromise, to lie or even worst.\n\nBut what if? What if purely by chance or because the universe wanted it, a good, honest, caring man becomes the most powerful man in the world? This is the main theme of this great movie and you surely wont give it justice if you see it as a farce or a comedy.\n\nFor me this movie is a 10. I really think writers and directors should make more movies like this, instead of writing about lunatics and serial killers."
