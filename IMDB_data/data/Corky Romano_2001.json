        "reviewBody": "Chris Kattan of Saturday Night Live plays the title character in this send-up of mob movies. His character is the disowned son of the mob boss currently being investigated. While his two brothers are enforcers in the family Corky is a lowly assistant vet with aspirations of owning his own animal hospital. When it is discovered that someone in the family is turning informant and feeding the Feds information they decide that someone should go undercover in the FBI to retrieve all the incriminating evidence. Corky is picked and forced to do this. His cover is designed as that of a super-agent and suddenly he finds himself leading a few different task forces as while as trying to protect his real family. Possibly having low expectations concerning this movie helped, but there were some scenes in it that just about had me on the floor I was laughing so hard. It is well executed and Kattan is great at the physical comedy required for this role. Is this a thinking person's comedy? Not at all. This is strictly something that you watch if you want totally light fluff and don't have high expectations. Be prepared though, it just might surprise you."
