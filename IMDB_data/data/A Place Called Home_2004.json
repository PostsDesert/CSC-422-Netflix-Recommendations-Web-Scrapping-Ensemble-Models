        "reviewBody": "Ann-Margret does it again! I've been going MAD waiting for this movie and now that I've finally been able to see it I can honestly say it was WELL worth the wait! A-M only picks the winners and she truly SHINES as Tula, an aging recluse whos feistiness and strong willed personality keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film. She's mysterious, angelic, haunting, and very emotional as this character and even a non A-M lover would be interested in this one. Her chemistry with former Whorehouse co-star Gary Sandy is excellent, and the relationship between Tula and Cali (Shailene Woodley) is wonderful to watch develop. I enjoyed all the actors performances and they seemed to give it their all. The peaceful setting in Lake Tahoe is gorgeous and makes for a wonderful background & co-star in itself. I truly hope the academy of television arts and science FINALLY recognizes A-M this year with an Emmy, which she has so rightly deserved for YEARS now! This ones a winner, and A-M is AMAZZZZZING as always!!! I couldn't rave about her enough:) My only complaint is her wardrobe. Sure, she's playing an older lady, but there is a point in the film where she is made-over and well, to be honest, as gorgeous as A-M is to this day, they should have her prancing around in her trademark toreador pants again lol! Anyway check this one out. You won't want to miss it!",
