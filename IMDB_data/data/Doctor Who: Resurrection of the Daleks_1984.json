It gives a great insight into the magic of what sadly remains hidden.\n\nI'll admit the animation isn't as good as it should be, not the standard of Invasion, but it still allows you to bring the characters to life. Having read the text and listened to the audio on numerous occasions I found myself muddling some of the characters, Resno and Valmar, what this animation does is bring them to life and reinforce just who they are.\n\nYou can see that plenty of care and attention was taken to create the scene where Lesterson witnesses in horror the Dalek production line, and it's perhaps the best scene on the disc, somehow a little more work went into that one, as it is key to the plot.\n\nI invested in the colour version, but I do prefer the black and white version. I'm so glad to have it on my shelf, and the fan in me wishes that they'd release the lot, but I understand that's not viable, surely time though to put Fury from the Deep or Evil of the Daleks to the same treatment?\n\nThese stories are out there, and one day will be found, it will be interesting to look back at these and compare, or see a different interpretation.\n\nDon't look at it with an overcritical eye, see it from the view point of those wanting to give us fans something that tantalisingly remains absent.\n\nLoved it, 10/10",
