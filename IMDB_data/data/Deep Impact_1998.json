However, while the main storyline is similar, that's were the similarities end. Just because Deep Impact didn't have everything going \"BOOM\" like Armageddon did, doesn't make it a boring movie. I was caught up in the narrative, the characters and the \"heart\" in this movie. There was substance in the storytelling. Duvall excels in leading a group of young, hotshot astronauts into space.",
