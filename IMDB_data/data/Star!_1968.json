Much of the credit must go to Academy Award nominated designer Donald Brooks. The wardrobe Miss Andrews wears is both large in number (over 125 different changes) and incredibly beautiful. This is the only film that comes to mind where the costumes seen to actually turn in a performance. I cannot imagine what this film would be like without Donald Brooks' extraordinary contributuion. He along with the millions of dollars worth of Cartier jewels make this film a memorable experience. For real eye candy STAR! cannot be beat!!!"
