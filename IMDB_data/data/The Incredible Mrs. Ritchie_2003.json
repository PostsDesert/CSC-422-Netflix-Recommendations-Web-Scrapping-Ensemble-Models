        "reviewBody": "Wonderful feel good movie with veteran cast Gena Rowlands, James Caan, and David Schofield, delivering fine performances. Kevin Zegers in the key role of Charlie was also very good. The sharp contrast between Charlie's totally dysfunctional family, and Mrs Ritchie's unconditional loving family, drives the film. Lessons in forgiveness and tolerance permeate the emotionally satisfying script. Interesting parable that a family is like a garden, and needs love and attention to grow. A very quiet movie that has a lot to say about honesty and human kindness. Not necessarily a tear jerker, more of a mind stimulator, or perhaps a wake up call for your emotions. - MERK",
