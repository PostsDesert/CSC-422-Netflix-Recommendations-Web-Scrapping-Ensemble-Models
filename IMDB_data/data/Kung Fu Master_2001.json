Most, if not all, of the fight scenes are enhanced, but it is such a fast moving, whacky movie, I really enjoy it.You'll need to watch it more than once because it has a lot of characters and the plot is somewhat confusing, not too mention you need to be a speed-reader to catch all the subtitles. I recommend this movie because it is loads of fun."
