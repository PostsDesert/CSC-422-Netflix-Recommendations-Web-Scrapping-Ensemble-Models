I so hated buddy's first owner,, the stupid clown,, oh so happy when the kid decides to take action against the clown. as far as a dog playing basketball I actually wouldn't put it past an actual real life dog to do it being properly trained and all, the only thing I feel that's a little far fetched is the poor dog wearing those tiny dog slippers tell me how a golden retriever is gonna run up and down the basketball court in sneakers,, but other than that I really just loved this movie,, it's a movie for all ages 9-99. enjoy folks.",
