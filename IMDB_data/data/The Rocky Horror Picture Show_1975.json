Furter, is leading an experiment His newly made creature, the body-beautiful Rocky, is ready to be unveiled, and the innocent couple is caught up in this strange household filled with the doctor's campy, exotically dressed admirers Both the wife and the husband are seduced by this garter-belted \"scientist.\" \n\nThe film's first half is fast and funny, with virtually every song a memorable one But the second half tries to do too much and the film loses much of its potency Nevertheless, the adorable characters make this a delightful entertainment",
