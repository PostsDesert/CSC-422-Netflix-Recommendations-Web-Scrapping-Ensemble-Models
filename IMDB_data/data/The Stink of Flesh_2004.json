There is hardly any plot. The only point of the movie is that the two main characters are obsessed with internal organs. They talk about the organs endlessly. The man then gets off by doing an MRI on her and lusting after her organs. This works for a while but then looking at pictures of her organs is not satisfying enough for either of them. Hence, it is taken to the next step where he must touch her organs...and the film takes a turn from merely boring to disgusting.",
