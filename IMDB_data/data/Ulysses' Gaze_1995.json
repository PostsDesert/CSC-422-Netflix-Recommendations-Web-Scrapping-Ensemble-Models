        "reviewBody": "Somebody once said that DW Griffith is to blame for having a wide open horizon, full of possibilities, and settling for melodrama as the blueprint of the movie-going experience.\n\nHowever, once in a long while, a film comes along that breaks the mold and shows us once again what can be done. Glimpses only, hints at untapped potential. \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" is one such example. Fellini's \"Satyricon\" is another. \"Solaris\" by Tarkovsky. And so is \"Ulysses' Gaze\". There are more.\n\nI like to be challenged, even as I enjoy some standard Hollywood fare. I like to be shaken up with the promise of a nudge towards enlightenment. I love to feel awakened from my everyday, sleepwalking mode.\n\nGranted, \"Ulysses' Gaze\" is NOT for everyone. But to dismiss this film as \"another one of those art films\", to call it bloated, is an exercise in laziness. And to condemn Angelopoulos of arrogance, well, how about considering the terms confidence and conviction instead? I do not pretend to understand \"Ulysses' Gaze\", the film is so riddled with ambiguities and leaps back and forth into the realm of the subconscious and the surreal. I just allow myself to go with the flow, and regard a world that is so outside of the grid that it is like watching a transmission from another planet, with real people I identify, sharing genuine affection in small gestures. And even though the English dialogue is lacking at times, there is not a single one of those \"Hallmark moments\" that seems to pervade in contemporary Hollywood fare.\n\nAs for the prolonged landscape scenes, they show parts of the world (Albania, Bulgaria) that are as unknown to me as the bottom of the ocean. If just for this alone, I am hypnotized.\n\nTo make the effort, to absorb \"Ulysses' Gaze\", is a small step towards understanding the ruthless, constant plight of the people of that small corner of the world that is the Balkans. Just one small corner. Imagine.\n\nI have to say that \"Ulysses' Gaze\" is an incredible film, one of a few by which XX century's great cinema should (and will) eventually be regarded."
