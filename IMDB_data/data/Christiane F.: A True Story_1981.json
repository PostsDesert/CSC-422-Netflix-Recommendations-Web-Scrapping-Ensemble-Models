        "reviewBody": "\"Christiane F.\" is a bleak, harrowing look at drug abuse among Berlin youth in the 1970s.\n\nIt is perhaps the grittiest look at addiction I've ever seen on film.\n\nThe only problem is that you never really get close to the characters. You get close to what they do - and what the people around them do - but you never feel like you know the main character that well.\n\nPart of the power of the movie comes from the casting of an actress who looks every bit as young as the character she's playing. You see her come precariously close to danger so many times, but the movie would be much more gripping if we were able to get closer to her.\n\nThe movie has many nauseating scenes of drug use and the sickness that results from it. I couldn't help thinking that this would be a good movie to show to kids to turn them off drugs. I actually felt physically ill while watching parts of it.",
