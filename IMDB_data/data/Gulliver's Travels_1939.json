        "reviewBody": "Just throw any negative comments you read here from IMD comment contributors in the wastebasket. I don't know what they were smoking.\n\nGulliver's Travels is beautiful! It is just as beautiful now as it was 60-plus years ago when it premiered, perhaps even moreso with the wonderful restoration we have now on DVD. This film doesn't have to compete with anything by Disney, and I don't see how this story has anything to do with Snow White. It stands on its own two feet as a captivating and charming classic story that children can enjoy over and over again, made when animation was really animation, and all the cells were handpainted by artists, instead of slopped together on boring, cookie-cutter computer models.\n\nThe storyline is perfect and has an anti-war undertone that was a bit daring for its time, made on the eve of World War Two. Even Disney's Snow White didn't have the guts to do that! So kudos to the Fleischer Brothers!\n\n The songs are all wonderful and the soundtrack sounds marvellously enhanced on the new DVD version. \"We're All Together Now\", \"All's Well\", \"It's A Hap Hap Happy Day\", \"Bluebirds In The Moonlight\", and especially the haunting \"Come Home Again, Sailor Man\" are all perfect and flow into the action of the film, instead of being placed there with no relevance just to try and get a hit song. These sheet music pieces always sell well on Ebay, highlighting the fact quite clearly that this is one of the most beloved animation movies of all time.",
