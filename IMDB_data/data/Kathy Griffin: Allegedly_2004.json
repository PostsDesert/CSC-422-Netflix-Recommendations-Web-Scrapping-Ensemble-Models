        "reviewBody": "Okay.. I never really liked her until I saw her Bravo Special a year ago.. now I love her and think she is unbelievably funny. Her DVD is well worth whatever it costs you.. if you like to laugh from deep inside and smile till it hurts.. this is for you.. go .. go now.. get it. She covers a lot of celebrity turf and manages to keep her show moving rapidly.. a challenge most celeb comics cant do.. if you like her reality show you will love the DVD.. and I recently saw her at the DC improv and she killed for 2 hours straight.. I think it runs 86 minutes in length and costs like 10 bucks at tower records..or best buy. Also.. you should watch her reality show on bravo. I never.. NEVER write reviews for IMDb.. but i loved her so much on this DVD.. i actually created an account to do so! Happy Viewing!",
