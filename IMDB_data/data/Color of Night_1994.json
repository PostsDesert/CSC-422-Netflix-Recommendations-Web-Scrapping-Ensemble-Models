        "reviewBody": "Bruce Willis is brilliant as a psychologist, and Scott Bakula does a great job too in his role. Actually, the main reason I rented this movie was to see these two and what they did with their characters. The other actors, mainly Lance Henriksen, do some decent work and keep the story interesting, and even intriguing to a point.\n\nOkay, so this movie has some skin in it - and I did get the directors cut - it's the only way to go...\n\n:)\n\nJane March is alright to look at, but as someone already pointed out, her teeth stand out a bit. She doesn't get that much screen time however, and the story basically revolves around Willis and his trying to find Bakula's killer.\n\nThe ending of the film (the last ten minutes or so) let the film down It almost borders on ridiculous; not due to the realization that is reached, but the action that takes place. \n\nDespite this, it's definitely worth seeing for the great acting by Willis and the truly 'whodunnit' type feel.\n\n[7/10]",
