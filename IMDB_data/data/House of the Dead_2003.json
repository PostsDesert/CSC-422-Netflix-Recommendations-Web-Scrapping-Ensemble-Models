        "reviewBody": "Actually reasonably enjoyable, but in a comic book, silly kinda way. This is by no stretch of the imagination a good movie in any sense, but you cant help but laugh yourself silly through most of it. \n\nPlot line is this: A group of ravers travel to an island near Seattle, an island known as Isla del Morte (Island of the dead, and my Spanish spelling is likely incorrect). Once they arrive, they find the biggest rave of the year deserted. Why? they find out once they stumble upon survivors and are shown video footage of what happened. \n\nThis is really an elementary movie, poorly written by Mark Altman (who did one of my favorite films, \"Free Enterprise\") and equally poorly acted by the mainly unknown cast. Along with Jurgen Prochnow, Ellie Cornell (\"Halloween\" 4 & 5) and Clint Howard (Ron's brother) are the only names I recognized. I really don't expect much from Clint (and he certainly delivered in that area) but Ellie and Jurgen usually do a little better than they showed here.\n\nJohnathan Cherry is really dull as Rudy, Tyron Leitso's Simon is an irritating little weasel, Ona Grauer's Alicia is really nice to look at, but not much else...so on and so forth.\n\nLots and lots of pop culture references, including a mention of George A. Romero and the possibility of a 4th \"Dead\" film. See this one if you're a Romero fan...please...its a zombie movie and if the industry thinks thats what we want, then we'll get George's final vision that much sooner. \n\nThis is just not a good movie, but if you're like me and enjoy giving the \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" treatment to bad films, you should see this one. \n\n1/2 out of 5"
