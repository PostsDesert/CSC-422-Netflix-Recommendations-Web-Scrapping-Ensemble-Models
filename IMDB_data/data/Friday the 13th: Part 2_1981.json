        "reviewBody": "This is one of the weakest entries of the franchise in my opinion. It also doesn't fit in with the other films. Some things just make no sense. The opening for instance has Jason killing the films first survivor a few months after the first film. Heres the problem with that he's fully grown, he somehow knows where she lives and travels to her house. Cut to 5 years later and a group of counselors are trying to open up a camp and start being stalking and slashed by a hooded Jason. Amy Steel stars as Ginny one of the franchise's smartest and most bad ass heroines. The movie is fun but it's so by the numbers and the finale leaves one of the biggest questions of the series. What happened to Paul?\n\n3/5",
