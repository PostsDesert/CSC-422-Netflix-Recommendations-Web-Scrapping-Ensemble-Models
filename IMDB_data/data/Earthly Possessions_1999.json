        "reviewBody": "When I think of Susan Sarandin I think of a hip, sexy, woman with no reserves about anything. It was really interesting to see her play a character so totally opposite. In this she is a virtual recluse in a town she has never left since girlhood, a non-Christian married to a Minister! On the day she plans to take her money from the bank and run she is taken hostage by(Jake) played by actor Stephen Dorff,a very appealing guy! . \n\nHere is Susan, dressed as a frump ,trapped and in tow, by a confused and possibly dangerous handsome guy fresh out of prison. Their interaction and eventual meshing of opposites is FUN to experience in their day by day relationship. The situations are sometimes heartfelt, or sexy, or scary! \n\nBy the end, we see Susan as we all know Susan,dressed in red boots and a mini -skirt. \n\nAll the time through the film, Stephen Dorff's inner violence ,just under his calmer surface, smolders. What is he capable of? Is he mellow? Or a tiger? \n\nThere is a surprise \"almost end\" (I thought it was the end,) to the film that blows your mind, and it positively shocked me. \n\nYou need to see this movie. Maybe you can find it on eBay or Half.com. I hope so. I think you will enjoy it .",
