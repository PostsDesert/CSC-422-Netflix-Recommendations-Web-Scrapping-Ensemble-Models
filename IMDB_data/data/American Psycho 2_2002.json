I could not relate or get this movie like i did the sequel. I didn't like American psycho at all, i thought it was to gory and to graphic. I didn't get it until i read one of the comments on this site, it was all in his head, and now everyting makes sense. American psycho 2 was a good movie, but it didn't go along with the the original. it would have been better off as its own movie."
