        "reviewBody": "I loved this movie. I found myself glued to it. The leading role is autobiographical and written and directed by Frank Ripploh. Sort of a documentary approach of the life of Frank as a charming schoolteacher by day and a sex driven zany rascal of a guy by night. He's something else. There are very explicit sex scenes that certainly were not repulsed by the actors. Bravo for that. And Mr. Ripploh dosen't have any shortcomings where it counts. We are aware from the start just what we're in for with this movie. I understand it caused much controversy in the 80s when it first came out. I guess because of the sex scenes. But, that's Frank. He's honest. I liked the guy Bernd Broderup who played his lover. At first a pick up, then a live in partner. He had some nice scenes, notably the ice skating scene where they dance together on the pond. And then there's the gas station attendant who finally gets our hero in such a graphic sex scene, I was dumbfounded. But you have to see for yourself what I mean. Go rent this VHS. It's quite an experience. One that stays with you."
