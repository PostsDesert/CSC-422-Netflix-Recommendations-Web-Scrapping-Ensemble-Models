        "reviewBody": "A very shaky camera follows leatherclad 'Nam vet Herschell (Steve Hawkes) down the Florida turnpike, where he helps Angel, a stranded, bible quoting \"seeker of the truth\" in hot pants. The two go back to her place, where a hippie drug party hosted by Angel's cute, baby-voiced \"far out\" sister Anne is taking place. When Herschell ignores the advances of a woman, she informs him, \"You' re nothing but a dumb b***ard who doesn't know where it's at, anyway!\"\n\nHerschell ends up getting a job at the father's turkey farm, Anne gets him \"hooked\" on pot and scientists in lab jackets trick him into eating chemicals that transform him into a turkey headed monster that gobbles, hangs people upside down, slits their throats and drinks the blood, all while dressed in flared bell-bottom pants!\n\nOne very blood, standout murder scene has a guy getting his leg cut off with a table saw. Some real turkeys are beheaded, too, for additional gore. But the action stops cold when the on-screen, chain-smoking narrator (played by director Grinter) reads preachy, pro-Christian commentary off of cue cards on a desk!\n\nThe big, muscular Hawkes sports Elvis hair, thick sideburns and weird, blotchy skin, and is one of the worst actors I can think of. Other cast members flub or forget their lines and often look directly at the camera and laugh! No one is credited with writing it on the version I have (the original VHS copy), but with lines directed toward Hawkes like, \"He's strong, he's handsome and he enjoys being attractive to the opposite sex,\" I strongly suspect he had his hand in there somewhere.\n\nDo NOT miss this movie!\n\nScore: (technically speaking) 1 out of 10 / (for laughs) 10 out of 10!",
