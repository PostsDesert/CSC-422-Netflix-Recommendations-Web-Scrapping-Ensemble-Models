The one of SRK's item song really got me to go and watch the film. I sat through the first 20 - 30 minutes...bored. Then it picks up. The ending is very ironic. This movie is very hyping. My ratings for this movie are 1) Story - 9/10; 2) Direction - 7/10 (The Weaker point); 3) Performances - 8/10; 4) Character Development - 8/10; 5) Overall - 8/10. In my point of view, this movie is nice. If you're not such a big fan of thrillers, then this is not for you to watch because it is...well... it's a thriller.",
