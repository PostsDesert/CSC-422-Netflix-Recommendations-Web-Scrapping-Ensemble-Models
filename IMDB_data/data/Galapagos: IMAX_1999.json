She looks into the glass basins containing specimens and laughs as though they're funny but she makes no attempt to tell us what they are, and the camera makes no attempt to let us look at them. \n\nThe cameraman was obviously taken with the lovely legs of the female biologist, but some of us would have enjoyed a couple of close-ups of the many many creatures the submersible suctioned up from the ocean floor.\n\nSome good tortoise shots and a good explanation of how cactus trees evolved to be tall, but this movie wasted a lot of potential. Unless you're a leg man, of course.",
