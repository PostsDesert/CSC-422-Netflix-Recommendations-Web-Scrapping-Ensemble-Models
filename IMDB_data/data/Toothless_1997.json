She hates her job at first, but ends up getting involved in the lives of the kids. This is a big no-no, because it's against the rules to meddle, and her boss (Played wickedly by Lynn Redgrave)is just itching to have her punished. The Punishment? A one way trip to Hell (In a Hellivator, I guess). In the end, Alley learns to care for others and to allow herself to love. This was actually better than I thought it would be and is fun for all ages. Worth a rental or to add to your collection. Great performances by pretty much everyone and a great directing job by Melanie Mayron."
