He didn't do anything to deserve that spot and boy did the fans know it. They booed his arse out of Madison Square Garden and quite rightfully so. Rose was banned from Baseball for a betting scandal.\n\nIt was nice seeing the old superstars coming back like Tito Santana, Bobby Heenan and 'Superstar' Billy Graham. It was nice seeing John Studds' family and the much loved Junk Yard Dogs family there. Unfortunately John Studd died in 1995 with cancer and the JYD died in 1998 after being in a car crash.\n\nOverall Grade - A",
