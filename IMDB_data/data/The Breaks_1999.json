Derrick (\"White Mike\" from \"Martin\"), accompanied by his best friend Chris (\"Cole\" from \"Martin\") adventure around the neighborhood, chased by Cops and Thugs, in search of a carton of milk... There are not only several side-stories to enjoy here, developing snippets of ideas from other movies (\"I'm Gonna Get You Sucka\", \"Friday\", \"Pulp Fiction\"), but there are countless guest stars from other \"day in the hood\" type movies, as well as from the rap, funk, and basketball worlds... If you like Friday, CB4, Fear Of A Black Hat, Don't Be A Menace To Society, Who's The Man, etc...You owe it to yourself to check out \"The Breaks\".\n\nI give it an 8/10 (with only Fear Of A Black Hat getting a higher score from me in this genre)",
