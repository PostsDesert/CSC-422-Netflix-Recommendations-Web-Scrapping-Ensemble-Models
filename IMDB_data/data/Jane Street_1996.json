        "reviewBody": "Kim Wolf (Linda Hoffman) takes an apartment on Jane Street that was arranged by her married, manipulative boss, Marshall Catlin (D.K. Kelly) and soon also becomes his lover. She tells Sarah (Carrie Stevens) her office friend about recurring dreams that she is having in which a girl named Danielle (Gabriella Hall) is threatened by drowning. Jay Lewis (Robert Grant) is a handyman around the apartment who tries to help Kim solve her dream mystery. The story constantly implies that Marshall or his wife Penelope (Terry Markwell) may have something to hide that is somehow related to Kim's dreams.\n\nThe movie had a good role for Playboy POM (Miss June, 1997) Carrie Stevens who usually gets only a couple of lines and then dies [e.g., Sins of Desire (1993)]. She played the role well and should be rewarded with more significant roles in the future.",
