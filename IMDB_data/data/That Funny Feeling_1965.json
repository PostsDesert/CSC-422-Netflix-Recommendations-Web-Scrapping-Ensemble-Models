        "reviewBody": "That Funny Feeling marked the last film that husband and wife Sandra Dee and Bobby Darin made together. Soon after this they split, but the passion was so strong they never remarried.\n\nI'm thinking that around this time Rock Hudson was getting set to depart from Universal and I'm sure the studio thinking was that Darin and Dee could step right into the shoes of Hudson and Doris Day. Ten years earlier Rock and Doris would have made this film no doubt about it.\n\nSandra lives in a cracker box apartment with her friend Nita Talbot when she meets man about town Darin. Among other things Dee does to make the rent is clean apartments and she cleans Darin's though she never met him. Not knowing who he is, she pretends that his apartment is her's while Darin is supposed to be away on business.\n\nThe business he's on is trying to protect and hide the assets of his boss Donald O'Connor in the Tony Randall role, to wit some modern art paintings, hideous to some, valuable to others from being part of a divorce settlement. After this film gets positively zany in the Rock and Doris tradition.\n\nO'Connor has some of the best lines in the film. I suppose had the Rock&Doris type comedies stayed in vogue O'Connor might have had a second career in these parts. A lot of other familiar faces dot the supporting cast, again like a Rock and Doris flick.\n\nDarin even sings the title song over the credits of That Funny Feeling. What more could you want?",
