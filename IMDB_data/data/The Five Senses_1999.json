She was good in \"The Sweet Hereafter\" and very engaging in this movie. The rest of the cast was equally good. I do have a problem with the title. I kept thinking this character is this sense and this one is that sense which distracted me from the unfolding stories. I think a more generic title like \"Sense\" would have been better. The ending was unexpected.",
