        "reviewBody": "During his lifetime, Walt Disney made a number of serious-minded movies for family audiences, but quite often families ignored them and favored his goofball comedies and animated movies. \"Those Calloways\" is one such movie, not doing very well at the box office. Though I personally liked the movie, I can see why not many people were attracted to it. It's a long movie for one thing, over two hours in length. And the storytelling is kind of episodic than being one strong story. Still, I found the movie to have a lot of charm. It's shot on attractive New England locations, the characters are interesting, and the various vignettes are not boring. That is, if you are a (patient) adult. Though Disney intended this movie for a family audience, I think most modern day kids would be bored stiff by this movie with its slow pace and lack of action and special effects. Too bad - kids might learn a few things along the way."
