Most of the scathing, heated comments are left by men, while the praising and positive ones are left by women. That should leave you with this logical conclusion. This is not a movie that most men will enjoy. This is a movie primarily aimed at single women (although I'm married and I found it amusing). Also, I realized that for some reason, people just can't seem to resist comparing this to \"There's Something About Mary.\" I could be wrong, but I don't think this is supposed to be a sequel or anything of the sort, so why compare? It's two different movies. If you're a single female, who likes to have fun and not take things so seriously, I would highly recommend this movie. If you're male or of the Ethan Frome-type movie goer--then this is not for you. Enjoy.",
