        "reviewBody": "A grand, grand film from the master of early, somewhat daring comedies! Delightful is the word to describe this gem which sparkles with great dialogue and pure elegance. The master of the suave sophisticate, Herbert Marshall, is wonderful as the gentleman thief. This type of part was his forte in his early career and he was ill-used later on by Hollywood. Nobody looked better in evening dress or could deliver a double entendre with such perfection. Kay Francis is her soigne best as the target of the jewel thieves.....although she could not pronounce her \"r\"s, she was the personification of chic and designers had a field day dressing her for her films. Miriam Hopkins may not have been the best choice for the part of Marshall's partner in crime; she never seems quite in sync with the rest of the cast. She had a reputation for being difficult and it shows just a bit here.....but that does not take anything away from the overall excellence of this movie. The censors had not cracked down in 1932 like they would in the coming years and this allows for some risque situations (for the time) which are pure delight. \"Trouble in Paradise\" is a true gem which, although somewhat dated, further enhances the Lubitsch reputation for quality film making."
