        "reviewBody": "WOW! I just watched an absolutely brilliant film on HBO tonight. \"The Girl in the Cafe\" stars Bill Nighy and Kelly Macdonald in what I am sure will be one of the very best films of the year.\n\nThe film will, with 100% certainty, appeal to those who loved \"Lost in Translation\" and it will probably resonate with many of those who didn't like the characters in that film as much as the rest of us.\n\nThe two characters in this film are adorable, seemingly mismatched and yet a perfect relationship forms. Nighy & Macdonald deliver Oscar worthy performances... it is shame that this TV movie won't qualify!!! The film is also rife with political intelligence at it is set against the backdrop of a summit being held in Reykjavik, Iceland.\n\nThis is a spectacular screenplay, delicately balanced and bittersweet, insightful and poignant.\n\nTHE GIRL IN THE CAFE is superb in every way.\n\nLook for it on HBO right now!!! I believe it plays twice on the 28th and will assuredly be repeated many times this month!!!",
