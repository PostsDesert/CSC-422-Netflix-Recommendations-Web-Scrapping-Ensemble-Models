I remember working at my dad's San Leandro restaurant as a young jerk and loving the sound of the Kenny Loggins' \"I'm Alright\" theme song as they played Caddyshack on the big screen TV's in between sports games. That friggin' song made me wanna jump down and rock out, baby!\n\nCaddyshack isn't so much a movie as it is an excuse for a bunch of one liners, gross outs, and stand-up comedy schtick. Chevy Chase, Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield were at their funniest in this movie.\n\nIn fact, this movie was made back when Chevy Chase WAS still funny. Remember those days? Man, was that a while ago. I read an article recently where a reporter asked Chevy, \"What happened to your career?\" And Chevy looked totally pained and wounded at that cruel question. Chevy's a great comic actor, he just needs to track down another decent script like the one in Caddyshack and get his comic chops back on track. But I dig everything about this film, the background music, the great comedy gags, the gopher, even the look of the ritzy, snob ridden country club setting! Freeze gopher!"
