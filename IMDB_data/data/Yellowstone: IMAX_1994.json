        "reviewBody": "This is an IMAX movie about the human history and the natural beauty of the iconic park. The human part starts in prehistoric native times advancing to John Colter in 1806 who was a member of the Lewis & Clark expedition and various other white explorers over the years. The natural beauty is undeniable. The camera going into Old Faithful is a little bit disappointing visually but it's still a very cool idea.\n\nThis is a half hour show. I never saw it on the big screen. I would change a couple of things. The narrators could be better. None of the voices sparkle and quite frankly, a modern one would have celebrity voices. This is a slightly earlier IMAX movie and they probably played it at your city's science center. The other issue is the human actors. They seem to be all amateurs which is not the worst problem since they don't have speaking lines. There is one scene where it becomes a bad silent film comedy. The bear breaking into the camp was probably a good idea but if they can't make it funny, they should make it scary. At the end of the day, I love the nature shots, the animals, and I don't mind the history lesson.",
