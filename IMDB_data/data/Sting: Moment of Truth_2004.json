The movie is a thinly veiled commercial for Jesus. This low budget flick was just like Ted Dibiase's book \"Every Man Has His Price\" with the search for Christ over shadowing the story wrestling fans want to see. The wrestling in the film is wrapped around \"The Message\" in archive WCW clips and \"re-created\" matches that are done in an empty room with a wrestling ring or with TNA help. 1 match has Stinger confronting Abyss for the WCW World Title (WTF?). As good quality as a student film, but the legend of Sting deserves better.",
