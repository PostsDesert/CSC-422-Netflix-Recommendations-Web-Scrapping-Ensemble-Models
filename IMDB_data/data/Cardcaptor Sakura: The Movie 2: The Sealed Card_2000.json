        "reviewBody": "This is the second movie of the CCS series and possibly the last, but hey, it ended beautifully. I never saw the first one, but this one, whoa, is great, and touching. Sure it is from CLAMP, and it seems too cute and disturbing, but still, you gotta love this. After the last episode Li goes back to Hong Kong, but comes back for a vacation, and in time for the Nadesico Festival. And it seems to be a happy reunion, and all looks well, as Sakura may be able to answer back to Li, but there always seem to be something in the way, is it another card? It looks like it is, and what's a girl to do? Capture it. But this seems to be a very tricky card unlike the rest. Overall great animation compared to the series, great songs, especially the one in the middle when everyone is getting ready for the festival. And really love the ending song by Chaka, Tomorrow's Melody, I think that's what it's called, forgive me if it's the wrong title. But overall very good, good enough that even the kids could watch, not much of that supposed \"gay\" or \"lesbian\" stuff that most guys in the US say there is, and not very much violence at all, and not very disturbing as an anime fan might think there is, since this is a CLAMP title. And you'll find the ending very touching and nice. Really cute, not the sickening cute. Recommended to fans of the series, and to kids and adults alike, and to non-anime fans who don't know anime yet, forget Naruto or Ragnarok.",
