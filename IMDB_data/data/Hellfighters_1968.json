        "reviewBody": "The screenplay is quite derivative and a bit reactionary: when his \"son\" plays around ,the perfect lady killer,it's all right,but when it's the boss's own daughter ,well...but do not panic,they're married!The final scenes are simplistic :the guerrilla band is the villains-we hardly see them anyway- and the local army is not always up to scratch .\n\nI do not think that this story does the courageous \"Hellfighters\" who risk their life at every mission justice .It's a pleasure to see Vera Miles ,even in a predictable part.Katherine Ross is really lovely.But the story lacks substance ,something which would make us care for these characters:and in a movie when life is at stake ,it's downright embarrassing."
