        "reviewBody": "GRAND THEFT AUTO (2+ outta 5 stars)\n\nPretty minor car crash movie from the peak of the car crash movie boom of the mid-to-late-70s. Notable as the directorial debut of star Ron Howard... so producer Roger Corman deserves some credit for the later *good* movies that Howard directed. Actually, this movie isn't bad at all... if you like this sort of thing... cornball plot about 2 young kids in love stealing a Rolls Royce and heading for Vegas to get hitched. Egged on by a loudmouth radio broadcaster who sees the ratings potential, the pair head west... followed by the law and an assortment of comical character actors who want to stop them. Last major film role for Ron Howard... who probably sensed that time was running out on his ability to keep playing these clean-cut teenager roles.",
