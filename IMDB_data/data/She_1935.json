        "reviewBody": "I seen the 1935 version of She some time ago and found it quite enjoyable.\n\nA party heads for the frozen wastes of the Arctic to look for a lost land and its secret. On their way, they find a frozen Sabre-Tooth Tiger in the ice and then arrive there. When they get there, they find the land is ruled by a mysterious Queen known as She. She believes one of the party is her long lost lover as he looks like him. There is an earthquake at the end and the party head back home.\n\nShe is shot well in black and white and Hammer remade this in 1965 with Bond girl Ursula Andress as She.\n\nThe cast includes Western star Randolph Scott, Helen Mack (Son of Kong), Nigel Bruce (before his role as Watson in the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes movies) and Helen Gahagan as She (this was her only movie).\n\nShe is worth watching if you get the chance. A treat.\n\nRating: 4 stars out of 5.",
