This video is full of laughs, tears, memories, all in one. 30 years & still going strong Barry captures the fans & pulls on your strings all over again . And he shares some private stuff like his memories of growing up in Brooklyn Ny & a record of him & his grandfather. Not to mention he sings a duet with a fan name Michelle (who honestly I thought she would have a stroke on stage). All in all I'm willing to bet that most of the votes on here are from woman, If you are into early Manilow or just looking for a trip down the 1970's lane then this is for you. If you love \" Mandy, this ones for you, daybreak, even now, cant smile with out,\" or you wanna see a concert where fans join in, this movie is for you. If you never been to a Manilow concert & wanna see him before he dies, this movie is for you. My vote 10 stars out of 10. And just so you know I'm female & this bought up so many memories I found myself crying to these songs :)",
