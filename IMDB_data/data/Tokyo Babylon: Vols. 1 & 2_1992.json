        "reviewBody": "Well, I just bought the DVD to this movie a couple of days ago. The story goes that there is a few murders going around at a specific work sight where a new building is almost finished. Then we have Subaru come in who is trying to figure out who is killing who. Or if every \"murder\" is by pure accident. There soon is a twist of magical powers and a red dragon (dragon of the earth) that is trying to take over someones body. There is a second part to this movie which again follows Subaru on a hunt to find out who is committing certain train station murders. A woman who can see what happened with these murders gets involved with the killer. Although the second part of Tokyo Babylon doesnt follow as much towards \"X\" it does explain some of the characters. I really injoyed watching this film. Eventhough I had already seen \"X\" before this prequel I still learned a few more things about the story. And for the person who says they need a life, I think you do. The reason you did not like this film is probably most likely because you where not paying atention or understanding any part of the story line or its plot."
