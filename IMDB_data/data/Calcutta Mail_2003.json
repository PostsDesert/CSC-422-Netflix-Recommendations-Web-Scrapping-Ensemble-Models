Rani Mukherji had no really important role; she was just a supporter/admirer of Anil. Manisha had a better role. The first half was badly made. People were running after other people and randomly killing. I don't know what was going on in the first half because the story was not revealed until the second half. Once it was revealed, it became much more interesting. However, by then, I had lost interest.",
