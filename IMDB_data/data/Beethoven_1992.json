I made an IMDb account just so I could make a review to defend this film as I was shocked to see it had such a low rating when in reality this film is an all time classic. Understanding the bond between man and animal really helps you tie into the emotional connection the family has with the dog.\n\n10/10 as a family film / comedy. Will be watching with my kids for sure and you should too.",
