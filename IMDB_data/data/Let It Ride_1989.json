Let me tell you though, stranded on the island with only one movie available, I want it to be this uplifting film. It may not be my favorite, but I can easily watch it beginning to end and start it right over. The cast each grasped the characters to perfection, with one a better loser than the next! Looking for a little pick-me up, give Jay Trotter and Let It Ride one chance. Although you may still be embarrassed to mention you love it in front of your friends, I bet you will!"
