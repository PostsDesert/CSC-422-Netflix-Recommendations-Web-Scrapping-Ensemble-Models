My friends all saw FF at Newcastle so when I found this DVD I thought I could finally see what I missed out on.\n\nThe answer is s***loads!\n\nThe main gig is immense. The set they play is superb, playing the best from the FF back catalogue and stuff from One by One live from Toronto. (Look out for the masses of crowd surfers!) The extras just add to an already perfect flavour. 4 acoustic tracks played in Washington DC (if u havent heard the acoustic everlong - u havent lived!), 2 tracks from Slane Castle, and the audio set of Reykjavik (i'm told thats in Iceland).\n\nSuperb! Any FF fan who doesnt own this has no life\n\n10/10",
