The other three clips included are karma Police, High and dry and Fake plastic trees. The 7 clips on the DVD run for just over half an hour.\n\nThough it would've been great if there were extras like interviews about each clip, but otherwise you still get 7 outstanding video clips from their most influential albums, The Bends and OK computer. \n\nI would've given it a 5 if there was extras added on, but it's a must for fans of the band, though others may be disappointed with the bare bones on the DVD.\n\n4/5",
