No shooting just yakking with a gun pointed. It'll be interesting to see what comes next for this sloppy drunk and sluttier Zero Woman.\n\nWhat you will not find in this installment is action. She shoots just two bullets. Take that out and you have a Lifetime movie. Well, I guess you would also have to take out the shower scene, a haircut, and the drunken alley scene. And, maybe the whole transvestite thing. I guess it won't work.\n\nSo, we are just left with a no action mess. Find another.",
