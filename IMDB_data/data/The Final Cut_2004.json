With a few extra minutes expanding on those two, the film might have been more fleshed out. Overall, I enjoyed the movie. It really gave us pause to reflect on the pros and cons of the \"Zoe Implant\" and \"rememories.\" Appreciated the intense acting abilities of Williams and Caviezel; otherwise, the movie might have lagged even more. \n\nI thought the angles of the camera shots were interesting."
