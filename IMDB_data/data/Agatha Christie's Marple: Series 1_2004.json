        "reviewBody": "I have to disagree with one of the other reviewers comments on the actresses playing Ms. Marple. First of all, comparing it with the Poirot series featuring David Suchet is quite unfair since Suchet's character as a famous detective is always on the forefront of the stories, as in the books. Ms. Marple, on the other hand, is an amateur and an old lady, a more overlooked person who works in the background.\n\nGeraldine McEwan is by far the better of the two actresses playing Ms. Marple in this series. She has the right wit and looks as if she is enjoying every moment, her eyes sparkle when she has an idea. Who ever decided to have Julia McKenzie succeed her, when McEwan decided to drop out of the series (probably for health reasons), must have been out of his mind. They are completely different personalities, and while McEwan looks mischievous, McKenzie looks as if she has terrible toothache., which makes it painful to watch her.\n\nBoth actresses suffer from the fact that, contrary to the strict way of doing the Poirot series, much tampering with the original stories has been done for most episodes. That did not much good to the plausability of the plots.",
