Indian movies carry the stigma of all being the same and that is pretty much true, but this movie is one that you have to see and i guarantee that you will love it as much as i did.\n\nThe plot is basic, the love triangle and the quest for your soulmate. the acting is decent and the beautiful male specimen that Arjun Rampal is adds a definite sparkle!!! The soundtrack is excellent as well, so all in all, this is a must see for any indian movie buff.",
