Tevya was a enlightened old man, he had open-minded thought and he deeply loved his three daughters. When he looked into the future of the daughters who were unmarried, he always sang the song \"If I am the rich\" very kindly, because he fervently expected that they got a bright future.\n\nIn the beginning, Tevya was trying to marry off Tzietel, the oldest daughter. The matchmaker found her a matcher in Lazar Wolfm the butcher. However, the butcher was much older than Tzietel, and she didn't love him. she loved a poor tailor, and they promised to each other that they would get married. At last Tevya said yes to them. Meanwhile the second child Hodel, and a poor student also fell in love soon, and they got engaged. They informed her father this and he gave them permission to be married. The poor student was arrested for demonstrating, and was sent to a distant prison, Hodel left to join there. Last, the last daughter , Chava and Fyedka fell in love. Chava told Tevya, and he was outraged, because she wanted to marry out of the faith. She got married anyway, and Tevya disowned her. Soon after that, all of the Jewish people in Anatevka got a notice to move out. And that's the end of the play. Ir's a kind of sad ending."
