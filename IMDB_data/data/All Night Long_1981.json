        "reviewBody": "This is not a typical Streisand film for Streisand fans!!/ This is a very good comedy drama about mid life crisis. Gene Hackman is the guy in this quandry...He wants to hold onto to his fast fading youth change his career, his marital situation etc... problems with his nagging wife, Diane Ladd, and his difficult son, Dennis Quaid, leads him to the arms of Cheryl , BLONDE SEXY CHERYL, PORTRAYED BEAUTIFULLY BY STREISAND !!. Not Fanny Brice, or Dolly Levi, or even Katie.. this is a different totally different Streisand in a beautiful subtle comic performance...She's like a subdued Marilyn Monroe, and plays the part so well you totally forget its Bab! Thats acting world, and she should have been praised ,not panned for this performance !! Hackman is excellent, & the entire cast plays their roles well. Not a great movie, but certainly not the disaster most critics declared it to be.. nice enjoyable adult comedy, with a an interesting slant on a mid life crisis.Deserves to be seen !! When I saw this film opening day in NJ,,there were about 15 people in theatre... critics had already killed it, unfairly... go see for yourself!!",
