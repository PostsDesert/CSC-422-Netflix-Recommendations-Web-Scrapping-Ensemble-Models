Like the original Pied Piper, Snoopy would be awarded handsomely with a year supply of dog food, and the mean old mayor refuses to award Snoopy, who of course, gets his revenge! :)\n\nMe, being a HUGE \"Peanuts\" fan, could NOT miss out on all the fun! Also, it's more up to date than the old classics in which I too keep close to my childhood memories. i.e.: Snoopy talks on a cell phone and this episode actually features adults who actually speak without the famous \"wa wan wa\" languages! *lol*\n\nA fun class for all Snoopy and Charlie Brown fanatics, young and old! :)",
