        "reviewBody": "I've seen a few episodes of this anime series. The episodes I saw were subbed and like it always happens with anime they are much better then the dubbed version. The series is about a guy named Kain Blueriver, who always wears a cape and is very good with his psi blade that looks a lot like a light-saber, his green-haired partner Canal which is a holographic representation of a their spaceship Swordbreaker's computer (she gets very touchy when somebody points out that she's a computer). There's also a girl named Millie, who is a terrible cook and always has explosions in the kitchen. She also has a dream of becoming \"the best in the universe\". She's a pretty good shot, though. Together they take on all kinds of weird assignments and travel to distant planets. They are usually pretty desperate since they are often short on money. If this sounds a lot like Cowboy Bebop to you, than you are wrong. Cowboy Bebop this ain't. It's much more light hearted anime series with a lot of comedic elements in it. Anyway, it's a fun if somewhat inconsistent anime series. Episode #8 is especially funny. The visuals are pretty decent for a TV series just don't expect OAV quality visuals. The music is pretty good too. If you're looking for a fun anime series with some action/adventure elements in it I suggest you give this one a try.",
