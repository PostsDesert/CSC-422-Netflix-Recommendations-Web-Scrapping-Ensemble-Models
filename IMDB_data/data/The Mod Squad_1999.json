        "reviewBody": "The Mod Squad\n\nThe worst part about employing young undercover cops is they binge drink at house parties and break cover.\n\nThankfully, the covert trio in this action movie are too busy tracking a killer to attend ragers.\n\nOpting to work for the police in a new department instead of serving time, Julie (Claire Danes), Pete (Giovanni Ribisi) and Linc (Omar Epps) are trained in the art of infiltration by their mentor Capt. Greer (Dennis Farina).\n\nBut when Greer ends up on the wrong side of a drug lord's gun, the motley crew must bring his killer to justice.\n\nA slapdash adaptation of the groundbreaking counterculture cop drama from the '60s, this 1999 version lacks the social and political undercurrent of its source material. \n\nInstead, it's a lifeless and shoddily acted knock-off - similar to the original in name only.\n\nBesides, immature undercover officers today can't stop posting on Twitter about being undercover. \n\nRed Light\n\nvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",
