I like it. \"Black Dog\" is a silly trucker action/thriller topped off with comedy, both intentional and unintentional, and a really, really cool country music score. The reason why so many people don't like it is simply 'cause they are taking it far too seriously. If you're like me and have had plenty of warning NOT to take \"Black Dog\" so seriously (thanks to the other IMDb members), then you'll like \"Black Dog\". \n\nIn short, DO NOT expect \"Black Dog\" to be something like \"Donnie Darko\" and/or \"Fight Club\". Don't take it seriously and you may just have a rollicking good time, especially if you are a fan of anyone who stars in it.",
