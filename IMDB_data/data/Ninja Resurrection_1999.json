        "reviewBody": "It seems that you will either hate this show or love it. The people that hate it seem to be people that are big anime fans to begin with and the people that like it seem to like only a few anime. One of my big problems with it, is that it only last two episodes, and it's clear that the story was suppose to be longer, because the show ends with no real ending. It only has two episodes, the first starts of goofy, with a Christian theme that makes you think you watching some bad Christian program for kids. By the end of the first show there is so much ultra violence and blood that you start to wonder if your watching to different shows. The second episode is pretty much just more ultra violence with some character development.\n\nAlso, one of the reasons that this show is so hated, is that it uses that same person that the \"Ninja Scroll\" main character was based on, who was a real historical samurai. Although neither film is realistic, it's kind of like give George Washington a motorcycle and machine gun, then having him fight zombies. Of course \"Ninja Scroll\" is a thousands times better then this show, but don't let that worry you, this show is still enjoyable.",
