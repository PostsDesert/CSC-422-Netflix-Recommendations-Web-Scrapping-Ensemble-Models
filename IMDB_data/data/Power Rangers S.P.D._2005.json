Actually I am a bit guilty of this as well since the newest series \"Mysitc Force\" doesn't float my boat like SPD. Disney now has Power Rangers Generations, and I cringe every time I watch an old show. I have even remarked to my husband that Power Rangers have come a long way.\n\nMy son absolutely loves the show. We watched one of the final episodes this morning. It definitely created some tension with the evil forces taking over headquarters, and the A squad defecting to the dark side. I am hoping that a sixth DVD comes out with all of the SWAT mode episodes!"
