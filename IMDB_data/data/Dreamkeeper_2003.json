While traveling, Grandpa tells mysterious Indian tales of love, friendship and magic and brings his grandson back to the Indian traditions and culture.\n\nWhat a great surprise was watching \"Dreamkeeper\"! Released on VHS in Brazil, with 167 minutes running time, it is composed by several wonderful mystical Indian tales, with gods, spirits, enchanted horse, evil serpent in a lake, all of them connected through the narrative of the Grandpa to his grandson and with the support of excellent cast and special effects. This feel-good film is a must-see entertainment for the whole family. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Guardi√£o dos Sonhos\" (\"Dreamkeeeper\")\n\nNote: On 03 May 2014, I saw this movie again on DVD.\n\nNote: On 02 Oct 2021, I saw this movie again.",
