This film is badly acted, and it didn't help that a lot of the movie is in garbled English either. It's very hard to tell why it was nominated for best film editing as that's one of the other aspects of the movie that I didn't like. I was let down by this one \n\nDVD Extras: Three making-of featurettes; music video; Star bios; Theatrical Trailer; Trailers for \"Extreme Crises\", \"Enter the Eagles\", and \"A Hero Never Dies\" (all 3 of which are better than this) \n\nMy Grade: D",
