        "reviewBody": "I'll be honest, when I picked up \"Deceived\", I was less than looking forward to viewing it. Given Cloud Ten's horrible and unbearable movie record, it's still a mystery why I picked it up. But since I was out of movies to watch for the night, I popped it in.\n\nSURPRISE!!!\n\nThis has to be Cloud Ten's best movie to date. After seeing all of the others (Revelation, Tribulation, Judgment, Left Behind, ect.) I was surprised to find out that Cloud Ten is learning the meaning of the word, \"Quality\". The script wasn't that bad at all; it was not overly preachy. There were some awkward dialogue, but it was a LOT less than all the other movies. As far as casting goes, again lot's of improvement from previous films. I think that casting Judd Nelson was a good decision as well as that of Gossit. It was well photographed, the sound mix was decent and the score actually fit.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 7 out of 10. It's not totally perfect (Title Sequence) , but it's getting there. Regardless of what others might think, \"Deceived\", has quality behind it that ALL the other Cloud Ten movies could only long for. If Cloud Ten continues on this path, they may just win me back."
