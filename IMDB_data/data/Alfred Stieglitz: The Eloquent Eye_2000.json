        "reviewBody": "Solid, well made biography of master photographer Alfred Stieglitz. \n\nI always admired Stieglitz's photography. What's fascinating, and new to me is what a huge influence Stieglitz had over early 20th century modern art in America. His influence went well beyond photography, and well beyond his own work. \n\nOpening and operating his own gallery for years, he brought attention to the cutting edge of American and European artists. (He gave Picasso his first solo show in the U.S.) We also get glimpses into his marriage to the great Georgia O'Keefe. \n\nWhile not the most emotional of documentaries, with a slight tendency to repeat itself, this is still a deserving and intelligent work, shedding light on a key moment in the development of modern art and culture.",
