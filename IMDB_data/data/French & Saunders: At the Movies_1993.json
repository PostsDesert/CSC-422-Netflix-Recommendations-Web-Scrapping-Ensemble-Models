        "reviewBody": "A Francophile will probably like this film. I did. Meg Ryan plays a woman who's on the verge of marrying a Canadian, so she's denounced her American citizenship. She's also afraid of flying so she stays home while her fiance goes to Paris on business. Things take a turn for the worse when he calls, saying he's met the woman of his dreams and he's staying in France.\n\nFrantic to get back her man, she boards a plane. Next to her sits a French thief, beautifully played by Kevin Kline, who has problems of his own, most notably how to smuggle a diamond necklace out of the country.\n\nIt's a character-driven plot that Cary Grant would have loved - two people who are seemingly so \"repelled\" by each other but all they need are the right elements to fall in love. I'm generally not a fan of the romantic-comedy, but the French setting sucked me in as did a supporting role played by the always excellent Jean Reno. \n\nAs for the authenticity of Kline's accent, I had a good friend from France who claimed it was \"formidable.\" So there.\n\nVery entertaining and worth a watch.\n\nWant more French choices? Try \"Frantic\" with Harrison Ford, it's Hitchcockian; \"Green Card,\" who can resist Depardieu?; and my all-time favorite Meg Ryan film \"Addicted to Love.\" It's a great black comedy and it has the sizzlingly sexy Tcheky Karyo. \"C'est magnifique!\"",
