        "reviewBody": "This film pre-dates & set the standard for films like Barbra Streisand's \"Funny Girl\" & Diana Ross' \"Lady Sings The Blues\", two other great films which showcased singers in acting roles playing real-life people. \"Love Me Or Leave Me\" was Doris Day's MGM \"extravagaza\" (after several formula, cookie-cutter musicals at Warner Bros.) playing Ruth Etting a torch singer from the 1920's. She is at her dramatic best & never looked sexier. Her voice is as pleasing as ever & the songs are very enjoyable (\"At Sundown\", \"Love Me Or Leave Me\", \"Shaking The Blues Away\", & \"Mean To Me\", among others). Some of Doris' fans were distraught to see her drinking & scheming to climb her way to the top, but the fact of the matter is she was playing someone else & she was very convincing. James Cagney was grating as Marty \"The Gimp\" Snyder the Chicago gangster who helped Etting attain her show biz goals. This film displays all that Doris Day could have been if she had continued to find meaty roles to her acting advantage. When most people think of her, they think of the fluffy bedroom comedies she did with Rock Hudson, Cary Grant & James Garner.(\"Pillow Talk\", \"Lover Come Back\", \"That Touch of Mink\"...), the virginal persona, the freckles, etc. If you're only familiar with those films you should see this & you'll be impressed. (I recently heard Jennifer Lopez wants to re-make this film, God help us all!!)",
