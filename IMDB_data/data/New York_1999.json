There were familiar stories being told about the first settlers on the southern tip of Manhattan to the magnificent art deco era skyscrapers. But there was so much information, so many historical stories and significances that I had not known about until I watched this. It gives one (especially New Yorkers) a finer understanding of New York.\n\nTrue, the series is rather long (FIVE TAPES NO LESS!) but it grasped me so much that I couldn't stop watching. It has the interesting stories accompanied by excellent narratives by anyone and everyone, and fine archival photos and film. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to know how this city came to be. I think it would be especially of interest for historians, architects, and urban environment scholars."
