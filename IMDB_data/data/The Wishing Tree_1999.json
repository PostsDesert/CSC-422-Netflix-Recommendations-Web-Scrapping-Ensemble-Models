        "reviewBody": "The Wishing Tree (1977) is a good movie, sort of a poetic parable with no plot but takes a big dark shift at the end. Showing a realistic display of Georgia before the revolution like a solemn and reflective piece of poetry. The ending is just sorrowful, and the course of events are drawing the attention of viewers easily and it is not easy to forget the scenes from the movie after watching it. The first image of a dying horse in a poppy field sets the tone and becomes a potent metaphor for the film in miniature. Most of the film takes place in a wilderness area cordoned off by the city and revolves around the orphaned girl Marita who has done a fabulous job. This film is so deeply immersive, taking its time to give us an incredibly realistic portrayal of what life was like in pre-revolutionary community. The first hour or so is slow, but it establishes the world these people were living in when societal norms, superstition, ignorance, and religion were so dominant. There are lots of little touches in the film, such as the villager's reaction to the events. Though it is based on 22 stories by Georgian poet and prose writer Giorgi Leonidze, the film is less concerned with the full detail than it is with pondering the philosophical and societal notions of personal faith, innocence, gender imbalance, guilt and desire. The performances are solid, the most vivid coming in the part of Lika Kavzharadze, the innocent Marita. This is part of Tenghiz Abuladze's cinematic triptych: \"The Supplication\" - \"The Wishing Tree\" - \"Repentance\". Highly recommended!!",
