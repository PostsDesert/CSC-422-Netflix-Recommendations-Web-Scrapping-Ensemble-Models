Qi Shu was just so superb doing this film.\n\nThe story was a little bit hard for me to understand because there was some things that they talked about that I didn't get, but you'll probably understand later on in the ending.\n\nThat Qi Shu is so cool, that he should be like the next Jet Li. I really enjoyed this movie, and I hope that I can get it. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves action.",
