I rented it as part of a bad horror movie marathon, along with Leprechaun in Space. It has some of the funniest moments I've ever seen in any movie. The running joke about the film's low budget was one. Also, the fight in the bar made me laugh hysterically. Why did the fight occur? I have no idea! Keep in mind that I don't enjoy this movie on a campy, b-movies-are-cool level. I regard this movie on a One of the Funniest Movies Ever Made level. George Clooney has large hair and does a pretty good job. Also, look out for Rick Rockwell, TV's Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire? millionaire in one of his rare movie appearances! He plays a shady villain.",
