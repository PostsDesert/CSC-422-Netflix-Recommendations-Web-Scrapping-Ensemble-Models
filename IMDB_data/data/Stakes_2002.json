I lost tract of the body count.\n\nYes, as others have mentioned, there is a sex/nude scene which doesn't make much sense within the context of the movie. That's a minor problem.\n\nThis is one film you can sit and enjoy - and mock - with impunity. And, thankfully, has a running time of about 83 minutes. \n\nNow, I just wish I could create a stake deadly enough to stick into the heart of this movie.\n\nI'm giving it a 3 out of 10, which may be more than it really deserves but the CGI is pretty good throughout, so there's that.",
