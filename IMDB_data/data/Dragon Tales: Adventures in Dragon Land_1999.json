        "reviewBody": "I grew up on the original Sesame Street back in the 1970s. It's a real shame to see how far the series has fallen from it's glory days, therefore I was very skeptical when I heard that the Children's Television Workshop was working on a new series. I figured it would be as poor as the Sesame Street has been for the last 15 years. I couldn't have been more wrong, Dragon Tales is an absolutely charming series that little ones and even their parents will enjoy greatly. Dragon Tales is filled to the bursting point with cute (yet in no way obnoxious) characters and lots of singing and dancing. I have to make a confession, I often times whistle the \"Bet You Can\" song when I mow the lawn!\n\nFans of the classic CGI series \"Reboot,\" will get a kick out of hearing some very familiar voices. Kathleen Barr is on hand (I'm sure she sings some of the songs), as is Andrea Libman. But the most familiar voice is that of Shirley Millner, Hexadecimal herself as Doctor Boo Boo Gone. It's amazing to hear the same voice of crazy Hex coming out the mouth of the kindly old Doctor. She truly is a talented voice actress.\n\nDragon Tales proves that there may yet be hope for quality children's programming on television."
