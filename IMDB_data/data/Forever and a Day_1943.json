The film is well photographed and obviously has a good budget but fails to really engage. Nigel Bruce is billed 64th (!) as Major Garrow, though it must be said, billing is in order of appearance. That said, Bruce, like a lot of the stars, has very little to do but what he does is effective and shows how expert he was on screen at this stage of his career.",
