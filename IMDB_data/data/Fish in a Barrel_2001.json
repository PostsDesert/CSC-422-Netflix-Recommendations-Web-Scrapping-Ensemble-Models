I think it was about 9 days because the person who I was downloading it from was away for awhile and I didn't think I would be able to get it for my daughter who absolutely adores Jeremy Renner. I wanted to present it to her for Christmas and was unable to get it any other way. After capturing it and watching it, I was so happy. My 31 yr old son, myself and my twins daughters, Sam and Rachel loved the movie. It has an Indy feel and is funny, sad and even annoying at times. I love this movie and am hoping to buy the actual DVD somewhere, if I can find it. It wasn't even released in Canada, or so I heard. :( Anyhow, I would recommend anyone to watch this film, 'cause it's great!\n\nDeb",
