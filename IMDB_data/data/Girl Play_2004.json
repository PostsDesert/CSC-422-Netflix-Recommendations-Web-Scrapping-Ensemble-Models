It has everything and then some. Lacie Harmon and Robin Greenspan wrote the movie and also play themselves. What charmers. We saw it at the Festival in DC and intend to see it again when it comes to NYC. There was mention of a sequel when the writers were questioned in DC. I hope this is so. If they ever sell the DVD rights, this will be added to our permanent library. I don't understand why it has such a low rating on this website. It would seem that someone is just being vindictive. What a shame to ridicule such a wonderful film.",
