        "reviewBody": "Great movie! one of my favorites. All may not like it but for a regional boy this is exactly what western pa is. Small steel towns that have nothing left except their sporting pride. Kids wanting to escape and western Pa's beloved football is the only way out for many. These are the Western Pa. Archeotypes : Some kids love it but feel they can't make it any other way. Salvuchi\n\nSome kids have the talent but need that extra exposure. But it all depends on how individuals in power like you. Stef\n\nKids with enough talent to get out of the town without added exposure. the receiver who went to West Virginia\n\nThe coach who thinks he is God of town if he has some success. Nelson\n\nthe disgruntled band student,\"why do they get athletes deserve scholarship attitudes\" Lea.\n\nThe movie nailed the sights and sounds. It showed how whole towns close on friday nights. The football scenes were great! Even besides the football it showed the tough steelman, the guys in towm that slave all day and go to the watering hole right after work before going home for the evening. It showed how serious we Western Pa's take our local sports, We really would trash a coaches yard and fight seventeen year olds if we think they cost the game. Gritty reality to small town life. An under appreciated film that captures a regions attitude and feel in our great Nation! Ampipe is Aliquippa,Duquesne, Johnstown, beaver falls clairton, McKeesport,monesson and the rest of the Mon and beaver Valleys that were created by the US Steel, J&L and Bethleham steel"
