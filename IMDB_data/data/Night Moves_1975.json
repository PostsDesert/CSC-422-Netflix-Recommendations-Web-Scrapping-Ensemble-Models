        "reviewBody": "Night Moves is not a bad film. It's actually quite good. It is also off-beat and a just a little bit odd but not quirky. \n\nIt is not hard to figure out why a young girl has run away from home when we see her mother, a washed up, alcoholic living in the Hollywood Hills. What is odd is trying to figure out the relationship between her, her stepfather and his girlfriend in the Florida Keys where she has gone to live. It is hinted that the stepfather is not just a stepfather. \n\nEven stranger is Jennifer Warren's odd, abrupt, salty behavior in the film and the the strange dialog written for her. At one point, Gene Hackman even tells her he is tired of her \"ping-pong talk\". Was that written for the benefit of the audience or did he improvise? I felt puzzled by much of her performance.\n\nIt is also painful, really painful to watch Gene Hackman's wife struggle with their relationship and her learning new things about her husband. \n\nYes, a strange, strange little film. The acting is almost too revealing. I can't quite wrap my brain around the whole thing. I think it will be appreciated by fans of films from the 70's.",
