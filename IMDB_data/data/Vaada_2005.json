Putting that aside, this was not a bad thriller; unusually for a Bollywood film, I found myself switching allegiances between the two main actors, even feeling pity for the psychotic. With a better script (or better subtitling, perhaps?), removal of the unnecessary dances, and a tenser courtroom scene, this film could have been very good. For me, the best performance was put in by Zayed Khan, I won't say more for fear of giving too much away. I saw this film on a long plane flight, and it entertained me perfectly well.",
