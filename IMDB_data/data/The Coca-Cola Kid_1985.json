        "reviewBody": "This is one of the most fantastic movies ever made. \n\nI'm not kidding. \n\nEssentially the movie is about corporate America vs. Australia. More broadly, the film is about American corporate imperialism and a country's attempt to resist it.\n\nEric Roberts plays the gung-ho American coca-cola executive (\"the marines have landed on every continent except Australia.. AND HERE I AM!\"), intent on establishing a coca-cola franchise in the heart of Australia. The stubbornly independent Australians resist the American businessman with their own brand of humour and subversiveness.\n\nWatch for several layers of meaning throughout the film. Especially the \"Waltzing Matilda\" scene.\n\nNotable quote: \"We have bottling franchises in every country on the planet. Including the moon.\"\n\nA brilliant movie that will change your life.. or a movie that you'll ignore."
