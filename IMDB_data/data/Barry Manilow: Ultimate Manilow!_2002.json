It was a lot of fun and Barry sang all of his major hits (Unlike when I saw him in concert and he didn't sing \"Looks Like We Made It\" or \"Can't Smile Without You.\") \"Looks Like We Made It\" is very well done here as a medly with \"Send in the Clowns.\" \"Could it be Magic\" is a lot of fun in the disco version, then beautifully sung as a medly with \"Mandy.\" My only complaint would be that I wanted more of \"The Copacabana.\" This is a must see for any Barry fan!",
