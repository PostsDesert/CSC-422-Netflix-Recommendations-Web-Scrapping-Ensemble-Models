        "reviewBody": "I watched this after seeing both previous movies (Ginger Snaps and Ginger Snaps- The Sequel) so I knew what to expect. You have to realise that even though this film has werewolves in it, its main theme is unbreakable sisterly loyalty. I have to say that I'm a fan so a bit biased, but as in the previous films the best thing in this one is the atmosphere- menacing and charged and the setting (dark winter woods) is just perfect! Another thing that made me come back is the two main characters. They are played with so much conviction that you really believe they could overcome anything as long as they trust each other enough. The only problem was the werewolf story itself- just a bit too predictable. Other than that I was entertained throughout and I will watch this film again!",
