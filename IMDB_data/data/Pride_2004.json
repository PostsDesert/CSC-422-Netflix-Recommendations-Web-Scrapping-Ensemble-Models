        "reviewBody": "I remember this first coming on the television when I was 8 years old and it being one of my absolute favourites. My grandad who loves anything to do with animals also enjoyed it just as much, if not more than I did! His favourite part being the bit with the ear joke. \"Ear today gone tomorrow what?!\" Whenever I hear that line, I just get an image of him laughing in my head, so this film also triggers happy memories for me!\n\n A lot of films where animals have a human talking as them don't always work but this does, the script brings personality to the characters and is believable.\n\n Another thing is that I don't think this film can only be enjoyed by the young, it can be enjoyed by the young and the young at heart older people. I'm now 23 and I watched it again today and absolutely loved it, again.\n\n Please watch this with your children. A decent(ish) version of it can be found on putlockers website.",
