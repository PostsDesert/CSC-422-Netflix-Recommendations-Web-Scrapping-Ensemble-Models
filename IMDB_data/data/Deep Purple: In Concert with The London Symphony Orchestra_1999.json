        "reviewBody": "I just saw this for the first time and was just blown away! This is a seamless blend of classical and rock music by the band that invented the genre. The orchestral portions of this concert were originally from DP's 1969 album, Concerto for Group and Orchestra. The original score was lost, and years later rewritten by Jon Lord and a Dutch fan who was a musical historian. We are lucky to be able to see this with the new, and re-energized DP lineup featuring guitar virtuoso Steve Morse of The Dixie Dregs. If you love DP, or classical music, or just want to see a large group of musicians at the top of their game, you will love this. Please don't listen to small minded wannabe critics who don't have an understanding for musical genius. This DVD is awesome!!!",
