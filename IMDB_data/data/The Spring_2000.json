When this occurs, the locals hold a party and procceds to kill the birthday party guest!The town offers the travelers to stay but they cannot ever leave again!It was OK for the small screen, I just wish they would of had the idea of explaining about the children living there!?Just how are they born and age?Other than that it also asks us about questions about aging and playing god with people's lives!!?The cast was decent, but I wish Alison Eastwood(clint's daughter) character was better developed!!"
