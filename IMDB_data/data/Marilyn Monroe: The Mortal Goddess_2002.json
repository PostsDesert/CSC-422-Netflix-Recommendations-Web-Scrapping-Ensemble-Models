From her troubled childhood to sex bombshell superstardom, to her tragic abrupt ending. There's many interviews with people that worked with & knew her including her first husband James Dougherty, Hugh Hefner, Susan Strasburg, Eli Wallach, among others. Listening to them you really feel like you're a step closer knowing what kind of person Norma Jean was behind the screen. A misunderstood woman ahead of her time & didn't get the credit she deserved till after her death. Highly recommend if you're looking for the right documentary.",
