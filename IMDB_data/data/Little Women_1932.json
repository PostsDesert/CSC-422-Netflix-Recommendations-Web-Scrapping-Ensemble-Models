For me, IMHO, she is more entitled to get Oscar Best Director nomination than Todd Philips.\n\nHow she direct the entire cast and crew, a camera movement, a music selection, everything is amazing.\n\nA story plot that uses forward and backward flow (a non-linear plot) packed very cleverly. It also shows how smart the use of transition in a film.",
