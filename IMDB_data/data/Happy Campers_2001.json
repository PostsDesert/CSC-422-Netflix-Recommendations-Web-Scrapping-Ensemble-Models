Brad Renfro was great and even if his career has been reduced to guest spots in Ghost World, I still think he has talent. There was a \"be yourself\" message, but it was twisted rather than sparkling clean. I liked that. I liked the film (don't tell anyone). I just wish the writer hadn't tried so hard to make Midsummer's Night Dream references. A good teen movie is frivilous and meaningful and this was both."
