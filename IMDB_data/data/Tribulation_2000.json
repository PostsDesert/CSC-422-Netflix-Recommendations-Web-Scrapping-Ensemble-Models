I saw this movie years ago and recently watched it again and the same thing impresses me-- Gary Busey's performance as Tom Canboro. There is one line he says, with a gun in his face: \"If you came to change my mind, you're too late\" and he smiles in this amazing way. If you like character-driven stories (rather than pretty faces and special effects) you will enjoy this film. \n\nTeens I watched the film with really responded to Nick Mancuso as the Antichrist, found him very creepy! It's good casting all around, actually; yet the message is not overshadowed by star-power (kudos to Busey for that).\n\nThis is a Christian film with a Christian message, delivered without a heavy hand; and the main character's spiritual process is 100% believable.",
