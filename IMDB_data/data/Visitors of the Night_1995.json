This movie started out good creepy but and I kept watching it even thought I shouldn't have...it got worse and worse as the daughter got probed by aliens. I can't totally blame this movie for my now sleep nightmare problems, since it was my choice to watch this TV movie, but I now yell in my sleep and had night terrors after seeing this movie. Will never watch this again. I don't recommend it to those who get scared by aliens as it was graphic or don't like sci-fi. This movie will never be in my household. I can't believe there is a TV movie that is as visual as this one!",
