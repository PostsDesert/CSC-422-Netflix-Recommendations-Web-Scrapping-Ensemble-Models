        "reviewBody": "I know that Who's The Boss? is a fondly remembered show of the 80s, yet I don't think it ever got the credit it deserved. Although it blends in as a sitcom just like the many others of its decade, I believe it stands alone in other ways. The cast is highly talented and the chemistry was amazing. Especially between Tony Danza and Judith Light's characters. No one can beat the quick wit of Katherine Helmond's Mona, and it takes a heck of a good actress to make the character what it was. The sexual tension between Angela and Tony is what everyone seems to remember when they discuss this show, and the writers kept it going for seven years before the characters finally confessed their love. I think this long running courtship makes the show stand out because it was done so well and so believably when in reality the concept is quite farfetched. Throw in a couple of cute and funny kids who developed into great actors themselves, and I think you have one of the BEST sitcoms of the 80s. Long live the reruns in cable!"
