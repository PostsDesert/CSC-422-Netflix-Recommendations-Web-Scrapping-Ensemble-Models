        "reviewBody": "This is truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I've sat through some real stinkers. \"The Last Sign\" features a deadly combination of wooden acting from Andie MacDowell, overacting on the son's part that soap operas would balk on, and a script that sounds as though it was written by a three-year-old. Consider this line uttered by Mark (Samuel Lebihan) at a baseball game. \"Frank's team is winning. Now all the pressure is on Frank.\" This was followed by shouts to Frank of \"Come on! You can do it!\" It might look nice on paper, but it sounded so wooden and unrealistic coming out of their mouths that as soon as the movie was over, I wanted to throw the DVD across the room. Let's not forget the fact that too many unbelievable events happened for no reason, and the ending completely forgot to explain them all. Avoid this movie like the plague.",
