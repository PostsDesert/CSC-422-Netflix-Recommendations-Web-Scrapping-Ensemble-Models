The show was I believe on Saturday mornings and was easily one of the best shows Fox had on at the time. While Ian Bohen had played Hercules in the YOUNG HERCULES movie and some of the \"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys\" episodes, he was replaced here with Ryan Gosling who did an impressive job with the role. Also good with their roles was Chris Conrad as Jason, Kevin Smith as Ares, and Dean O'Gorman as Iolaus. In addition to the rather good acting, the directing and writing were also surprisingly well done. It would have been cool to have executive producer Sam Raimi direct an episode, but that never happened. Perhaps if he had been more involved in the show, it would have become more popular and might not have been canceled."
