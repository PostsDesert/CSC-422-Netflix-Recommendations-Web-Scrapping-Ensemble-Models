        "reviewBody": "Here it is, forty years later, and I could talk about Disney's minor effort in The Ugly Dachshund, a bland little quickie of a family movie that features not a single fresh idea or character. It does have cute dachshunds (which I appreciate) and a great dane (two votes from my wife and daughter; no taste there!), Dean Jones, Suzanne Pleshette, and Charlie Ruggles.\n\nThe story is unimportant and, unfortunately, is not very well pieced together; usually live-action features from Disney in the 60's and 70's were pretty tightly plotted. The movie just has one opportunity after another for the dogs to destroy the best efforts of humans. It's all so dumb and gentle and uninvolved that you'll want to slap a blue ribbon for mediocrity on the side of your TV--Blandest in Show! \n\nBut who cares, anyway? It has Suzanne Pleshette. I watched the whole movie and griped about the dozen minutes or so lopped off by Hallmark for a two hour time slot. That meant there was footage of Pleshette missing! Throughout the movie, she appears in one lovely outfit after another, looking like a gift from Heaven (and she falls on a Japanese fellow at one point--he's laying on his back after collapsing from his fear of the great dane--and she's got these tight pants on and . . . ).\n\nWooeee . . . was I gone long? \n\nJust leave it to me to smut up a review of a Disney movie! \n\nBy the way, when Pleshette falls on the Japanese guy, he has this little grin on his face that made me think he went to the director and told him to forget paying him for the day--it was all worth it."
