This is an amazing, over-the-top performance, and belongs in any true metalheads collection. \n\nCompare the intensity and drive and precision these guys exhibit to the lame crap that passes for 99% of all other bands output, and then remember that when they recorded this, they were all over 40 years old and had been playing together for more than 20 years. Then remember how other so-called thrash/metal bands slowed down and began cranking out ballads and pop $417.\n\nStill loud, fast, and angry... just the way it should be!",
