        "reviewBody": "For all of us,when we think about ww1,we imagine everything in black and white.This excellent documentary change this for good. The picture is not perfect,but is very good. The narrator(Kenneth Branagh)is excellent,and the music is epic.Actually the narrator is one of the best i have ever heard in a war documentary,along with Sir Michael Redgrave and Sir Laurence Olivier. Now on the actual content,the details about the battles,the weapons and the statistics,the colored footage and the interviews from the veterans,all combined together in every chapter works fine.As a matter of fact everyone wants to see Red Byron's plane flying as it really was.Red. Too bad that the veterans are only British,i would also like to see and hear an interview from the other side,but that's OK.Also there are not so many details about the politics or a prologue chapter about the era before the war,but you can see queen Victoria in the late 90s for example,and hear some information about politics of that time. Great job,this is one of the best docs about ww1",
