        "reviewBody": "A group of young adults decides to stay in a bed and breakfast for the night, but by morning two people are dead. Now witnesses and possibly suspects, the sheriff keeps them in town... but that's not the best idea, since there's about to be an outbreak of zombies, and not many will survive the next few days.\n\nMaybe you stumbled on this film because you like horror comedies. And if you did, that was a good idea. It's funny and has gore that may remind you of such low budget classics as the early works of Peter Jackson (\"Bad Taste\" and \"Dead Alive\"). Nice blood, decapitated heads, a chainsaw and a homemade shotgun.\n\nMaybe you stumbled on this because of the cameos from Diedrich Bader and David Carradine, or the appearance of horror regular Jeremy Sisto. Bader and Carradine are both great, though their parts are small. Sisto is also his typical self, which means you'll probably enjoy him. He's not as prominent as he is in other films (such as \"May\"), but he does not disappoint.\n\nThe reason you should have watched this film, but you probably didn't, is for Zach Selwyn (also known as simply Zachariah). He plays Randall Keith Randall, the musical gas station attendant. His songs are great, particularly one where he mixes rap and country, and has zombies dancing the \"Thriller\" dance. (Outside of this film, he is marginally known for his songs \"CILF\" and \"TSA Gangstaz\"... YouTube them.) The film would have been great without him, but he brought the enjoyment over the top.\n\nI had known of this film's existence for years, but never had it forced on me until now... I'm glad it was. The picture's a little grainy and the budget is clearly nothing special, but if you're the type of horror fan who can look past that... you'll love it. The only problem is that Billy Burke (Charlie Swan from \"Twilight\") dropped out and doesn't appear... but you wouldn't notice.",
