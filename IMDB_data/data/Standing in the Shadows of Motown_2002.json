        "reviewBody": "\"Standing In The Shadows Of Motown\" is a wonderful insight into the sessions musicians who played on practically every track that Motown Records produced between 1959-1972. Known as \"The Funk Brothers\", these talented men helped craft a sound that became distinctive around the world. They were, the musical backbone of the legendary record label.\n\nDirected by Paul Justman, this documentary highlights the trials and tribulations of \"The Funk Brothers\". With interviews from the surviving members, and concert footage of classic songs from many of today's artists such as Joan Osbourne, Ben Harper, Me'Shell Ndegeocello and several others, this is an entertaining and thoughtful look at the accomplishments these men have made to contemporary American music and the imprint they have left behind.\n\nFascinating, touching, amusing and at times tragic, this documentary is well worth checking out. For lovers of music and for those who enjoyed a good solid documentary, \"Standing In The Shadows Of Motown\" delivers the goods on both counts. See how things were done - Old school style....."
