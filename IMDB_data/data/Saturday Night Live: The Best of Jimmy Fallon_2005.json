        "reviewBody": "I waited 7 suspenseful weeks for this DVD to arrive on my shores, and I can honestly say it was worth every minute! I haven't seen much of SNL so I have nothing to compare this 'Best of' with, but I know Jimmy deserves it. All the skits on this DVD are gold (except for The Leatherman because it features Britney Spears). My favourites are Weekend Update, The Barry Gibb Show, Z105, Cork Soakers and Jimmy's audition for SNL, which is included in the 'extras'. I felt like the biggest dork; sitting by myself laughing my head off. Jimmy is known for his great impressions - I'd heard his parodies before but this was the first time I'd seen his impressions. They're AMAZING! I bet my bottom dollar if you look away and just listen to his voice or hit the mute button and just watch him you'd swear it's Adam Sandler or Jerry Sienfeld. Jimmy Fallon is awesome. This DVD is on the top of my stack now.",
