        "reviewBody": "King of the Hill is unquestionably different from its rivals in many ways: calmer, more subtle and simple. However, what defines KotH more than anything else is its timelessness: other shows seem to benefit off referencing the news and pop culture (South Park and Family Guy primarily). KotH on the other hand, builds its plot inwards around its own characters and locations. It could be shown to anyone in the next 40 years and they would understand it as much as today. Instead of simply racing towards offending the biggest celebrity or corporation, it keeps conservative and to itself. As well as this, the characters are memorable and brilliantly crafted: Hank, an every day man who sometimes makes stupid decisions. Dale Gribble, an anti-government obsessive. Jeff Boomhauer, the most 'modern' of the 4, but who cant seem to talk properly. And finally Bill Dauterive, a slobby but likable bachelor. The one reason I gave this 8/10 is because sometimes the show doesn't always seem to 'get going' and draw you in to the plot, however this is rare and not something that should put you off the show. To conclude, King of the Hill is a show which never got the attention it deserved, and a great alternative for anyone bored of modern ultra-paced cartoons.",
