It is an hour and a half of excrutiating hell for parents and absolute nirvana for kids who love the card game and the TV show. It is a way to get more kids into the card game and, thus, make more money.\n\nJust remember, adults bring a pillow for a much needed nap (or at least a cell phone with games on it!) and don't buy the kids popcorn and drinks. Mine was too fascinated by the movie to remember to eat the candy (which went straight to my butt) or drink the lemonade (which was thrown out)."
