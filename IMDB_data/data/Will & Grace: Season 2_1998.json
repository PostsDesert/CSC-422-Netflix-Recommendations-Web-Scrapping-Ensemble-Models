The characters are pretty interesting but I'm hoping they prove to be more dynamic as the show progresses. What's weird is that Will Trent is the only character with a Georgian accent. Why are none of the other actors even attempting it? Erika Christensen sounds like a New Yorker, yet their characters supposedly grew up together. Ditto, Paul Camparo, completely accent-less. Also, Trent's dyslexia is so severe, I don't understand how he could possibly get to this point in his career without people noticing. This makes no sense.",
