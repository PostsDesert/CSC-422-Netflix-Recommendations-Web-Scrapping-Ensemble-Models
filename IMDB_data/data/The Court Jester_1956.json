        "reviewBody": "If you're a DANNY KAYE fan, you can't afford to miss this one.\n\nThe highlight for me is the \"vessel with the pestle\" tongue-twisting routine that he carries off to perfection in his own inimitable way. That is, until it switches to \"the flagon with the dragon\", at which point everyone is rightfully confused.\n\nSo much plotting, I won't begin to describe this medieval romp. Just sit back and enjoy while Angela Lansbury (looking very radiant and beautiful) as Gwendolyn, Mildred Natwick as Griselda and Basil Rathbone as Ravenhurst (reprising his role as Sir Guy of Gisbourne in THE ADV. OF ROBIN HOOD) all try to play it straight as Kaye goes into one dizzy sequence after another.\n\nThe technicolor photography is gorgeous to behold, the sets are jaw-droppingly expensive and thoroughly believable, and the lilting songs performed in clever style by Kaye and others more than compensate for any weaknesses. The final duel between Rathbone and Kaye, involving a spell that transforms Kaye into a super-swashbuckler at the snap of a finger, is extremely well staged for both comedy and excitement. Kaye proves his natural athletic grace and ability while Rathbone makes us yearn for the days when he was dueling Errol Flynn at Nottingham castle.\n\nAll in all, a thorough delight from beginning to end. Glynis Johns is charming as Kaye's sweetheart but the real surprise is seeing a youthful Angela Lansbury looking like a storybook heroine with her flowing blond hair and blue eyes radiant in technicolor.\n\nThe whole family should enjoy this one!",
