        "reviewBody": "Sunny deol is fit for the hard man role. He is one of the most convincing performer in Bollywood. His sympathy, leadership, funny and hard attitude are praiseworthy. In Indian he stands as a police commissioner with qualities of both sympathy and hard attitude. Apart from these, Sunny deol always fulfills the patriotic sentiments. He does by truly involving with the dialogue when he says the son will not take permission from the father when he sees his mother being harrased Or every Indian right against defending thier own home against trouble makers.\n\nSunny deol against Danny denzongpa is quite contrasting. An intellectual battle with lot of middle men. The patriotism against the traitors. The battle progresses with a lot of decent confrontation with success and failure on both sides. Finally it ends in the victorious protagonist as a reminder to all traitors and anti national sentiments.\n\nAbout the technical aspects, the storytelling is ambigous and average, the subplots are well crafted satisfying the theme of hidden battle. There is also a funny scene plus the relationship issue among it, which was also well placed into it. The action scenes though are unbelievable, still graps the sunny deol fans. The songs should have been less. The characters are well portrayed. The story seems Sunny deol personal struggle in his family, profession and his duty towards the society. He wins or lose, that doesn't matter. Only matters is that the portrayal of indian attitude. A 60/100.",
