Other performances were pretty excellent too. The music is engaging and well worth adding to any non teenage-dirtbag collection!\n\nThis could easily have been a disaster, but instead turned out to be surprisingly - and pleasantly - good with interesting variations on a theme. Good, clean entertainment that the whole family can enjoy without the usual Hollywood crass to spoilt it! All in all, a big thumbs up to all concerned.",
