One day he noticed a previously assumed catatonic patient actually has reactions. Soon he finds other such patients including Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro), and a drug that could possibly save them.\n\nPenny Marshall created a film that plucks the heartstrings. It is a well crafted emotional tour de force. Robin Williams is able to restraint his manic energy to make Dr Sayer is a compelling man who learns to grow. Robert De Niro is playing the showier part, and he excels at it. The movie will leave you with a tear and a hope in your heart.",
