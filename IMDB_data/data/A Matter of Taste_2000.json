        "reviewBody": "Bernard Rapp's first work is not that much original:a strong Chabrol influence can be felt here there and everywhere.Two movie comes to mind \"les biches\" (1967) and \"Betty\" in the nineties.Both stories concern women,but it does not make a big difference.There's also \"une étrange affaire\" (1981) a Pierre Granier-Deferre effort,in which Michel Piccoli and Gérard Lanvin had a relationship close to that of Rapp's heroes.And let's not forget the classic Losey's \"the servant\" (1963)\n\nThat said,it's a watchable movie though,thanks to Bernard Giraudeau's sensational portrayal;if an actor can redeem a somewhat hackneyed script,this must be Giraudeau:smooth but threatening,affable bon vivant but subtile tyrant,he completely mesmerizes not only his young taster but also the whole audience.He's so powerful that the other actors (including an aging Jean-Pierre Léaud) stay on the bench.I wish he could find a director worth of his exceptional gifts.\n\nThe movie uses flashbacks and its construction recalls \"les aveux de l'innocent\" (1996) ,another offbeat story.The ending is rather unlikely and disappoints a lot.The female part is a cardboard character,and the actress is unable to act as a counterbalance;in \"une étrange affaire\" ,Nathalie Baye made all her scenes count.\n\nSee it anyway!every time Giraudeau is on the screen will make all worthwhile.And try ,if \"une affaire de goût\" is for you an acquired taste,to see the other movies I mention."
