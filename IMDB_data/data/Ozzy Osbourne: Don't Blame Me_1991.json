        "reviewBody": "From the opening scene of seeing Jack, Kelly and the mysterious Aimee Osbourne as they were before the days of *&^%, *%$&%, *&%^%$, this documentary has it all. A true glance at seeing Ozzy, before his shaking and slurring and seeing him tackling personal issues, such as the \"Suicide Solution\" controversy, the death of Randy Rhoads, the biting of the bat, the biting of the dove, p***ing on the Alamo etc... There are a lot of celebrity faces in this show and some great insights given from Alice Cooper, Motley Crue and one or two members of the original Black Sabbath. Also contains rare Sabbath footage (Nativity in Black sung in Paris), a few television appearances... As a real treat, at the end of the documentary, you get to see the long-forgotten music video for \"No More Tears\", a truly amazing video which features a cameo by Kelly Osbourne. So definately check this out! You won't regret it!",
