        "reviewBody": "I admit the first two installments were good and kept your attention. Part three started showing signs of trouble. A female in a all male society club was a bit too much to believe. The story itself was a bit weak and the thought of a female surrounded by males could have gone a bit deeper. One knows off the bat that rape would be expected though not the case here. All those good looking guys not making any moves on her where they'd be protected seemed a bit pointless. This time the movie falls flat and just can't get the momentum going again. The cast is forgettable, the plot is overused and the ideas are all exhausted. By far the weakest in the trilogy and most uninteresting. I wasn't in to this one because they just didn't try to salvage this movie in any way. At least the first two used pride and honor here they just wrote and didn't really do anything with it.",
