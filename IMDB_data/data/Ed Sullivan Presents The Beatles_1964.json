        "reviewBody": "This is an amazing experience; getting a taster of the hysteria and sheer power of a live Beatles performance. The first number 'All my loving' was an historical moment and it appeared so. The audience went bananas and their background screaming was a perfect accompaniment to the music (the DVD gets a good balance; you can hear the music and the audience in the background). Pauls bass is amazing; he plays without looking at the fretboard at any time.\n\nThe first Beatles performance was followed by a magician in a tuxedo doing a card trick. The dead silence which accompanied his act was made only slightly less embarrassing by the fact that it was taped and not live. The Oliver kids and Georgia Brown were good and genuinely appreciated by the audience. \n\nWhat also was fascinating is the effect on the careers of some of the other acts. McCall and Brill had particular cause to be miffed, being slated to appear right before the final Beatle slot. They, in their own words, bombed (I thought they were OK actually, given the circumstances). Anyway they recovered and made solid showbiz careers. They said later that they were in the midst of greatness......\n\nThis is an amazing set and highly recommended.",
