        "reviewBody": "This film is about a young first year Harvard student's life with depression and personality problems.\n\nChristina Ricci's acting is superb in this film. She plays Lizzie very well, she manages to give a full range of emotional expressions. Most of the time, Lizzie's sad, so Christina Ricci had to pull a sad face most of the time. In addition to sadness, there is also joy, ecstasy, intoxication, rage and jealousy. All these emotions are fully and effectively displayed by Ricci.\n\nJessica Lange acts very well in this film as well. She plays this over-controlling mother with a lot of anger. The scene with her arguing about the medical bills with Christina Ricci is amazing, they both displays brilliant acting skills.\n\nThe film is not bad at all, it was a pity that it did not receive a theatrical release."
