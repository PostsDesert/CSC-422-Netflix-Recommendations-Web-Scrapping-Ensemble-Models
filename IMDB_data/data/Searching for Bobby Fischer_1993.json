        "reviewBody": "It's one of the toughest jobs a father faces--how hard should you push to \"make a man\" out of your young son.\n\n\"Searching for Bobby Fischer\" offers a gentle and unexpected answer: You should listen for your son to tell you how \"manly\" he wants to be. Young Max Pomeranc is letter-perfect as the chess prodigy who refuses to become ruthless despite the prodding of his father and his surrogate-father. Joe Mantegna and Ben Kingsley give moving performances as men who can be convincingly converted to the truer, sweeter morality of a young child who doesn't need to be \"tough\" in order to be good. Watch for an understated, underrated performance by Joan Allen as the mom. A beautifully photographed, beautifully paced drama that should reduce anyone with more empathy than a statue to heartfelt tears.",
