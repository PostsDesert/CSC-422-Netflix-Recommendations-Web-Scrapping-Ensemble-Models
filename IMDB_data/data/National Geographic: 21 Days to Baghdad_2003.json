        "reviewBody": "The sorrow that is entered into is that our leadership could do no more than fight the next one that came along.It is something of a personal opinion that any who would of been in this Nations Way post 9/11 would of been dealt with not unlike what was accomplished here.If this was inevitable than so be it, however it has proved something terribly unfair to not be able to establish that there was on center stage any weapon or weapons of mass destruction.The only excuse was that there was some left over mustard gas from an earlier War with Iran and it was this I believe was what there was all the shouting about.It might be further stated that its use then was in-humane and which ultimately Saddam Hussein was found to be held responsible.Some of the rhetoric is likened to a fight that will not be put off and it may very well be that this was going to happen anyway.The inability of coalition forces to finish what it had started with Desert Storm may be one of the unresolved factors that made this all the more likely.The likes of Saddam Hussein and his immediate blood line was of a thug like demeanor which had gained infamy as to its propensity for thug like behavior.To say that this was enough to provide the ground swell needed to attack the Suddam Hussein regime was perhaps a stretch but nonetheless a ground swell.It should be noted that sorrow was entered into when the likes of these various positioned persons do not heed the warnings that often our Holy Bible teaches.God often talks as to the inability of such a privilege not to be fully understood.Even the Great King David brought such sorrow upon his house that humanity may truly know tears and sorrow.I believe had the privilege been truly a privilege the person of Suddam Hussein needed to know better though the rhetoric is a bit undaunted, it is to be understood that Saddam Hussein was a leader of the Nation of Iraq.There is sorrow expressed here for this event.The film perhaps like the 21 days is shortened to not provide as much as would be better to know as well to understand.The likes of War Correspondent Joe Galloway(the same Joe Galloway that reported in the \"We Were Soldiers\" motion picture)provides something of an account however this is a most definite one sided deal.This is further stated there is no doubt here as to the outcome only that it was not only that way,this virtual gloat is damaging to intellect and perhaps mostly a result of a failure of leadership.It was a terrible slight to see the front pages of the American Newspapers with \"The Shock and Awe Campaign\" that such a mean spirit was as if a beligerent had been found and it was The American Press.It was such a spirit that it was as much an opportunity as it was advertising copy,such was this unholy \"Shock and Awe Campaign\".This event may very well be to Madison Avenue underwriters the advertising coop of this nations leaders.It is an intended slight that indeed some may wish not to be associated with,because the lot of humanity is not our property and this is not a game.There is less hope in this world for its fuel seems more from \"Shock and Awe\" than from the floor of the world.This includes this region and others whereby all is a tinderbox for \"Shock And Awe\".The films ability does allow some degree of discernment though this merely is mentioned as targets are hit with precision unlike what war is generally recognized by.This was indeed a very successful exercise in removing Saddam Hussein and his government.It was as well a very effective demonstration of firepower that is unmatched anywhere in the world.The film upon entering a particular area of the interior of Baghdad shows waiting crowds waiving and indeed even Iraq Television and Radio was interviewing the arriving advanced elements of some of our forces.This film was not unlike what was in the news as events unfolded and it was something of what one might expect however it is what it is,a look at the joint effort of both British and American Armed forces to topple Saddam Hussein.",
