If so I am sure it will be a hit. I really enjoyed the two big boy and Bebe drake she is one of my favorite actresses. I think the movie could have had more music the score was fine but the sound track was so good it let me wanting more. Does anyone know where I can get a copy on the music? This movie is definitely a sleeper I am surprised that it wasn't theatrically released. I think there might have been a platform release because I remember seeing the title in the movie theater. This move would have been perfect on the big screen."
