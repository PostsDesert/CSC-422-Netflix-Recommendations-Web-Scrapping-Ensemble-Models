        "reviewBody": "One of the finest German films I've had the pleasure of seeing, 'Comedian Harmonists' tells the true story of a sextet of male singers who form a very famous group in Berlin when Hitler's Socialist party is just starting to get powerful. Of the six, three of them happen to be Jewish, which puts a dampener on their future when it's decreed that only Aryan entertainers will be allowed to perform in Germany. With a love triangle thrown in the mix, as well as the confusion of this almost sudden racial division, the members struggle to really come to terms with their future together. There are some chilling moments involving the hypocritical Nazis, indulging in some ironic entertainment care of the Comedian Harmonists, as well as some great musical segments. With some great performances from the entire cast - the stand outs are Ulrich Noethen as Harry Frommermann and Meret Becker as Erna - the film is a joy to watch, especially the wonderful musical sections, which at first I found to be tedious but then seemed to lift the film. Go figure. Joseph Vilsmaier, director of the excellent 'Stalingrad', has crafted a very entertaining film in this at times funny, joyous and very moving picture. (Watch for the ending - sentimental it may be, but it's very sad, IMO.) Recommended.",
