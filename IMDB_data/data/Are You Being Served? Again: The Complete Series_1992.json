The rest of the cast also grew into their parts from the original. The addition of Fleur and Bennet opened up a whole new set of story side lines.\n\nI thought the writing was superior to the original series. The quality of the production was also superior to the original.\n\nWith the exception of the last two episodes, the scripts were also superior to the original.\n\nEnglish humors sometimes don't do well in this US. But this one made the transition better then most, and even took advantage of some of the differences, IE, Mrs Slocum's cat.\n\nI wouldn't mind seeing more.\n\nIt will often make you smile, and occasionally make you laugh out loud."
