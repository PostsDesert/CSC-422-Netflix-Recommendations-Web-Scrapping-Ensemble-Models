I had heard that it was bad, but I figured, \"reviewers are wrong all the time, and besides I loved Dumb and Dumber.\"\n\nDumb and Dumberer is set back in the 1980's when Harry and Lloyd first meet eachother. Step 1: If your going to make a movie set in the 80's don't be waving around NEW five dollar bills. Step 2: Why ruin the first movie by making a dispicable prequel.\n\nThis movies humor is very much 2nd Grade. If you get a kick at of hearing Bob Saget say SH*T a billion time's then sure go watch this movie. Another that made me mad was how really dumb they were. At least in Dumb and Dumber they had some sense of common sense. In the prequel there is not one inkling of common sense. It almost makes you want to hurt yourself over how dumb they are.\n\nThe only good thing about this movie was Eugene Levy. As always he was histerical. Without him this movie would have been 2 inexperienced actors, literally walking around like a bunch of retards.\n\nBottom line: F+ (with out Eugene Levy) F"
