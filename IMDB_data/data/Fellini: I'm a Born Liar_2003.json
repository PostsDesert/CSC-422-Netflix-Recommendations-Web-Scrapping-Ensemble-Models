        "reviewBody": "What can I say? After the explosion of \"8 1/2\", which knocked me for a loop, I became a devout Fellinian, even though I was dissapointed in other offerings by him (\"City Of Women\", and \"Julett Of The Spirits\"). I will return to them after this film. Along with Welles and Bergman, he completes the \"Holy Trinity\" of filmakers in my life span.. The day before viewing this film, I was depressed by watching an hour of the wretched \"Lost In Translation\" which has received bravos from the major critics, that almost made me question my sanity. I was brought back to reality by many imdb user reviews who agreed with me and were incredulous at the praise of the \"pros\". Fellini sits in a chair and talks quietly of his life's work. He is everything the guys in the professional holy business like priests, bishops, rabbis et al, try to be, and never are... truly loving, kind, gentle, and if he is a phoney, this is one of the greatest cons of all time. One of the funniest parts of the movie is where he had to shoot a scene on the beach showing the ocean. He looked at the sea and said, \"I never liked the way oceans look\", so 200 sq. yards of vinyl became the ocean, and we never knew the differance The wonderful Fellini narration is aided by Donald Sutherland, Terrance Stamp, cameramen, writers, technicians, and of course clips from the films. If you consider yourself a film buff (and a human being) NOT TO BE MISSED!",
