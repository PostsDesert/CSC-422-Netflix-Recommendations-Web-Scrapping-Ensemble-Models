        "reviewBody": "Dragonslayer came out when \"Dungeons & Dragons\" was getting to be a big thing where I live, so there was a lot of interest. It was even adapted into a book by Wayland Drew (in a rare instance when a movie preceded a book).\n\nTwo things I like mainly. First, of course: Vermithrax. I rather hope that Dragonslayer is never remade, for there's no way the digital animation done these days could do this magnificent creature justice. New isn't always better. \n\nIt's also nice to see a film which doesn't stereotype Pagans and magicians as evil. In fact, the film treads the whole good-evil line rather lightly; Ulrich displays a certain respect for Vermithrax, even while planning the dragon's demise. \n\nI find it easy to be swept up in the lovely mystery of Dragonslayer: a mystical film from 1981 (a more mystical age)."
