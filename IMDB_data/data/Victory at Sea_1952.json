I have seen other WWII documentaries on television, but where Victory at Sea stands heads and shoulders above them is in Richard Rodgers' music and, most importantly, Leonard Graves' incomparable narration. I just cannot imagine anyone else narrating that documentary. My favorite part is the last half of the final episode, when the men come home. That's what it was all about in the first place."
