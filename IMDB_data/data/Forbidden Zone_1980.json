With the exception of tonight, all of them were in the original black & white. Tonight I watched the colorized. They did a nice job with the colorization. The Princess looks great. But for the most part, I found it distracting. The cheap sets look cheaper. It also cools down the sleaziness of the original version. Also the new version also chickens out and changes some of the original characters' color but as long as the original version is still available, I'm fine with that. I understand.",
