        "reviewBody": "Graffiti Bridge (1990)\n\n1/2 (out of 4) This section is where I normally write a plot description but GRAFFITI BRIDGE doesn't have any sort of story so we will just say that Prince goes up against Morris Day.\n\nGRAFFITI BRIDGE is considered by some to be a semi-sequel to PURPLE RAIN but considering how awful this movie is I'd rather just pretend there's no connection. If anything this film proves that even a genius can have off moments because you've got to wonder what Prince was even trying to do here. The movie has no story. The movie has no acting. The movie has boring love interest in Ingrid Chavez. This is pretty much an extended music video but sadly even the music is bad.\n\nI think even the biggest Prince fan would have a hard time defending this one because there's just one bad scene after another and I'd argue that they're all quite pointless as well. Even worse is that all of the scenes appear to just be Prince showing off his wild costumes. The lack of any real story means you really don't care about the characters, their situations or anything that happens to them. It's easy to see why Prince stayed away from movies after this one."
