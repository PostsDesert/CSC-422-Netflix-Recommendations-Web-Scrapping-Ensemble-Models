In fact, there's a delicious exception to the rule: a woman in her forties who is wise, glamorous and a successful wife and mother. Micheline Presle plays Dee's mother, and she's the one who advises her daughter to treat her husband like a dog. \"Husbands often leave home; pets never do. There must be a reason.\" And, \"Most husbands are not given the affection and consideration of the average dog.\" She smiles knowingly, and Dee begins to follow instructions: \"Never lose your temper with your puppy...Praise him lavishly when he does something right...Make living with you so much fun he never wants to go anywhere else...\" And it works. Food for thought."
