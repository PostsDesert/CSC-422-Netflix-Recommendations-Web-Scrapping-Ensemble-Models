I cannot recall another black and white movie that so well captured the terrifying grandeur of the sea. If you saw and enjoyed \"Ryan's Daughter\", do see this classic of cinema and compare it's storm sequence. What magic Flaherty captured in astonishing cinematography and editing! The setting is wonderful, so do see this film, and hope you too get the opportunity to see the West coast of Ireland when the sea is up and the wind is shrieking. Times may have changed even these more remote parts of Ireland, but nothing will ever overcome the stark and rugged beauty of this glorious landscape so ably captured in \"Man of Aran\"."
