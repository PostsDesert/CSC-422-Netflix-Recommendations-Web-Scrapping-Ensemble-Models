It is a bit laughable at times in terms of plot believability(l (how did Banderes know the Chinese restaurant worker would happen to have the money clip???)\n\nBut crucially ....I never got bored and never looked at my watch\n\nIt's 90 mins which is my best movie length\n\nDumb, inconsistent plot, weird plot developments, poor character narrative and lots of weird funny\n\nHowever...Banderes is a good actor as is the young lad. Nice sunny scenery and good action\n\nGlad I went and I'd recommend going to watch it as a simple fun movie. Go and see it.",
