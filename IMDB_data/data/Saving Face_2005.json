Unfortunately she's not able to do that because she doesn't even manage to fit needle in a pencil (not even turning sheets). That's because she's got an eye illness, but she's a first lady in a foundation bearing his family name and she HAS TO be a surgeon. What a pity life, living under his deceased brother's shadow. The truth is not to be uncovered and eventually murdered occurred.\n\nDet. Barek has got outstanding skills, she can figure out difference between Spanish dialect: \"You don't know that because you're from Nicaragua. I hear it in your voice\". Amazing!",
