        "reviewBody": "Another dismal dud from the British film industry. This has all the things that make the average Brit movie so dire: downbeat story and settings, pretentious 'realistic' performances and an incoherent, showy style. Any film that starts with the death of a character that we - naturally - feel absolutely nothing for gets off on the wrong foot. After a short while we're as confused as poor old unshaven Colin Firth, who wears a puzzled frown throughout. Mena Suvari turns up now and then, but really shouldn't have bothered. Indeed, she might as well have phoned her performance in like she did in American Pie 2. Everything stinks about this film: the laughable press headlines (would The Mirror really have 'Caught You! Killer could be on film' as a header in the circumstances the film presents?), the stupid, grim settings (who lives in a barely converted hospital?) and the obscure, confusing story development that tries to be clever but just annoys. I can't imagine anyone enjoying this turkey.",
