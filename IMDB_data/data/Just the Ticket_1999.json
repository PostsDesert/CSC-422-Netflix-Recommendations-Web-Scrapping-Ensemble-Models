I saw the trailer for this movie at the theater and thought that it looked incredibly stupid. I don't particularly like Andy Garcia or Andi McDowell, but I just watched on a whim and the next thing that I knew I was laughing (and crying). I was really surprised by how well I liked this film!\n\nThe plot was a tad silly, but the characters were so colorful and likeable (even the junky pregnant girl) that I got past the immaturity of the story line. It showed a small bit of the dark underbelly of NY ticket scalping, but the good intentions of everyone counteracted the negativity and the result was very optimistic. Andy Garcia was so good as the romantic lead, I particularly loved the scenes preparing for the big catering and the the kitchen destruction...too funny!\n\nBottom line, I think these two made a great on screen couple and I would recommend this to anyone who like me, enjoys these kinds of films, or to anyone who might need a little cheering up."
