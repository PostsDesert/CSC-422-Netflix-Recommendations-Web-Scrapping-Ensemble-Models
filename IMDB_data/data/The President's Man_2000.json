        "reviewBody": "Well. I remember seeing MIA with Chuck...back in the early 80's that was Action (but if you see it now it is not the best :))). Then I saw this attempt at a movie and thought its actually worse than MIA. I am not sure what has made Chuck Norris such a long lived success in the USA. He has never really made a \"blockbuster\" box office smash like Van Damme or Seagal. Yet he is a likeable actor and seems to have a legend of fans out there.\n\nThis movie however is pretty poor. The stunts are choreographed and noticable. The story line is week (it looks like a tv show pilot). Some of the special effects are atrocious (you just have to see the parachuting out of a stealth bomber). Apart from the fact that you would not be able to do that, take a look at the cartoon image coming out of the plane..its really B grade in so many ways (even C grade).\n\nIts a poor telemovie and not worth the effort of watching, so do yourself a favour and don't make the mistake that I did.",
