Much of it is because I have only visited two of the five parks and I enjoyed watching the other three to plan some upcoming trips. Why did I enjoy it so much? Well, the cinematography is insanely good....among the best you'll find in any nature documentary...about on par with the \"Planet Earth\" series. I loved how the show really emphasized the animals you might encounter in the parks. I also was surprised at how good Garth Brooks' voice was, as I just didn't expect him to sound so professorial! Well worth seeing and at times breathtaking.",
