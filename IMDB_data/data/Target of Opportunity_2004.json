        "reviewBody": "I recently watched the film Target of Opportunity and as far as action films go this one is tops. The 2 guys Dean Cochran and Todd Jensen are terrific. Both stars have great comic timing that really play against the typical boring action type genre. The production value is also very high for a Nu Image film - it looks like these guys actually went out and filmed big action sequences and you can tell it's really the stars doing the stunts. All in all Target was a great movie watching experience and I hope to see more from this team because for once in one of these films you felt like they cared about making a good, fun movie with a decent script and dialogue and weren't just out to make a quick buck with the same rehashed story and actors.",
