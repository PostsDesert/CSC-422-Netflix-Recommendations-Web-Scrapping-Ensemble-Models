It moves very fast, has great images and covers a lot of ground. \n\nWhat I love about it is that it brings together so many aspects of hip-hop. I can't think of another documentary that creates such a clear picture about what hip-hop really is. \n\nWhat is also very impressive is that it was made for so little money! I've seen almost every documentary on hip-hop that you can buy and even though this one was made for a fraction of what others were made for, this one looks as good or better. I'd really like to see the Australian version of the DVD since it has a bunch of extras that the US version doesn't. Does anybody in the US or UK know where to buy the Australian version??\n\nFULL PROPS! I'm looking forward to the filmmakers next project.",
