        "reviewBody": "I've been revaluing Joel Schumacher as a director for some years. I was used to think he was just a typical Hollywood movie maker. But I understood this man does commercial features whenever he needs money (\"Batman forever\", \"Batman & Robin\", \"The client\", \"A time to kill\"), as he gets it he manages to do good and more personal films.\n\nIn fact his mainstream movies are quite boring and mannered. Fortunately Schumacher is much better with more alternative or low-budget films (\"Falling down\", \"Tigerland\", \"Phone booth\"). \"Veronica Guerin\" belongs to this category.\n\nI'm also happy, in this case, that a blockbuster producer like Jerry Bruckheimer manages not to spoil the movie with artificial tricks.\n\nVeronica Guerin seems to me a symbol of Irish tragicalness. I mean, the tragicalness you can find in works of James Joyce and Oscar Wilde, in stories and legends of Ireland as well. Sadly, her story is true.\n\nThe film has the right speed in presenting all the facts, it is simple and well acted -Cate Blanchett's performance is outstanding.\n\nMaybe Joel Schumacher, in the final part, looses a little the sense of rhythm because he wants us to be moved and touched (and we are, indeed. Because it's a shame that a woman and a brave journalist as well had to pay that price). But it's a true story, as I said. The film is valid because it denounces the \"conspiracy of silence\" and inaction from authorities."
