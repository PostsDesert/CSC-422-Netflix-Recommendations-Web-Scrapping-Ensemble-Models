        "reviewBody": "A very winning cast, great location, superb kids' story to work with, good production make for some campy scariness for kids with entertainment for mom and dad as well. Charming little movie that appeals to the kid in all of us.The predicament of the cows really did make me laugh out loud.\n\n The acting by one and all was excellent, especially Richard E. Grant as the head of the vampire family. He brought a non-threatening, yet nerve wracking (well, for kids, anyway) presence to the movie. His charming powers over Mrs. Thompson were hysterical, and the entire cast did very well with this movie.\n\nOne for the kids that mom and dad will enjoy sitting through, which is a rarity anymore, except for the likes of Shrek.\n\nOh, and I can't omit Rollo Weeks, as The Little Vampire himself. He was so charming, so perfectly nailed the role of Rudolph. As well as the role for arguably the cutest kid in movies, Jonathan Lipnicki, as Tony Thompson. The crush Anna had on him was acted out adorably by Anna Popplewell, as well. There was just great acting all around in The Little Vampire.\n\nA job well done by all involved. This will make my list of movies to purchase just to share with my grandkids that someday I'll have to spoil. Campy, scary enough for the little ones and entertaining for their parents. What's not to like?",
