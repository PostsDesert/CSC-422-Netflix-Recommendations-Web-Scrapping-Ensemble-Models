Although you wouldn't notice its not supposed to be a typical Chow comedy until well into the second half, because the convoluted, meandering story allows Chow to do all his usual comedy gimmicks before turning into a more serious historical action adventure.\n\nThere is plenty to admire here: a fun cameo from directing legend Yuen Woo Ping, the \"sleeping fist\" kung-fu style, some well mounted large-scale battle scenes, and the usual fantastical action sequences typical to the fantasy/swordplay genre.\n\nUnfortunately, its all a bit baffling, the plot is uninvolving, and its all rather inconsistent in tone (one minute Chow is a bumbling idiot, the next he's a stoic hero).\n\nWorth a look, particularly if you prefer martial arts to comedy, but not Stephen Chow's best.",
