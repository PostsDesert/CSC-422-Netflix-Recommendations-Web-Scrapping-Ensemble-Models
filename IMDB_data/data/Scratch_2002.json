Rather, SCratch and Burn's skits were more like music videos, and the style of their rap, thematically even, are not too far off from the rap of the late 80s: slick rick, fresh prince, biz markee...and that is a HUGE compliment to this show. it would be a shame if these genius' produced something in the style of 50 cent and his g-unit with their monotonous droning.\n\ni would LOVE to have this show on DVD. but MTV doesn't often believe in it's good shows. M does not stand for Music for MTV, rather it stands for Mediocrity...it's a shame too because SCRATCH and BURN was for a very short time was what kept me watching that channel. and i'm all that matters, right?"
