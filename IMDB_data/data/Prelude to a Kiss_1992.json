I remember seeing it on cable some time ago and being very touched by the story and the great performance of Baldwin. Having seen it again, its one of my favorite movies..and probably the best romance in my DVD collection.\n\nIts a modern day fairy tale with a moral and timeless wisdom. It ponders the nature of true love....and then gives an answer. It asks the more contemporary question..\"what do you do when the person you love becomes sick, repulsive and dying?\"\n\nOf course, this is an allegory for aids but the concept of loss is universal and Baldwin gives a great performance in conveying feelings of loss and helplessness."
