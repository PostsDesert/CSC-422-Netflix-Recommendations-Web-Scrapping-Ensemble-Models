The animation is great, the story is great, and even the additional characters are great too.\n\nThis is also the first time they have Inspector Zenigata playing a bigger role.\n\nIt's all taken place in Tokyo and has a lot to do with this new Aquapolis resort and a young woman named Maria who has a connection with the owner of Aquapolis, Micheal Susuki.\n\nHas all the good stuff you'd expect from a good Lupin TV movie.\n\ni highly recommend this to all the Die-Hard Lupin Fans.\n\nI give this a 8/10.",
