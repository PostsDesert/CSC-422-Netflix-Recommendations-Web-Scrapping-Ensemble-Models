I'd recommend almost any other Korean movie over this. The sheer number of times I found myself scoffing at the actions of the characters, the plot \"twists\" or the character \"dialogue\" were too numerous to count.\n\nAny deeper reading about the supposed message of the movie only serves to obscure the fact that this was one horrible flick.\n\nThe only positive comment I can make (as someone on the message boards noted) was some of the very interesting artwork; I quite liked it.",
