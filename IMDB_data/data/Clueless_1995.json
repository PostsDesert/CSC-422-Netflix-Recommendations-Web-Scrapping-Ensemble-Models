        "reviewBody": "Clueless (1995) is a movie my daughter and I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline for this picture surrounds Cher, a upscale high school student with good grades, looks and lots of money. As she looks for love she's also happy playing match maker for her friends and a particular new student. As everyone starts finding love she finds herself starting to get jealous.\n\nThis movie is directed by Amy Heckerling (Fast Times at Ridgemont High) and stars Alicia Silverstone (Batman & Robin), Paul Rudd (Ant-Man), Stacey Dash (Moving), Donald Faison (Scrubs), Jeremy Sisto (Wrong Turn) and Wallace Shawn (The Princess Bride).\n\nThe writing for this picture is excellent with fantastic characters, dialogue and circumstances. The cast is perfectly selected and Silverstone delivers her character to perfection. The soundtrack is also good as is the comedic content. The terminology is good and the teachers matchmaking, driving scenes and couples conversations all made me crack up.\n\nOverall this is a very well done picture that is an absolutely must see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it.",
