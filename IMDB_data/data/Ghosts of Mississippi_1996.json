        "reviewBody": "It may not be the best film about race relations in the South. Mississippi Burning and A Time To Kill have more intensity, but it is still compelling and worth watching for some great performances.\n\nAlec Balwin (Bobby DeLaughter) turned in a fine performance. Personally, I feel it is the best he has ever done.\n\nJames Woods was perfect as Byron De La Beckwith. He channeled the venomous hatred and cocky arrogance so familiar in those who were consumed with their self-worth, gained by stomping on others. This performance resulted in an Oscar nomination in a year with many fine performances.\n\nDixie DeLaughter, played by Virginia Madsen, shows how ingrained racism is in the South, and how difficult, if not impossible, it is for a marriage to survive with a disparity in views, whether it be race or politics.\n\nI also enjoyed seeing Wayne Rogers as Morris Dees, even if it was a small role.\n\nThis is an important film that should be seen by all who care about the state of race relations in this country.\n\nIt should also be see by all young people so they can see a sign at a gas station saying 22 cents a gallon. Those were the days.",
