        "reviewBody": "This Korean martial arts film is centred on a woman whose father was murdered when she was just a baby because he refused to use his martial arts skills to help a group oppressing the people. She is trained by a Shaolin master until she becomes an expert in kung fu then sets out for her revenge. In this she is assisted by an equally skilled stranger and a group of woman martial artists.\n\nIt must be said that this is fairly low budget and the action is nowhere near as well choreographed as modern wuxia films... still it manages to be exciting with lots of fight scenes. This action sees a good variety of weapons as well as the standard kicking and punching. The acting looks decent although it is hard to really judge as the UK DVD release of the film I watched was rather poorly dubbed into English and for almost half the film the soundtrack was lagged the picture by about five seconds... so much for quality control! At least the story wasn't too complicated. Overall not a bad example of the genre; I just wish the version I watched was of a better quality.",
