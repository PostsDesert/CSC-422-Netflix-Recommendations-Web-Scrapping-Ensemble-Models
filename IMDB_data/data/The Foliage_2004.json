        "reviewBody": "A lovely story that like Chinese films, ends in a heart breaker. I did feel that the love story was quite heart wrenching, and the movie overall deserves considerable applause (one of the best Chinese films I have seen). However I am extremely disappointed in the director's choice of lead female actress. Being Taiwanese, she has none of the common characteristics of a mainlander. She is flat and boring, and delivers her lines in a recitation manner that severely detracts from the movie. Plus her accent is extremely distracting, sticking out like a sore thumb. It really taints the movie's setting and mood. But besides the mistake in the female lead, it is a movie worth watching.",
