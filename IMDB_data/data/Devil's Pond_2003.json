        "reviewBody": "I had a difficult time trying to decide whether to watch or not the movie. I mean, it stared Tara Reid! Soon after the plot develops, I found myself paying attention to the events but only because of Tara Reid's intention to act decently. Let's face it, she's not a good actress but at least in this movie she tries to to do it fine. Kudos for her; she tried it at least.\n\nAfter convincing myself that she did a nice effort, the movie delivered a fine surprise for me when it became a thriller about a psychopath husband trying to convince his new hot bride that he really loves her although he stalked her before and well, more twisted situations.\n\nTrue, the acting is not that good (Kip Pardue delivers a fine performance though) and you need proved, talented actors to carry on 90 minutes of an intense dialog; I mean, there are only two characters in the whole movie.\n\nThe settings are really good and somber, plus the situations ask for a sad atmosphere. Well done for the cinematography and art direction.\n\nOverall this is a movie to just watch once and when it airs on cable. It's not a keeper or memorable, but it still deserves a slight chance.",
