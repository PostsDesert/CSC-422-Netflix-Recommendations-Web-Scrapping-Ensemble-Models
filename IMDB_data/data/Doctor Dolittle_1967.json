        "reviewBody": "Cheery, fun musical from Fox. Dr. Dolittle has the ability to talk to animals, and takes Emma (Samantha Eggar) and Matthew (Anthony Newley) with him to find the mythical giant pink sea snail.\n\nThe songs are forgettable, but the cinematography, costumes and set design are good, and Rex Harrison is much less hammier than he was in My Fair Lady. The main problem with the film is Anthony Newley, who has one of the worst Irish accents afflicted upon the movie going public. Richard Attenborough has a nice cameo as a circus owner, and gets to sing the film's catchiest song. 3/5",
