        "reviewBody": "Poison Ivy 2: Lily is a great movie, much better than the first. While the original Poison Ivy was very tame (it's only nudity was a brief shot of a bare butt) Poison Ivy 2: Lily contains loads of nudity. Lily arrives at an art college where she takes up with sculptor Gredin and poses nude for her art teacher Donald Falk. Soon Donald is so obsessed with Lily that he tries to rape her and that leads to some tragic consequences for all involved. I did enjoy the original Poison Ivy but enjoyed the 2nd much more because it dared to show more bare flesh and had a good storyline. I recommend that you see both films.\n\nPoison Ivy 2: Lily is Rated R for strong sexuality and nudity, adult language, and for some violence.\n\nNOTE: Poison Ivy 2: Lily was released in two versions: an R Rated version that trims some sex scenes, and an UNRATED version that contains two more minutes of sexual sequences."
