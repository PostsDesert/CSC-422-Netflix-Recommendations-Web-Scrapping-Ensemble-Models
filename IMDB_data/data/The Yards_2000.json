There are only a couple of subplots, and they are very basic, easy-to-understand concepts that do not get in the way of the main theme.\n\nI would also contest that this is a 'romance'. Whilst this is one of the subplots, putting it under 'romance' as one of the main genres is mildly misleading.\n\nThe performances from all central actors are excellent. As my title suggests this is a slow-burner but Walburg puts in a great performance and I DID care what happened to him in the end.\n\nOh, and listen out for the soundtrack. It really is quite striking.",
