It begins first with a simple apron with the name Dorothy stitched in it. As the boundary is pushed each day, the junkie ultimately must dress and act like Dorothy 24/7.\n\nThis potentially exploitative film cleverly becomes a character study as we see the trip that the abuser takes to come into the disturbing arrangement that he and his victim ultimately reach.",
