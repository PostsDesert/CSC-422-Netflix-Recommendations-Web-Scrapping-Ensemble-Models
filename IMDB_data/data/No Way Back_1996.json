The movie as a whole is not bad but I get the feeling that the director wasn't sure exactly what type of movie he wanted to make. And after watching it, I still don't know. Is it an action move, a romantic comedy, a 48hr buddy movie... A 1\\2 hour into what I thought was a basic action movie, it kinda just started to jump around. One scene it's action movie, next scene it's a romantic comedy, next scene it's an action comedy movie, etc...\n\nBesides the whole schizophrenia stuff, the movie is really not that bad. I pretty much like anything with Crowe and everyone with the exception of Slater is pretty good.\n\nI recommend this movie as long as there's not a good game."
