        "reviewBody": "I like Godzilla movies for all the right things. Number one they are the stupidest movies on earth. When it comes to Godzilla movies; the stupider the better. This movie makes no sense at all; and that makes it the all time winner. Ichiro in any other movie would be considered a seriously mentally handicapped sad story but in this movie he is a hero and a really cool kid. The toy maker Shinpei also makes this movie great. The bank robbers offer a small break from the hallucinations of Ichiro which is the premise of the entire movie. The dinner with Shinpei is my favorite scene of this movie; it makes you want to cook up some oriental food to make this a theme movie; to your meal. Some how out of all this corny, cornucopia of a Godzilla masterpiece; the movie has a happy ending of Ichiro standing up to the bully's.",
