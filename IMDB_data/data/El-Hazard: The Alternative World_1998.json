The storyline is original and unique, Fujisawa and Miz relationship is nice/funny but that's as far as it goes, even the depressing EH OAV 2 comes second after this.\n\nEH alternative world's characters are dull, and the \"bare\" jokes are absurd and obviously fan service, making it close to Aika level.\n\nMakoto is not shown to be very serious in bringing Ifurita back as well, and the ending seems to be forced. Overall 4/10"
