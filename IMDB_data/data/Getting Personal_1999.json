        "reviewBody": "This was definitely a good show. It started off as a mid-season replacement and Fox didn't anticipate it becoming such a hit with the audiences. The show obviously had good writers at the time because it was funny and simple. Vivica Fox and Duane Martin, who had been in a sitcom before with Patti LaBelle \"Out All Night\" had a great chemistry and Jon Cryer being added to the mix made the show all that more enjoyable. I fondly remember how cool he was from the movie \"Hiding Out\".\n\nOf course, what always happens to a show when the major stars are black? It gets canned. Its like trying to figure out the mystery of the vanishing sock in the washing machine...they go in a pair and come out one...go figure. The second season started off great and then things changed...first sure sign a black show is on the outs, they change actors or get rid of actors or they change the whole dynamics of the show. Next comes the constant changing of time slots, which confuses the viewers who are looking for the show in the old time slot, guaranteed to lose viewers and drop ratings and then POOF.....its canned.\n\nIsn't Hollywood ever going to learn that if a black show works, gets good ratings and brings more viewers, then it ain't broke so quit trying to fix it until its broke."
