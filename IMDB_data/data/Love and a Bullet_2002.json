        "reviewBody": "When I first saw the trailer to this movie on some other action DVD, I thought, \"You must be kidding me. This has got to be the worst straight-to-video HK-action rip-off ever made.\" But after watching the first few minutes of it on cable, I knew the trailer was all wrong. They'd focused on all the wrong elements. I found \"Love and a Bullet\" to be something of a black \"Snatch\"-type movie (no jokes, now), very tongue-in-cheek and enjoyably self-referential. The final battle, as silly as it was, was easier to swallow after the movie's setup. After all, it's not a straight gangsta-action movie; it's more of a black comedy. In both senses of the word. Definitely worth the 90-minute investment.",
