        "reviewBody": "This series features Lewis Lovhaug reviewing the various \"Power Rangers\" seasons. I admit to not ever being a fan of PR. Well, maybe when I was really young, but certainly not anymore. This series features footage from the episodes with him narrating giving the plot and his opinion. I admit to watching these episodes out of order. I just see them when they appear on his YouTube channel.\n\nI admit that it is more entertaining to hear about the seasons he hates. Then again, it's nice to hear about his favorite ones. I guess it's best when it's just extreme love or extreme hate. HOPR's a pretty weird acronym. If I ever too become a fan, I'll know where to start. I think the logo takes up a lot of space in these videos because he's afraid of violating fair use. ***1/2",
