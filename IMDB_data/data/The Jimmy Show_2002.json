        "reviewBody": "It started a little slow but it is a great show. I think even the guests love going. I find it funny and refreshing and you really get to know a different side of the guests. Some of the games are really silly but for the most part he is incredibly funny and respectful with both, the audience and the guests. I frankly don't see anybody competing with him. We love Conan and have for years but since Fallon started airing, we don't watch Conan anymore. On a different note, Fallon is updated and seems to be more in the loop and in the know with younger audiences.. His interaction with the Roots is very funny and the games with the celebrities are creative. I assume he has a much bigger budget than other late night talk shows for the quality of his sketches and games. He really brings it in terms of having very current guests. The segments like #hashtag, or the books to never read are hilarious. I don't love the thank you notes but it seems like people do.",
