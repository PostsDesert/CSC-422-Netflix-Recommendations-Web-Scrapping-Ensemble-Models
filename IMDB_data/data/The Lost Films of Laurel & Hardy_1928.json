Instead it's kind of a bore, scenes set in jungle are amazing but there are too many slow drawn out parts that deal with drama back in civilization. \n\nThe acting by Hunnam is mediocre at best, Sienna Miller gives a great performance too bad she's not in more of the movie. \n\nOverall it's not horrible but it's also just average"
