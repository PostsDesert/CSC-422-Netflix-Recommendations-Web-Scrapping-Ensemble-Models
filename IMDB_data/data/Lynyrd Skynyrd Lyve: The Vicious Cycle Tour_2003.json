        "reviewBody": "Rock and roll bands come and go as time passes. Some are forgotten and some seem to retain their glory forever. Many are devastated by tragic events which encompass them throughout their career. Some move on, some do not.\n\nAfter the death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant and other band members in an airplane crash in 1977, the band appeared to have met it's demise as well. Many years passed by before the remaining band members decided to resurrect the famous Lynyrd Skynyrd name and continue the venue of producing Southern Rock and Roll. Ronnie's younger brother, Johnny, was recruited to take on the job of lead vocalist.\n\nThe sound of Ronnie Van Zant's voice will never be duplicated perfectly. It is my opinion his brother Johnny does a fine job of filling his shoes in an effort to keep the Skynyrd saga going as do the other replacement members of the reformed band.\n\nWhat you will see and hear in the video will be the closest rendition of the original band you will find anywhere. Although I personally was looking for a reincarnated version of the originals fully knowing it was impossible, I was very content with what I found. I highly recommend this video as a must see for any Lynyrd Skynyrd fan.",
