        "reviewBody": "I have loved this movie since it came out in 2003. It is well written, well, acted, and is realistic about subjects most people ignore.\n\nTracy (Evan Rachel Wood) is an average, well-behaved 13 year old entering middle school. While she struggles at home with her recovering alcoholic mother Mel (Holly Hunter), Tracy's main concern is to be liked by the popular girls. Evie Zamora (Nikki Reed) is the queen bee, and after she teases Tracy about her clothes, Tracy steals a wallet to impress her and they quickly become best friends. Evie is a deeply troubled girl who lies, steals, wears provocative clothing, has promiscuous sex, does drugs, and is abused and neglected by her guardians. As Tracy becomes more and more like Evie, engaging in similar bad behavior, her permissive mother totally loses control over her. Tracy is further agitated by her deadbeat dad and Mel's recovering addict boyfriend. Evie and Tracy are inseparable in their dysfunction, and when Evie is away Tracy often cuts herself. Tracy continues to spiral out of control with Mel watching helplessly, and Evie holding her hand through the entire thing.\n\nThis movie is good, but sometimes hard to watch. I find it very different from other movies because there are no character you ALWAYS sympathize with. You sometimes feel bad for and sometimes can't stand all of the three main characters. They are well-rounded and realistic. It saddens me that people often misinterpret the actions of the girls, who clearly have some traumatic pasts and inadequate parenting, as just \"sluts\" or that they \"just need an ass whooping.\" It's very clear to see the pain, childishness, and desperate need for guidance in these kids if you pay attention. A must watch for anyone that lives or works with teenagers.",
