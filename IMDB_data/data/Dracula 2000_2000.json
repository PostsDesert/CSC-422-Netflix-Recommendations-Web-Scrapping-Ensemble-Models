        "reviewBody": "Let's face it, can you count the number of Dracula movies? The charmers from the 70s and 80s are severely dated by today's standards. Christoper Lee is camp at best, but not at all scary. You can guess the budget in the innumerable B's. I do like some of the esoteric versions like Byzantium and Only Lovers Left Alive, but they are slow burners. Camp take-offs like the Blade and Underworld series are fun, but are they really vampire movies? Yeah, I suppose.\n\nAnyway, this one has always been one of my favorite actual Dracula movies. There are lots of actors in it who later made it bigger. It did go a bit overboard in places - like the ending!!! but other than that, no real slow parts and lots of nods to the older Dracula tales. Gerard does a believably spooky job. I think they based the Netflix Drac on Gerard. Never did like the emaciated looking ones like Prime's version. Anyway - it's in my collection, and been watched a few times.",
