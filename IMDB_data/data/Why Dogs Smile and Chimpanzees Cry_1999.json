From the elephants turning instantly into a well organized army to attend to a baby stuck in the mud to the family dog that throws herself under a car to save a fallen human child, this film will evoke emotions from you that may surprise you. I can't imagine this movie not being put into schools to show our kids that we're not actually alone on this planet. Reasoning, wonder, and even logic are not our exclusive domain. When you see the wolves mourning the lowest member of the pack weeks and even months after her passing, you may just feel a little closer to all members of the \"food chain\". Seriously, I didn't want it to end.",
