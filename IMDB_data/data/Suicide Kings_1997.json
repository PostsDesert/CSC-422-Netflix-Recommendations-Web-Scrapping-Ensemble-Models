However, nobody can outsmart Chris Walken! He uses so much reverse phychology in this movie. He even outwits his arch enemy/impersonater!! I am speaking of the comic Jay Mohr! He and Jay have great banter together. Jay plays a rotton jerk. I would love to see Suicide Kings part 2. However, that would be hard because one of the main characters can't be in part 2. Rent the DVD. The alternate ending is brutal! I rate this one a huge thumb up!",
