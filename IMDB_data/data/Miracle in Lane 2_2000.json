But little Frankie Muniz is adorable and carried this movie. All the other actors are pretty decent as well. It's cool to this was based on a true story. This movie covered some heavy topics without getting too heavy. The brother dynamic was sweet though the actors were kind of obviously older than the characters ages they were portraying. Not the best movie, but it was a sweet story. I'd recommend a watch.",
