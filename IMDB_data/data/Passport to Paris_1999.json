I was bored and it was raining out and my cousin begged me to watch this with her. It's cute and all but I wasn't really part of the target audience. I really don't get what's so likeable about the Olsen twins except that they have cute faces and make G-rated straight-to-video movies. Well this is their first movie in a way with the same plot, all the movies they make after this copycat this plot. It's cute how the Olsens have their first onscreen kiss. My cousin loved it, I kind of like Olsen movies, it's my guilty pleasure. I liked \"It Takes Two\", \"Switching Goals\" and all the ones they did when they were little except for a few. It was quite cheesy and had a predictable outcome, but it was sweet, I know this is how you DON'T want your little girls to turn out like but it's still wholesome and somewhat entertaining, but the Olsens are horrible actresses! Okay so 3.5/10 from me and 5.5/10 for the target audience."
