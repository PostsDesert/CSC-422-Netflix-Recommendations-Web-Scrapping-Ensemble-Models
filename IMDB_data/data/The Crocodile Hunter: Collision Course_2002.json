Overall, it felt like some National Geographic documentary spliced with an actual movie. While the different aspect ratios of the digital film and the celluloid was a little annoying, it didn't take too much away from the film. Steve Irwin, despite all of his goofiness and weirdness, is quite a person to admire considering he tries to teach, speak about conservation, and defy death (much of the time) all in one sound bite. Sometimes corny, most of the time breathtaking (due to Irwin's animal interaction), this film is worth taking your kids to. A guiltless pleasure to watch.",
