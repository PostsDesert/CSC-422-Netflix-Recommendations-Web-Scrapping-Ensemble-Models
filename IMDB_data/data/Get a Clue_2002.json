There actually IS a plot, and the minimal level of \"contrived perkiness\" will make the film more palatable to Adult viewers.\n\nOn the positive side, there are NO superheroes in the entire film, and no overly caffeinated High Schoolers pretending to be Pop Stars. IT makes for a refreshing change of pace from the more modern Disney films.\n\nThis is not High Quality Entertainment, but it is an entertaining little film which you can watch with your family and not be disturbed by the content.",
