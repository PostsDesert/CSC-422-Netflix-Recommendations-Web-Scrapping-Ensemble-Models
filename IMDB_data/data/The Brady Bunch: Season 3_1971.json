        "reviewBody": "I saw this on Netflix, and being a fan of \"The Brady Bunch Movie\", and \"A Very Brady Sequel\", and while I didn't have high expectations, I didn't take it too seriously either.\n\nFirst let's start off with the Bradys, aside from Cary Cole and Shelly Long reprising their roles as Mike and Carol, none of the Bradys look remotely close to the original Brady or the movie Bradys. I honestly thought they got a 4-year old to play Cindy.\n\nThen there's Alice, oh Alice, she seemed more like a cartoon. Then there's Greg, who looks like he had a bad perm and is in competition with Alice in the 'overacter' category.\n\nI remember the strange feelings Greg and Marcia had towards each other in The Brady Sequel, but this movie pushes the envelope, from Greg talking to a girl about her breasts at a drive in movie, or Marcia praying to increase her bust, things the real Bradys would never talk or even *think* about, and yes I could have done without the Greg and Marcia romance scene—I thought we've already gone down that road. It was funnier when someone said something sexual to the Bradys and their innocent mind mistaking it for something else (like Marcia thinking \"Ménage à trois\" written in her yearbook meant \"you're the most\") When the presidential portraits started talking to Jan, I thought was just *too* much.\n\nYes, I did give this movie a chance, and no I didn't like it. It had a couple of \"ha\" moments, but nothing I could call \"laugh out loud\". This definitely has the made for TV feel, with plenty of stock footage and even a still of the U-Haul in the Brady's driveway from the first Brady movie.\n\nAs a side note, I actually thought it was funnier that the under filming locations it listed only Toronto, Canada.",
