        "reviewBody": "Well, I wasn't particularly much a fan of the predecessor movie to \"Shibuya Kaidan 2\" (aka \"The Locker 2\"), but I still opted to sit down and watch the 2004 sequel anyway.\n\nAnd perhaps I should have listened to that voice at the back of my mind telling me to skip on this movie, but I was hoping that it would be better than part one. Unfortunately it wasn't. But at least it was a relatively short movie to sit through, as it ran for 71 minutes only.\n\nThe acting performances in the movie were dubious at best, so you're not in for an evening of Shakespearian performances.\n\nVisually then this wasn't an outstanding movie either, so not even on the special effects front could the movie harvest some cheap points.\n\nAs much as I enjoy Asian horror, then \"Shibuya Kaidan 2\" just simply didn't cut it. The movie's storyline and narrative was just too mundane, and the questionable acting performances didn't help bring the movie up to any noteworthy level.\n\nMy rating of \"Shibuya Kaidan 2\" lands on a three out of ten stars.",
