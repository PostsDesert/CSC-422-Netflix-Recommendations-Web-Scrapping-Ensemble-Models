The only film I can think of that is quite as moving is another Sigourney Weaver film, Death and the Maiden.\n\nThe tone of the two is very similar, but there is more hope in this outing. It still isn't something for the kids. But if you love acting, if you love to see real emotions rather than concocted attempts to feel, then watch it. And remember to keep your own Map of the World.",
