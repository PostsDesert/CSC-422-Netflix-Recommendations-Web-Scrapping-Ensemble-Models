I do admit, the acting was second rate, and there were a gaggle of virtual nobodies that made up the cast. But, who are we kidding, that is how it is in Jamaica, and how it can become for immigrants who are denied a fresh start. Mark Danvers, \"Julius\", has a few Jamaican films to his credit, although he has not made even minimal crossover success. It is true that \"Biggs\" is a character that is stereotypical for that particular actor, perhaps because of his foreboding and piercing eyes, or his enormous stature. There is a copious amount of drug selling, murder, and sex, however, I believe that it is educational. Definitely not for young eyes or minds.",
