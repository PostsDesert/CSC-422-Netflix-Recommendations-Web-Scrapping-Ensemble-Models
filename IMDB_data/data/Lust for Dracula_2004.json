There is even something for those who get off on schoolgirls with plaid skirts and white blouses.\n\nDon't try to make any sense out of this film, especially Misty Mundae's \"little bat-bat\" soliloquy. Her sister Jonathan (Julian Wells) had just done a job on her. Of course, Dracula (Darian Caine) shows up at midnight to do a really good job on her.\n\nAll this film needed was a nun to make it fully exploitive."
