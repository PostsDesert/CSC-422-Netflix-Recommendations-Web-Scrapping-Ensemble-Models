Eddie Murphys is an actor who plays amazing and funny in many good movies. This comedy movie is goodÂ  for the whole family and very fun to see it t in a family movie night. If you choose not to see this movie because of its rating then you make a big mistake (believe me it's not a waste of time).its music is great. and you will enjoy watching it. I loved this movie sow match i watched it like about four times. this movie is good for all ages and don't be afraid to show it to your kids because its just fine.",
