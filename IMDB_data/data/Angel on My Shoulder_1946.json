        "reviewBody": "It's the film everyone remembers from those Saturday afternoon TV film matinees. The producer, Charles R. Rogers, had a pretty bleak record when it came to producing films on his own (he was once a V.P. at Universal before going solo). But with \"Angel\" he knocked it out of the park. He inserted age-old movie favorties and combined them into one story. Gangsters, fights, comedy, drama, fantasy... what's not to love?\n\n\"Angel on My Shoulder\" (1946) offers up classic performances by such legendary stars as Paul Muni, Anne Baxter, and Claude Rains. All cast to type, they give performances that are timeless. When you think of any of these stars, think of them in this film and it will give you a pretty good idea as to what each was known for.\n\nAlthough this film was put together during the tail end of World War II and was designed as escapist fun, it holds up today. In fact, it begs for a good re-make. One was done for TV back in 1980, but fell flat. So bad was that version, that they should pay you to watch it. Yet if someone was to do it correctly today, they would have a real gem on their hands.\n\nIf you haven't seen the original 1946 version, catch it on TV. It belongs in everybody's movie-watching repertoire."
