I couldn't picture anyone else play the character of Otto, Tom hanks absolutely nailed it in this. Along with the female lead, she was hilarious and had the whole cinema laughing at times!\n\nI will recommend this film for a long time. I go to the cinema once a week atleast and this has been the best watch in a very long time.\n\nDon't forget to bring your tissues. It'll have you on an emotional roller coaster but you won't want to get off.",
