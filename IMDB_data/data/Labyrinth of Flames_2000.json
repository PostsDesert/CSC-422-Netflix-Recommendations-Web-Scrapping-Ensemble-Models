I guess these days his trademark is showing leggy women in micro-mini-skirts. This results in a lot of \"underwear\" scenes. You've probably seen that in his series Agent Aika. This happens again in Labyrinth of Flames. It seems silly to me and I feel like shouting \"dress sensibly would you!\" to the onscreen characters. This story is about a ninja-wannabe and is pretty forgettable. Be warned that the director sticks to this underwear angle again in his latest effort \"Blitz Tactics Najica\".",
