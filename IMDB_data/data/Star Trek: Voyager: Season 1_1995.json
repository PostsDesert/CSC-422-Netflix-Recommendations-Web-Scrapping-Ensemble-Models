        "reviewBody": "I have a particularly strong attachment to this show and can honestly say it is my favorite in the whole Star Trek universe. I started to watch it from day one all the way to the end even though it took a while for the series to fully realize its potential. The first 3 seasons were good but nowhere near as great as the show would become later yet I hung on, hopeful that something better would come along and then boom, Seven of Nine appeared.\n\nThe show only started to become really wonderful when Jeri Ryan was added to the show with Scorpions at the end of the 3rd season as the cliffhanger for season 4. Somehow, I really connected with this particular character and from then on, they could do no wrong or at least, they could always count on my loyalty to watch. Sure the writing is uneven in places and some episodes are not as great as others but it's true for any series.\n\nI have to say that the number one reason why I connected so strongly with this series is this particular set of characters. Somehow, it all gelled so well and even though I have favorites of course like Seven, The Doctor and Janeway, they all had something interesting to add to the mix and the chemistry always worked for me, even in sub par episodes. But thankfully, even the lowest rated episodes have something interesting to offer.\n\nI was particularly satisfied with how the series ended, the perfect conclusion to one heck of a journey and I still miss it to this day even though I can always watch to my heart's content any time I feel like it. This is connected with a great time in my life and I will always remember if fondly.\n\nA strong 9 stars is well deserved and the 1 star is deducted from the perfect score only because the writing is sometimes not as strong as it should be, especially with episodes not connected to the Borg or Seven of Nine. But still, every single show has something to offer and this series remain one of the very best I had the pleasure of experiencing as it ran for 7 successful seasons and I could not recommend it enough.",
