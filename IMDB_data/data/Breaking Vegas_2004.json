        "reviewBody": "Really a pretty good dramatic recreation of the popular MIT blackjack team. It tells the story without adding a lot of unnecessary dramatics -- the documentary style really suits the subject matter. The actors were quite good and the pacing and editing skillful for such a limited budget film.\n\nThe shortcoming of the movie is that not enough substantive mathematics is explained. I doubt the counting method shown was the one actually used by the players, as there are much more powerful methods that are very nearly as easy to use, such as \"red 7\". Also, they didn't flesh out the mysterious \"other techniques\" used.\n\nThe comment saying that their system could be \"gamed\" is ignorant. The entire basis of counting cards and changing bets when the count is favorable effectively changes the odds in favor of the player. I'm not sure what \"gamed\" means, exactly. If it means the casinos cheated, well, I highly doubt it -- if they got caught, it would cost them many hundreds of times more than any counting team could take.",
