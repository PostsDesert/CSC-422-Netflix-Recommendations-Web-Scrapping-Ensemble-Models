Something caught my attention, and that was well before Sybill Sheperd put on her 'old' black dressing gown. I stayed on until the film ended, and liked it a lot.\n\nKnow what? A few days ago I was doing my zapping again, and came across a title, Once Upon a Crime, just as film credits were rolling. I thought it was a funny title, and stayed to see it what it was about. Soon I was laughing, then I discovered it was the same entertaining comedy, and stayed on until the film ended, and liked it more.\n\nBelieve me: if this comedy makes me laugh out loud three times in a second viewing, barely two months from the first, it's because it is decidedly good.",
