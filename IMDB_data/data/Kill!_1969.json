        "reviewBody": "Having recently watched a number of mildly enjoyable Italian WWII \"B\" films from the same era  BATTLE OF EL ALAMEIN (1969), EAGLES OVER London (1969) and CHURCHILL'S LEOPARDS (1970)  I decided to check this one out as well, given also that it featured Anton Diffring in the lead (surprisingly, not cast as a Nazi but a British officer!). It turned out to be not as worthwhile  then again, the only other films I'd seen from this director where a couple of sci-fi turkeys from the 1970s, so I guess I shouldn't have expected much from it to begin with; even so, I'd still like to catch a reportedly good giallo of his  NAKED GIRL KILLED IN THE PARK (1972)  someday \n\nAnyway, from the title it's obvious that the plot deals  as did BATTLE OF EL ALAMEIN  with Rommel's African Campaign; in fact, halfway through the picture, a suicidal attempt is made on his life by the Allies  but their target turns out to have been merely a decoy (interestingly enough, another low-brow war epic I watched not too long ago  CASABLANCA EXPRESS [1989]  featured a similar ruse, only the victim in its case was to have been Winston Churchill)! \n\nWhile the film offers pretty much standard excitements throughout, with a few of the action sequences being quite competently handled, its central focus lies in the battle-of-wits between martinet Diffring and a 'rebellious' American soldier commissioned to his outfit (blandly played by Carl Parker)  which feels somewhat like 'MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY In The Sand'; still, the comments the film makes about the impossibility of maintaining a code of ethics in wartime are perceptive enoughbut, then, the introduction of a sympathetic German soldier in the second half (captured by the Allies but who ends up having to take care of the wounded survivors of the group through a good part of their desert trek!) seems rather too good to be true.",
