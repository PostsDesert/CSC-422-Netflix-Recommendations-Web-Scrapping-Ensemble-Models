While I rank The Tripods as my favourite sci-fi adventure, this will come as a good second.\n\nI wasn't very old when I saw V for the first time, but I can honestly say it blew me away! And even now almost 20 years later I can still watch it and be in awe like I was way back then.\n\nAnd now I am just waiting for the return of V, which finally seems to be becoming reality. Hopefully it will stick to the basics and not go \"overboard\" like so many re-makes have done over the years. But with Kenny at the helm I doubt that will be a problem, since I happen to know that the legacy of V means a lot to him.",
