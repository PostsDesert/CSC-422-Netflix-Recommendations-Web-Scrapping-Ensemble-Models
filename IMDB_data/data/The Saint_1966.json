        "reviewBody": "\"LE Repas Des Fauves\" can be looked upon as Christian-Jaque's swansong;beyond that point,all that he made can be dismissed as rubbish: weak thriller (LA SECONDE VERITE),ludicrous farces (LES PETROLEUSES\") sub -James Bond (DEUX BILLETS POUR Mexico).\n\nHis saint is not even entertaining;Jean Marais was too old for the role and Henri Jeanson whose lines were nasty ,cruel and witty in the precedent work ,\"le REPAS DES FAUVES\", were so poor you stop and wonder whether such a talented man could have written such drivel!There is not a single line in the whole movie which is funny!not a single one!Jeanson and the director made Leslie Charteris' thriller a spoof ,a farce so ponderous the viewer feels sorry for the talents involved in it.But not for the gamine with hair in bunches ,a millstone around the hero's neck.The boring plot deals with false documents a crook sells to the Germans and to the AmericansAnd let's not forget it,there is a password (which can be heard at least twenty times or more ):\" the elephant is in the soft-boiled egg\". The version starring Val Kilmer is a masterpiece ,compared with this dud.",
