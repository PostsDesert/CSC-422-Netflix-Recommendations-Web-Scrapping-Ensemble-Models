But this movie wasn't what I expected, their was some pretty chicks and that's about it. I think I could have made a better film because it look like they were acting like actors instead of getting into their role. But the music that they were using was cool. There are some funny parts of this movie but you have to probably get buzzed in order to catch them. The freestyle battle was pretty cool I wish there was more battling then listening to MR. LAME spoken word guy. I would recommend watching it just for the hell of it just to see how lame it really is, but then again if you're lame it will fit you perfect.",
