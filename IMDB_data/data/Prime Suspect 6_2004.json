Tennison doesn't even bother with what people think of her anymore and doesn't even care about whether they respect her or not. She blasts them for even suggesting retirement. After that, it only gets better....for those of us interested in the character development of Tennison, all of the stories are good. We care more about how she evolves as a human woman. Boy, has she evolved! She's as hard as nails on the surface and as crumpled up as ever on the inside. I kept waiting for her to weep for all the stuff she's holding in. But, true to form, she holds on and even her letting go is so controlled that you want to scream for her.\n\nNobody can do this stuff like Helen Mirren. She deserves an Oscar and I hope America finds a way to honor her with one. AND SOON!!!"
