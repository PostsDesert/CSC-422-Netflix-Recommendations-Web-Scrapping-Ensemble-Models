The movie doesn't accomplish this as well. While the book is subtle with the Count's revenge, the movie screams for all to hear. \"The Count of Monte Cristo, formerly Edmund Dantes is going to get revenge on his friends!!!\" They left out 3 main characters, and DRASTICALLY changed the ending, they had to, the end involves those 3 characters they left out. But I did like the movie and if you enjoy it too I encourage you to read the book!"
