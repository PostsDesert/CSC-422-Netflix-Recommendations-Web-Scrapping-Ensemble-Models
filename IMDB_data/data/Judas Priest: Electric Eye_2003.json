        "reviewBody": "This DVD is fantastic as a package of vintage Judas Priest material. Included is a concert that, until recently, was only available in scratchy VHS tapes or bootlegs. The concert, from the 1986 Fuel for Life tour, is a snapshot of the band in their prime (including a fully-head-of-hair Rob Halford), with such classics as Hellion/Electric Eye, Living After Midnight, Hell Bent for Leather, Heading Out to the Highway, among others (my favorite is a number off of Defenders of Faith, the Sentinel, which is done very well in the concert). This might be enough for a DVD, but it's packed with enough extras to make the DVD something of a collector's item in the future. It includes all of the 'vintage' Priest videos from the 80s, including some I haven't seen in many years (Johnny B Goode and Hot Rockin' two of them, the latter being quite funny). But this too is also included with rare BBC TV performances of rarer songs, some going back into the mid 70s when Priest were just starting out. For a band that was best seen live and loud, and whose videos were some of the metal staples of the 80s scene, this is a must-have.",
