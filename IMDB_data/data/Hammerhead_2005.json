        "reviewBody": "I would have given this a 2 or 3 except that it is great fun to watch Jeffrey Combs reprise a wacky scientist/doctor reminiscent of Herbert West. Plus there's the added bonus of William Forsythe, that ordinary looking, chubby, everyday man who gets the girl, and whose talent is better than this type of material. The effects are also above average for this type of low-budget material. Combs shows here how great he could have been as a horror icon had he been backed by somebody like Roger Corman, or a Hammer studio, or if he'd been at Universal in the 30s and 40s. It's easy to see him reciting the Colin Clive quote, \"It's alive...alive!\", or as a Peter Cushing type of character, or as Professor Quatermass. He's just not quite as good as a hero, take a look at Dr. Mordrid and you'll see why."
