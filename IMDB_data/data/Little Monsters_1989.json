        "reviewBody": "I remember watching this movie with my dad when I was 9 and it was easily one of the funniest movie I had ever feasted my eyes upon. Howie Mandel's one liners were wildly inappropriate for children. Not too mention Fred Savage who was playing an eleven year old boy was almost just as cheeky which made the hilarity of the characters even more difficult not to laugh at. While it definitely doesn't even come close to being as hilarious as The Goonies it certainly is one of the funniest children's films to come out of the 1980s.",
