        "reviewBody": "This film has some major problems. One,it explains almost nothing. Even if you paid close attention in the '90s to the \"deep-in-the-weeds\" details of Whitewater and the pre-Monica sexual allegations against Clinton---this movie not only assumes you understood this stuff to begin with, but that you remember it too. Mistake. If you are looking for a movie that will shed some light on these subjects, this isn't it.\n\nSecond,the director constantly interrupts the storyline with flashes to clips of \"gangsters\" or \"train crashes\" which I assume are supposed to imply the dastardliness of the \"hunters of the president\". The impact is distracting to the viewer and trivializes the subject at hand. If a class of sophomores somewhere were asks to dramatize this subject, I have the feeling this is what they would come up with.\n\nWeak effort."
