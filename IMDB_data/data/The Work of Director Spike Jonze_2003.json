        "reviewBody": "The work of Director Spike Jonze includes a collection of music videos, short films, and documentaries filmed by the acclaimed director during the 90's.\n\nHis style for music videos is amazingly unique, and are usually a pleasure to watch. But with only 19 of his 50+ videos, casual fans may be steered away.\n\nThe special features are lacking, but since the extra short films on the two-sided disc are incredibly rare, it's a must have for longtime fans. With a 52 page book included with Spike's photos and documentary, it's worth the price.\n\nHighlights include Weezer's \"Buddy Holly\" video, and an assortment of critically acclaimed music videos.\n\nAll in all, a must buy, but more towards the big time fan.",
