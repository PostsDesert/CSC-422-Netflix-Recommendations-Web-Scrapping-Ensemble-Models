        "reviewBody": "This is actually a rather dull film for the most part---the red herrings are preposterous and uninteresting and the sexuality never goes beyond cheap titillation. It hints at more interesting things and nine times out of ten it punks out at exploring those intriguing themes, going for the cheap thrill every opportunity. And it's not that thrilling, period.\n\nBut the ending is amazing. It kept me laughing for weeks after I'd seen the movie. So ludicrous and out of nowhere it comes off like a bad joke, or incomparable idiocy. It still makes me giggle every time I think about it. I can barely type right now.\n\nSee this movie for the last thirty minutes. It's worth it."
