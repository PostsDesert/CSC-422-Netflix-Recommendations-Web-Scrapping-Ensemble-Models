On a weekly basis, \"Cops\" illustrates the courage, integrity, and resilience these officers must possess. To date, there has been no other television show willing to show Americans what happens behind the scenes, and to offer honest portraits of those brave men and women who protect us on a daily basis.\n\nWhen `Cops' started in 1989, it was pure sensationalism, and still charges of prurience are leveled at this show. It has matured over the years to have an almost uplifting theme of good vs. evil. Television would be poorer if it were removed from the airwaves."
