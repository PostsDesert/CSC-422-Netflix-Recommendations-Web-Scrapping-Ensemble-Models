        "reviewBody": "Fascinating and eerie. Essentially , a prime example of all that can go wrong at once. All the elevators and sprinklers were in the center of each floor. A weak and unstable distribution of the weight of each floor by a precarious cantilever design using far too small girders, joints, and bolt-connectors. No cinder block to speak of or not used at all. Wallboard was used instead. About all that didn't happen is that electrical wiring didn't catch fire, like in \"Inferno\". I suspect that, in reality, a similar pancaking effect might have happened in the fictitious story of \"The Towering Inferno\". Again, the \"specs\" were not tough enough for a 100-story building, while it did meet building codes designed for much smaller buildings. The architect of the building looks totally \"spooked\" and guilty about the whole thing . All in the name of more \"retail floor space\" than the solidly built Empire State Building. Beautifully produced by the BBC and not at all dry or boring (to me). Tastefully produced with a minimum of explicit scenes. When you find out why the \"Twin Towers\" were selected as targets, you will be very surprised!",
