        "reviewBody": "This film is not just that typical on the road Middle America odyssey, with frequent stops in kitschy bars and dusty diners. Jackpot has a well written script with a strong focus on character development and interaction. Gries and Morris work well together as a fly-by-night duo. Gries' goofy but personable character allows his mediocre singing to be quite intriguing. The witty dialogue was enjoyable and consistent throughout the film. Most notable is Garret Morris' performance. The film was a clever attempt to show two zealous characters struggle for an unrealistic, waste of a goal. You can't help but be envious of their carefree attitude and at the same time loathe their divergence from ideal responsibilities. It's realism allows for a vicarious experience and an appreciation of great screenwriting."
