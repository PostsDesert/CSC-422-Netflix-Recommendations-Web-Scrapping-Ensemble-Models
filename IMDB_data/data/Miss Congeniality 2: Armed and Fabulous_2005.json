        "reviewBody": "This movie was not bad. This movie was not stupid. It was not a travesty. It was not a black mark. It was a sequel. And it filled that role quite well.\n\nSandra Bullock returned in Miss Congeniality 2, thankfully, and really completely saved it. There was a rumor going around that they weren't going to use her in the sequel, but luckily they realized their mistake. Ms. Bullock makes the show worth watching all by herself. Though she did have an OK ensemble to work with (particularly Heather Burns and Regina King), this is her show, and hers alone. Without her, it could easily have become all of the above listed things.\n\nBut it's not! It's really not bad, and has some genuine laughs along the way, with an especially funny drag queen scene. So, if you're a fan of the original, go see it. It won't compare to the first, and never could have, but it is still worth seeing. 5/10 stars for me.\n\nJay Addison",
