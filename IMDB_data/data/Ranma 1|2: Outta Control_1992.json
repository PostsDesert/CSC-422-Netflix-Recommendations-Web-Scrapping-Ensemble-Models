The story is rather lame and could have been told in about 2 or 3 comic-chapters. The plot girl-guy saves girl isn't really that much different from Movie No. 1. The women's breasts are bigger and the legs are longer, and since all takes place in an exotic beach-environment, the creators have the opportunity of pointing this out to the viewer fairly often. Better than the first, but still not that great. Oh, but I must admit, I thought the main theme was kinda cute.",
