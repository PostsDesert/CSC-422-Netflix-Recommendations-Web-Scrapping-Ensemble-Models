But, you know what, that's been done. Besides, it's just a cartoon.\n\nOne heck of a radical kick-butt awesome cartoon!\n\nThank goodness for these great video collection's of the Girls' greatest adventures. I probably would have never got a chance to see these otherwise. I speak to all the *adults* here when I say that you have GOT to rent these and watch them. No questions asked. (And, oh yeah, the kids will like 'em too I guess.) Very cool, retro looking animation and a hilarious shout-out to the \"Power Rangers\" and the Beastie Boys make this one a winner. Plus, Mojo is quite the quotable one."
