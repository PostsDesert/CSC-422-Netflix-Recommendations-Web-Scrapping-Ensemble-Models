        "reviewBody": "This is singularly the most entertaining movie from Mumbai. I think the credit should go to the incredible music of Himmesh R,The enchanting Choreography,a perfectly chosen Cast,and a brilliant direction by the Doti-clad Duo Abbas-Mastan. This is one of the movies where the talent has been put to good use even the children of lesser talent like Johny Lever. Akshay Khanna may never get a similar oppurtunity to display his talent of a conniving con Artist as he does here. Amisha Patel looks incredible gorgeous with some great dance numbers. Sunny Deol is just perfect as a Tycoon. There is no overacting or filthy gyration in the name of Choreography as in Salman Khan Movies which are bordering on vulgarity. All said and done an enchantingly entertaining film."
