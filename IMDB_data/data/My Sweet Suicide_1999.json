        "reviewBody": "This is an altogether surprising, little picture. At turns delightfully touching and honest, it is a film made GREAT by the superb star turn of Matthew Aldrich. His bravura work as a young man straddling life and death, is one of the BEST film portrayals to grace independent cinema. Mr. Aldrich's uncanny ability to swing deftly through pathos and irony on a dime, ranks this among the classic performances of all time. This fine actor is reminiscent of a young Gary Cooper, by way of Yaphet Kohto, and is a must-see for ANYBODY who hungers for fierce intelligence and unabashed emotional honesty from their favorite actors. I look forward to seeing more of this actor's work in the future!"
