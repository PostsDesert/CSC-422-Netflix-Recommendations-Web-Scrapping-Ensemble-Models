        "reviewBody": "The film was entertaining. It provided a candid look at W, before and after the reality of his \"situation\" (being a viable candidate for President) had really \"sunk in.\" It also provides a great look at how managed are a candidate and the public's view of that candidate. In particular, Rove's role in the entire campaign was apparent (\"Bush's Brain,\" past and present).\n\nAt any stage of W's evolution, one thing was clear in the film: W is socially awkward. His attempts at humor are, most often, ill-timed and unsophisticated; sometimes inappropriate. It reflects an apparent discomfort with himself and with others. I must say that I am not at all comforted by having seen this view of W."
