        "reviewBody": "Fine BBC production about key players in a lesser known period of history, the fact that they are ancestors of Winston Churchill is interesting but really doesn't factor into the story. The real focus is about royal power struggles and the emergence of the Churchill line. A bit stagy and it shows its age in film quality but the performances make all that secondary. John Neville is good but this really belongs to Susan Hampshire as Sarah Churchill who is by turns kittenish, vixenish and noble. A top star in England since the 60's her talent is great and her presence enchanting it's a pity she's not better known. She is in the same league as Diana Rigg, Maggie Smith and Judi Dench.",
