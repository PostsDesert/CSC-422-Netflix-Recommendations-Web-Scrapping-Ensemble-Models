The director has made this a film that is understandable for all ages and makes the realism unique. I would highly recommend this film for families. Even though I loved \"The Passion of the Christ,\" I found this film easier to view for the family. Maybe we'll watch in earnest when the kids are a little older, teens perhaps. All in all this film takes you through an understanding of life as it would have been seen through the eyes of the common person. Perhaps it is this reality that allows people to gravitate toward a love for the film and a commitment to making the viewing of it each year and family tradition. Looking for a great family movie to help teach the faith, this is it.",
