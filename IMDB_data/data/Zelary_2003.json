        "reviewBody": "Set in Eastern Europe during the Nazi occupation, this is the story of a young, urbane, freedom fighter woman who faces discovery and capture every day in the big city. When the heat gets too high, her leaders suddenly send her away, to lessen the risk on her and everyone else. She just as suddenly finds herself with people she does not know, understand, or even like  who make decisions for her in an isolated, \"backward\" mountain village. How could life get any worse? What is her reason for living any longer? Well, she will see she will see... one hard day at a time. This is a quietly powerful film, full of natural grandeur, human pettiness, the ebb and flow of pain and pleasure, forgiveness and revenge, taking and giving, and faith and hopelessness. \"Zelary\" is epic in scope, and full of Life's lessons. It lacks nothing."
