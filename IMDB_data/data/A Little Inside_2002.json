How long had Ed Mills (Abby's father) and Nancy, the next door neighbor, known each other? How was it that Nancy had no idea how Ed Mills' wife died? Also, Nancy's constant interfering in the raising of Abby should have made Ed Mills turn to someone else to watch Abby. Enter, Abby's friends Mother, Sarah Parker. Why wasn't she asked to watch Abby? There were so many inconsistencies in this movie but the one constant was Abby. For someone so young, to be able to carry a movie like she did, that alone made it bearable.",
