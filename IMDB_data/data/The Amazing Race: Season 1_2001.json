I think that it is a great idea to get the kids involved, but I really think that the families should start going into different countries. Even if their are little kids, countries like Canada and Mexico should be fine. I cannot wait until the end of this years addition. I don't know about you, but my bet is on the Linz family. They seem very strong and competitive. After watching tonight's episode (Shroeder family eliminated), I think they might start to bring the families into Canada. So far, I have liked the idea of all challenges being fit for all ages. Even if some are a little bit to easy, their good for the kids!!I cannot wait until the end....peace out!"
