There were scenes recreating the scenes of Stooge features blending the then with the now but you must watch it to see and understand it for yourself. There was also a scene of Barry Williams a.k.a. \"Greg Brady\"singing The Stooges three the stooges three that's the way they remain the Stooges three to the tune of \"The Brady Bunch The Brady Bunch that's the way we became The Brady Bunch.\"Maybe by Barry's meaning of That's the way they remain The Stooges three and even though there are 6 team members or 7 if you count Emil Sitka and how they were only 3 at each time that they appeared.There's even an entry in my Brady Bunch Book of Three Stooges Haircuts too.\n\nTruly,Stephen \"Steve\" G. Baer a.k.a.\"Ste\" of Framingham,MA.USA.",
