This movie too has some some beautiful gardens, lakes, hill tops houses, etc.\n\nThe editing ruined everything.\n\nCos of the shaky cam n fast cut editing, one cannot make out what is going on during the fight scenes.\n\nThe character of Snake Eyes is more spiteful n the character of Shadow Storm more sympathetic.\n\nHow conveniently the clan n the Major Scarlett work together with Baroness, a Cobra member.\n\nAlso how easily Snake Eyes forgives his dad's murderer n after that fight alongside Baroness inspite of knowing that Cobra gang gave the orders to eliminate his dad.\n\nI miss those old ninja movies man.",

Joe Origins stars Henry Golding as Snake Eyes, a tenacious loner who is welcomed into an ancient Japanese clan called the Arashikage after saving the life of their heir apparent. Upon arrival in Japan, the Arashikage teach Snake Eyes the ways of the ninja warrior while also providing something he's been longing for: a home. But, when secrets from his past are revealed, Snake Eyes' honor and allegiance will be tested - even if that means losing the trust of those closest to him.",
