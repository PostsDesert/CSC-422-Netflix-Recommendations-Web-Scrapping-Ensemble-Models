        "reviewBody": "This film had potential, but I, and I suspect those involved in making it, really have no idea who it was actually aimed at.\n\nSimplified too much to appeal to more mature kids (of all ages), too much involvement from rather cardboard parents for any escapism, the moralizing getting in the way of the story too much for younger kids and too obvious for older ones, the \"puzzles\" far too simply solved.\n\nOverall, far too much certainty. For a movie with this kind of story to succeed, I think a lot more ambiguity and uncertainty is required - hints at what's going on, who the characters are, and what's going to happen, rather than great big illuminated signposts. It could probably do with taking itself rather more seriously, too.\n\nI only find myself wondering how they managed to string it out for so long.",
