        "reviewBody": "Beautifully filmed surf film which doesn't try and achieve anything too clever. Works really well as a chill-out film with some fantastic surfing. The whole film involves 4 surfers taking time off from the pro-tour and just surfing they way they want to. Would definitely encourage everyone who loves to surf to check this one out as it features some of the best surfers in the world (including Kelly). Excellent soundtrack featuring G Love, Ozomatli and of course Jack himself. Wish he'd only get a bigger name over here in England! 9/10"
