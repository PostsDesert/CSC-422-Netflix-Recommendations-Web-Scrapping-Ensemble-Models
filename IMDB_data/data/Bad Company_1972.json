We were transfixed by the sheer power of this magnificent American drama. Last weekend, with a recently released low speed version of the move, our seventeen-year-old son watched it for the first time and simply said \"They should put it back in the theaters!\"\n\nThis is one of the most overlooked, underrated, forgotten and ignored great films of the last twenty-five years. Acting, story, editing, photography, score - all are right on the money. My eternal thanks to Jaffe and Benton for having the courage of their convictions."

        "description": "This tale of friendship and survival set during the days of the 1860's focuses on a roguish group of runaways living by their wits and natural instincts. Two of them in particular are complementary opposites: Drew is a good boy from God-fearing stock in Ohio, out West to evade the draft. Jake is a scruffy scoundrel - a saddle tramp not above a little larceny here and there. Along the trail they encounter a variety of varmints and renegades. And eventually, they find themselves - older and wiser for the journey and friendship.",
