When no help arrives, they begin to suffer mysterious and gruesome fates at the hands of something more terrifying than the war itself.\n\nI found this film to be very enjoyable, it has a wonderfully creepy and suspenseful atmosphere, and the setting for the movie is perfectly dark and mysterious to heighten the plot.\n\nDeathwatch is solidly directed and well cast and is a very different take on the horror genre as a whole that is refreshing to see.\n\n7/10",
