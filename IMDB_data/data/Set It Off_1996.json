I love these gang-type films and merely thought it was gonna be all blood and shootin...but it is so sad that its unbelievable. I cried hysterically at the end, laughed in the middle and just generally loved it. All the women were fantastic in the film especially Queen Latifa and Jada Pinkett, all really believable. You feel for the way they live and how they struggle to get by. More than that though was how wonderful the film was. Im trying to get my hands on a UK copy so I can watch it over, and over, and over...JUST WATCH IT!"
