I found that the story to bring out a different part of the Vietnam war that is constantly looked over, well every war for that matter.\n\nStrictly a movie that is about people life story. I keep seeing reviews how they felt it was an \"Anti-American\" film because of a few scenes... Honestly the movie about the emotions of the people who is not in their home country that is being torn up from their own people, and their only way out is to live in a camp that is completely foreign. Try to comprehend that.\n\nThis is a very good movie and it is worth a watch.",
