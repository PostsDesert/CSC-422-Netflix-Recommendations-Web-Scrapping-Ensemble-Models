WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE PRODUCTION. NOW I HAVE NO AGENDA! I AM HONEST! I REVIEW MOVIES & SPECIALS AS A WAY TO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT I HAVE SEEN!\n\nThis special was originally broadcast in 1979. Bing passed away in 1977. If you grew up watching his specials you were sad to hear of his passing. \n\nIn this compilation is a moments from fifteen of Crosby's annual Christmas Specials. Includes guest stars such as Jackie Gleason, Fred Astaire, and David Bowie, with over twenty-five songs, including \"White Christmas,\" \"Silent Night,\" and all of your favorite carols.\n\nThis is well put together special. If you love watching classic television specials then this is the DVD for you",
