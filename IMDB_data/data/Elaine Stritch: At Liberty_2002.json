Think Ethel Merman after hundreds of cigarettes. This show, which ran on Broadway and then in the West End, was well worth seeing and this recording is a good standby if you missed the live event.\n\nIn between memories of her start in showbiz, her time as an understudy, her first big break (in Pal Joey singing 'Zip'), her time in Hollywood, her stage career, her sitcoms, and her alcoholism, Ms Stritch finds time to sing a range of songs including 'Zip', 'The Ladies Who Lunch', 'Broadway Baby', 'Why Do The Wrong People Travel', and, best of all, 'I'm Still Here'. With minimal staging it really is the case that the star is the thing, and her she reigns supreme.\n\nFabulous.",
