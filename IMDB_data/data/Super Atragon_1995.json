How much cooler can you get than a submersible super-battleship with a big drill on the front, except maybe an 80-foot tall steam-powered tarantula?\n\nThe animation was superb, the plot was great, and the action was truly spectacular. I've seen it in both Japanese and English, and as much as I hate dubbing, the dubbed version was actually pretty watchable; plus, how about the musical score, huh? I guess we Poles have something else to contribute after all...\n\nI give Super Atragon an 8 of 10 - a must-see for any fans of Star Blazers/Space Battleship Yamato.\n\nIncidentally, does anybody besides me remember seeing a live-action version of Kaitei Gunkan? It just seems so familiar..."
