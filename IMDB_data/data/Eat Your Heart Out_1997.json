Well, don't bother about the ending because you know it even before you start the movie. However, it's still worth watching because there are some sweet moments inside. The plot is very simple: the guy became famous and neglected the girl, things happened one after another, they got back together, blah, blah, blah. Still it's good to watch this one together with your special someone.",
