She has a funny personality and isn't vain at all. Its funny how people mention that she doesn't take care of herself due to her dressed down clothing and messy up hair, but yet say she's arrogant. Which one is it? Lastly, and most importantly, reviewers are taking this show far too seriously. Its just home videos obviously aired just for fun. Its not a serious documentary. Relax."
