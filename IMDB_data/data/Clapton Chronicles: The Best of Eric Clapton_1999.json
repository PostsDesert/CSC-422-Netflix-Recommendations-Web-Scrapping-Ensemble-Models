        "reviewBody": "Frankly, I expected more. This is a CD with pictures; some live shots from the stage and others that look fairly lame. This DVD does not have the same contents as the eponymous CD! That could cause some confusion. Having seen Clapton in concert in 2001, I can attest to the fact that the DVD sounds pretty much like his concerts (or vice versa).\n\nThe DVD contains 12 songs with a track that shows movie-style scrolling credits. That's it. They could have easily added more information to the DVD. For example, credits (I mean more than the obligatory ones), musicians and intruments used, background material, interviews, etc.\n\nAnother disappointment was that it just has stereo sound. A modern day music DVD must at least have 5.1 surround sound. Just one viewing angle."
