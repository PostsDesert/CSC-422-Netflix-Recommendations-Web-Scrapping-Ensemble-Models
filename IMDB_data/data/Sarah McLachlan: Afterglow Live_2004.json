Warmer, sultrier (is there such a word?), more passionate.\n\nAll the favorites are present, some solo acts, some talent showcases. The crowd is into it, and she feeds on them which makes for a great ambiance.\n\nIt all transpires in her performance, backed by first class sound engineering, camera work and staging.\n\nTruly fine work and a must for any Sarah fan out there!\n\nPS:Turn up the volume cause its all there!",
