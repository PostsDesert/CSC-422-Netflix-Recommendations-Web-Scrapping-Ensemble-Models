Godzilla teams up with King Seesar, a furry guy who likes quiet evenings at home until he is woken up by singing. MechaG is the evil aliens' world conquering device. By the way, the aliens in their true form look like Japanese actors with green ape masks on. Big budget fun. King Seesar is called upon to protect his home Okinawa and make sure Mr.Miyagi's parents survive so he can grow up to teach Daniel-San. All I can say is if this is Okinawa's best defense, that island is screwed. Godzilla eventually beats MechaG by drawing him to his body magnetically (along with some electrical towers) and ripping his head off. Anguirus is in it too, but who cares? Note: this is one of the films where Godzilla squirts blood likes he's in a Peckinpah flick."
