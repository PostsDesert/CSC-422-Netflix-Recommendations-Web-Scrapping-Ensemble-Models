        "reviewBody": "I have to honestly say that this was probably the worst film that I have ever seen in my entire life. I really don't know what was on the producer's, director's, or writer's minds while this piece of garbage was being created.\n\nThe setting centers on five gunslinging, outlaw women (four black, one Asian) in the Old West. This fatuous movie instantly loses all credibility on viewing because of, in addition to lousy acting and a lame story line, its gross historically inaccurate nature. Who ever heard of black outlaw women in the Old West? Did black women really wear hair weaves and extensions during the 1800s? Were idioms like, \"get with him\" and 'Why you gotta be all that?\" used 150 years ago? Yeah, I know it's Hollywood and films are not 100% realistic, but COME ON! \n\nI find it interesting, as well as completely understandable, that every IMDb-user comment pertaining to this movie contends that it is terrible. On the basis of Gang of Roses and Civil Brand, movies that are throwbacks to the Blackexpioltation era, it looks as if Lisa Raye is the Pam Grier of the new millennium."
