        "reviewBody": "rented this cause of the cast. hadn't heard anything about this movie, no wonder why. In a few words, it is awful, the acting is very average, below average i would say, especially if you consider the actors in it,and that is offcource due to the bad script and stupid plot. The story starts with samuel playing cello!! as he is a wannabe musician, and he is also a grand theft cop. the neighbor comes in and convinces him to look for her dissapeared daughter. he has a photo of her and her boyfriend and goes on to look for them on turk street. He ends up in a house where some criminals live and are planing to rob a bank and think that he is after them, while he is not. The robers are an old couple, a psycho guy with bad temper, mila jojovic and tairon, the brain of the operation apparently. The plan they have for robing the bank is verry unconvincing, and thats a very weak part of the movie. The other weak part is the relationships between the characters, which is also silly and unconvincing. There is no chemistry between the characters and the whole story just sucks, the acting and the script doesnt help either. The ending is crap too.\n\nTo sum up, avoid, nothing here to see (except of the breasts of mila jojovic lol!)"
