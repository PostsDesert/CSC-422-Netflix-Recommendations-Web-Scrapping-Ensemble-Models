        "reviewBody": "Brigitte Bardot stars here in her last film along with Jane Birkin, the other singer who recorded the Serge Gainesbourg hit, \"Je t'aime\". This film is worth seeing, as we see BB's and Vadim's evolution from \"And God Created Woman\" to this post-sixties over-the-top comedy-drama.\n\nWe get some great nude scenes with Brigitte and Jane, and BB's character Jeanne is someone fed up with men, so she resorts to seduce and destroy tactics. As in \"And God Created Woman\" she's pretty much playing herself, but with an exaggerated storyline of driving men to ruin, murder, and suicide. The campy ironic humor is there in such scenarios as seducing a priest as well as setting up a fake menage-a-trois to madden a bete homme. Also a scene with Robert Walker Jr. (Charlie X in Star Trek TOS) where the price she asks for making love is no less than his life, which he takes seriously. The ending is a multiple meaning one as BB saves a man who makes her \"pay for her sins\" (though he's unappreciative). I think the end hits home for Brigitte in real life saying in effect, \"look you male-dominated world, you've made my life hell\". And it's the last scene she ever did on film. Worth seeing for it's erotic quality (but what BB film isn't), the submarine home, the early '70s fashions, and the camp."
