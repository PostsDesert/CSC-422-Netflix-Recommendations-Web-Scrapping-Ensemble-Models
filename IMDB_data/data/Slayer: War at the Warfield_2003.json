        "reviewBody": "War at the Warfield is nothing short of awesome. But if it has any drawbacks, it is the absence of original drummer Dave Lombardo. However, Paul Bostaph still did a fine performance on the drums. Tom Araya, Kerry King, and the late Jeff Hanneman were all in great form. \n\nIn addition to performing such Slayer classics as \"Raining Blood\", \"War Ensemble\", \"Dead Skin Mask\", \"South of Heaven\", and \"Angel of Death\", they played some tracks from their then-recent album God Hates Us All, including \"Disciple\" and \"Bloodline\". The December 2001 concert opened with \"Disciple\" and closed with \"Angel of Death\". \n\nWar at the Warfield delivers the goods from start to finish. Evidently, readers of the now-defunct magazine Metal Edge agreed; following its 2003 release, the DVD won a Metal Edge Readers' Choice Award for \"DVD of the Year\" - and rightly so!"
