        "reviewBody": "A group of disaffectionate youths play with a Ouija board, and unleash a murderous Djinn. The plot is used often, but there are plenty of thrills and chills, and the darkness adds to the terror.\n\nMany posters enjoy this film because it is a European horror, but there is absolutely nothing distinguishing this from American horrors, albeit the accents.\n\nThere aren't any clever twists, unless you want to count the ending, but still, that was all too obvious. Lukas Haas, of Witness fame, and Alec Newman(who guest starred on an episode of Tru Calling) where the only recognizable faces in this film.\n\nWhat irks me the most about this film, was that the most attractive cast member, and also one of the more talented, was the first to die. In movies like this, you have to keep the eye candy around for awhile.\n\nFor a superior European horror film, check out Lighthouse with James Purefoy and Rachel Shelley.",
