Great acting, beautiful songs and a story that wants you to sit in eager anticipation and hope that prem succeeds in his quest to gain approval from his would be father-in-law.\n\nAlok Nath plays his role well and so does the young Bagyshree. The only person who I felt played under himself was the character who played Salman Khans Father. M Behl is splendid as the devious villain and it is wonderful to see how flexible he is as a good guy or bad guy.\n\nPhysically speaking there is no magic in the movie but metaphorically speaking this movie is completely divine and full of magic.",
