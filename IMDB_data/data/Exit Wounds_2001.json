Exit wounds does start well with a good fight scene but unfortunately the film lacks pace & too often wonders around going nowhere. IT could certainly have done without tom arnold who turns up as unwanted as a weak bowel. \n\nDMX whoever he is seems comfortable in his role but I never really found out what his operation was. The bad cops in the film were good & there was plenty of decent action with them. \n\nSteven Seagal once again proves himself as a top class actor with those scowls & frowns & that calmness he displays everytime he appears in a scene\n\nNot a bad film but a liitle long"
