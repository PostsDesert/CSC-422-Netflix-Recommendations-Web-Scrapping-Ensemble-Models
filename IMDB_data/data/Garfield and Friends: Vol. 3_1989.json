        "reviewBody": "I definitely remember this cartoon as one of the bests out there along with the Pink Panther. I mean, who could forget those episodes? There was one where Garfield, Jon, and Odie go out to get a car from the high-bargaining, high-convincing salesman Mr. Swindler (It's getting tougher and tougher to make an honest dollar). There was also the one where Garfield wakes up on the wrong cartoon with a He-man/Transformers atmosphere (See them to find out what Gafield does). Otherwise, Garfield is just another world's laziest cat. \n\nThere's also the U.S. Acres (Orson's Farm) segments, based on another strip by Jim Davis preferably for young children (which explains why it aims toward a younger audience). They were great as well, and I liked all the characters (especially Bo and Roy). It was yet another masterpiece in there. And to conclude, there would be a Garfield Quickie based on the comic strips Jim Davis made. I also heard of hidden, or unsyndicated, episodes that never seemed to air on television (but they might appear on the videos/DVDs) All in all, this is most definitely the best cartoon show ever made! Unlike all that violent and vulgar cartoons they're crowding up with nowadays, especially anime, or Japanese animation shows \n\nStill this is my favorite one of cartoons shows in all!!! See if you can find it!"
