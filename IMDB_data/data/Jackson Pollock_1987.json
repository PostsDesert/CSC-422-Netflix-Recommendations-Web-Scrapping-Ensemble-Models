He was the first american avant-garde artist with the same consideration of the critics as the contemporary great masters of Europe. This documentary shows a profile of the painter through the testimonies of the people who knew him and give us real images of his life and Pollock's own works.\n\nJackson Pollock (1912-1956)was a mid-western who got famous in New York and was considered as a model for his contemporaries. He died in a car accident when he was driving completely drunk, but as a character in this documentary says, this fact could be the ending of a long suicide because Pollock was a depressive alcoholic man.",
