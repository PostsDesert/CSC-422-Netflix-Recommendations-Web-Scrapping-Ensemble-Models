It begins like « duel » in a red sand back road in California and the talent and charm of Kim pushes it right away The situation is original and later this unpretentious thriller made in the 80s blossoms : the color, the interior design, the fashion, the cars, well everything is much cooler than our actual standardized 2K society ! Kim is really astounding as she is in every scene and it's one of her earliest movie ! She is definitely among my best actress list and this movie is really an unexpected surprise !",
