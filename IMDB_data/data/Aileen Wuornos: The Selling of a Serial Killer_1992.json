        "reviewBody": "Nick Broomfield, the director of 'Kurt and Courtney', offers another interesting insight to a notorious subject of a different kind. Aileen Wuornos, dubbed America's first female serial killer and a woman who killed seven men, is the topic of Broomfield's investigation. He draws attention to the circumstances surrounding the media and Hollywood deals and the characteristics of Wuornos's lawyer and a Christian woman (who adopts Aileen and becomes her spiritual mother) and exposes their agenda. Rather than give insight to the crimes itself, Broomfield reveals the sensationalism of the event, and the people involved with Aileen. This is hardly a brilliant documentary but essential viewing as we see Broomfield struggle to get his interview with Aileen where the compelling factor revolves around the circumstances of the process and people involved itself! \n\n***1/2 out of *****!",
