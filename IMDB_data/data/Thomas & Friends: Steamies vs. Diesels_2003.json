Everything is made to a great standard of quality, and it offers a sense of originality.\n\nWho would of thought that The Reverend Wilbert Awdry had originally only written these stories as bed time stories for Christopher Awdry, when he was ill. These stories were first written during the 1920's, and when they eventually got published into books, known as The Railway Series, and then onto television.\n\nAlthough not all the stories are based on The Railway Series lately, they still have the same impact.\n\nI think its safe to say that Thomas and his friends will be around for a very long time to come."
