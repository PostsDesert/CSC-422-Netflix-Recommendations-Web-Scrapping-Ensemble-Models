I was impressed with the beauty of the scenery (years later, my wife and I were fortunate enough to visit the Island of Morea) and the soundtrack of the music. I remember, as been very familiar with most of the songs by CSN, that it sounded very different than the original recordings, like the songs were recorder specially for this film. Well, the other day I bought this documentary in order to refresh my memory of it and, again, I was very impressed. I have a question that I hope somebody will be able to answer it, IS THERE A CD WITH THE COMPLETE SOUND TRACK of this film? Thanks",
