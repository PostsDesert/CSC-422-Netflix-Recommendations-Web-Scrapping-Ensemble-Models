Aamir khan who is one of the better actors and Karishma who is easy on the eyes unlike her sister, also happens to be a good actress. There is the usual cast of \"Appetisers-side dishes\" including Johhny lever, who has better talent doing Bhangra than comedy. This actor has talent with mimicry and impersonation but is a annoying comedian. The Story is a typical Bollywood, where the girl meets a poor boy whose habitation almost always happens to be tourist spot that good looking Rich girls happen to visit. They are invariably are snobbish or the Script writers make them that way till the 23rd reel of the movie to make way for the musical numbers-which just happens to be pure treat.",
