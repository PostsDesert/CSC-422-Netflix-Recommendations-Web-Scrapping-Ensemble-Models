        "reviewBody": "When I was first approached to watch this film, I noticed the length and was completely turned away. Ten hours. Who could endure this many interactions with children's storybook characters? Luckily, my wife sat me down and we began this lengthy process. To say the least, I was impressed. Directors David Carson and Herbert Wise did a spectacular job of bringing the magic and detail of fairy tales to the small screen. Through the voyages of our three main heroes, we see so many of our childhood escapes. Places where only our imagination took us before, we are guided through the images of modern television.\n\nImagination is only part of this miraculous tale. This film keeps with the modern idea of fairy tales with some very dark thematic elements. The scenes with the Trolls and with Snow White were spellbinding. You could literally get lost in this film and never want to escape. John Larroquette and Kimberly Williams are decent in their roles (about average for television), but it is Scott Cohen as the Wolf that literally steals every scene. He plays his part to the fullest extent. Ed O'Neill and Rutger Hauer also contribute well to this story. \n\nOverall, this was a beautiful (if long) story that continually pushed the boundaries of a television mini-series. I never knew where it was going to take me next or which fairy tale it would dive right into. There was never a dull moment and it is a story that can be watched over and over again. This is a treat for anyone with a passion for children's literature!\n\nGrade: ***** out of *****"
