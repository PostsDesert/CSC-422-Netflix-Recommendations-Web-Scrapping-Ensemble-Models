Rest assured, the film is bad, but it is a far cry from being one of the worst films ever. The main problem is that the film has no direction. It spends 75 minutes shifting between being a farce and character comedy,failing to be both. In order to function as a character comedy, the lead must be likable, which Pat is anything but. He/she is boorish, rude, insensitive and downright unpleasant. Even if the character is written this way on purpose (which I suspect), there is little else to find interesting, save for a few mediocre jokes, which are not funny enough for this film to function as a farce. That being said, the actors do well with what they are given, but overall the movie's lack in direction or character development and mediocre jokes are its downfall.",
