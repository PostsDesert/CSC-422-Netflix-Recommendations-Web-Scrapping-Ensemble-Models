And Eddie Murphy is his usual annoying self. Plus, they had some ridiculous spy gadgets: an invisible jet; a eye contact that is a camera. It was silly. And the whole double agent plot at the end was just more confusing. I guess it was supposed to be funny, but nothing was funny about this movie.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Don't watch this yet another bad Eddie Murphy movie."
