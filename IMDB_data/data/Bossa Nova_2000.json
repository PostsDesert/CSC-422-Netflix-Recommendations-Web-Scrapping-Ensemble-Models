        "reviewBody": "OK, so the Rio de Janeiro \"Bossa Nova\" shows us is not the real Rio. So the movie has no poor, no hunger, no favelas, no political unrest. Is there a law written somewhere that says films have an obligation to show all of that? No. The people who made \"Bossa Nova\" very self-consciously steered away from the grit to concentrate on the romantic state of mind of the characters, surrounding them with gorgeous locales and a dazzling soundtrack filled with Brazilian classics, which is exactly right for the story. Amy Irving is absolutely enchanting as the protagonist, showing the kind of irresistible innocent charm she exercised in \"Crossing Delancey\" and \"Yentl\". Granted, the film gets a bit silly at times, but if you're willing to suspend your disbelief and go with the flow, buy the coincidences and accept the magic, the final result is a decidedly seductive romantic comedy, the kind they rarely make anymore. I'm a guy and I loved this movie, and I'll bet money there isn't a woman out there who won't like it at least as much as I did. Personally, I saw this on a studio-released tape before it opened in theaters and will pay to see it again on the big screen to take in the gorgeous widescreen cinematography and the fabulous music as they were meant to be experienced."
