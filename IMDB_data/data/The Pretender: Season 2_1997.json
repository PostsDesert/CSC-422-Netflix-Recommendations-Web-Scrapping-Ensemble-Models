        "reviewBody": "The graphics, voice acting, character development, and sound are spot on. This is expected given the success of the first and increased budget.\n\nThe failing of this game is pacing and writing. Falling down or jump scares are cheap plot devices sprinkled throughout your gaming experience. Instead of just telling a good story you're forced into nonsense \"action\" sequences that are so clunky and poorly made it would make even Ubisoft cringe.\n\nThis is all in stark contrast to the first game. Which had clear cut game mechanics that were easy to understand and well explained when they weren't. You can really tell the devs dropped the ball on this one for the sake of cash grabbing.\n\nEdit: Had to come back and really hammer home the poor mechanics. From one QuickTime cut scene to another the problem persists. They can't make the mechanics clear or change them so dramatically that you have to replay the same scene over and over.\n\nPoorly made game. Devs should be ashamed of themselves for yet another abortion of a once great franchise.",
