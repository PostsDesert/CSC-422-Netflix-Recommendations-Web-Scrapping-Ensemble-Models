After watching this DVD you just wish you lived in Cat Stevens' generation. This DVD gets a 10 from me. It contains many extras like a interview with Yusuf Islam. Before seeing this DVD I always just listened to Cat Stevens and I saw some pictures of him when he was Cat Stevens. But I never saw him perform. So I just wondered how it would like be to see him perform. And I can tell you it is just beautiful! He is the kind of singer like Bob Marley. Those guys love making music. When they sing they are in a trance. And you can see this on the Majikat DVD.",
