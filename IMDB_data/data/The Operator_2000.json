When I saw this movie, I got a warm feeling inside!! This is how the operators feel when we get abused by customers. I don't like violent movies, but this one was done with good taste, and I would have loved to be in that operator's place. Next time you decide to get abusive to a customer service rep, please watch this movie!! I watch it every time I have a bad day and it instantly makes me feel better! As for the content of the movie, everything was very well done. I never felt any sorrow for the caller, and felt that the operator was justified in everything she did.",
