The accent and attempt to sound more \"manly\" is embarrassing. He's trying so hard that it is over shadowing any chemistry he could have had with Brittany Snow. Even his interactions with the dog are awkward and forced. I don't know if I can actually finish this movie. Its only saving grace is the side characters. I like the mom and Joanna Swisher. I actually really like all these actors which is why it's so disappointing that this movie isn't good.",
