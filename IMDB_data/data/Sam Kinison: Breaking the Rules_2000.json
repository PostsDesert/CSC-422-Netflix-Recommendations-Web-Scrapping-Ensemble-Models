Also included are two of Kinison's finest bits, both funny and, indeed, smart- the first is his teaching about how to make the woman you love or want to love happy (a.k.a. 'the alphabet'). The second is a bit on a news story where some men were let into a morgue, and something, err, unpleasant occurred. So, sit back, maybe crack open a beer, and learn why Kinison is still mentioned as being one of the most influential, true, and outrageous comedians from the 80's and early 90's. A"
