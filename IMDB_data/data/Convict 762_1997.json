The girls crash land on a planet devoid of sunlight in a spacecraft devoid of light bulbs. The gloomy set only compliments the dismal cinematography. (If using ultra low light is a gimmick for obscuring a low budget, it doesn't work). The girls are photographed mainly from the chin up. You probably won't feel cheated or teased by this, however, since their wardrobes are as enticing as potato sacks. The sparse action provided is also undermined by the lack of light and cramped cinematography. I sometimes wonder how those stupid enough to produce these unappealing gems are smart enough to get the money in the first place. The producers wasted their time and money. Don't waste yours.",
