        "reviewBody": "This third installment, and the second one I have seen presents a more interesting story, and more action.\n\nAfter her latest hit, Rei, Zero Woman (Kumiko Takeda) walks away. She beds a hit-man (Keiji Matsuda as Katumura) sent to kill her that she picks up in a bar, presumably to fight her depression. This is apparently related to deaths that have occurred in the past, as there are several flashbacks to her childhood.\n\nBut, despite her boss's pleas for her to come back to work and kill the remaining four targets, she appears to attempt suicide by walking into a bar full of mobsters and purposely setting herself up. Katsumura, who has demons of his own, saves her instead of killing her.\n\nNaturally, this irritates his bosses, and when Zero Woman returns to duty, they kidnap his girlfriend (Mari Nishina) to make him finish the job.\n\nLots of action as Zero Woman and Katsumura zero in on the remaining thugs. But, I sure didn't see the ending in the bowling alley coming.\n\nWhether she is seating in the sauna or on top of Katsumura, Zero Woman is a joy to watch - and Marie Jinno wasn't bad either!",
