Sam sure was handsome when he was younger (still looks good now too, though).\n\nIn the end I didn't get the main character because her behavior didn't make a lot of sense to me. If Sam Neill's character was an idiot I would understand, but he was about as perfect for Davis' character as she could ever hope for & her \"career\" didn't seem like much of a lifestyle......so her actions left me perplexed.\n\nStill, the movie was well done & the scenery was interesting. It kept me engaged until the end....however, when the final credits rolled I was left scratching my head.",
