        "reviewBody": "Josh Brolin from The Goonies makes a great skateboarding hero. This movie is filled with great styles and great fads from the time period, not to mention great music, including The Circle Jerks and The Red Hot Chili Peppers who perform in the movie. It's a classic story of good guy falls for bad guy's sister. Bad guy and good guy fight, and finally bad guy and good guy unite after good guy beats bad guy in a skateboarding race. This movie seems very comical watching it in present day, but it actually serves as a time capsule for the 80's. There are many great skateboarding tricks displayed, and many other great scenes including: a skateboarder riding into the side of a truck, and watch carefully (and rewind to watch over and over again) the hilarious scene where the young kid in the sunglasses shouts out \"NO, you be there!\", pure genious.",
