        "reviewBody": "This is a delightful little movie by Andrew Bergman, the director of \"The In-Laws\". It features among other things Marlon Brando doing an incredibly funny take-off on his own performance in \"The Godfather\". Brando and Broderick play off each other beautifully and Penelope Anne Miller is equally wonderful as Brando's sexy daughter. Despite the fact that this movie is largely farce, the direction and acting give the characters a depth that you wouldn't expect. Full of surprises and off-beat touches. The one minor flaw is the performance of a Komodo dragon that looks suspiciously like a Monitor lizard - OK, is a Monitor Lizard.",
