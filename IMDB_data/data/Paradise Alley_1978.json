        "reviewBody": "If this film had been spoken in Italian and dubbed in English (like all Italian movies of the seventies) it would have scooped all of the European arthouse awards. It is an excellent film that I have watched many times, and one which always reminds me to respect Stallone as a serious and talented writer/director. This film is very funny and very engaging and can hold it's own with classics of the time such as Lina Wertmuller's \"Seven Beauties\" or Lasse Hallstrom's \"My Life As A Dog\". It's a shame that Stallone has never equalled this work. First Blood had much to recommend it and can even stand a little analysis as a metaphor for the American Post-Vietnam psyche. Cliffhanger is pure 'leave-your brain-at-the-door' entertainment and Stallone is perfect in the part but he has done nothing (including Copland) that approaches the sheer art of Paradise Alley. I give it nine out of ten"
