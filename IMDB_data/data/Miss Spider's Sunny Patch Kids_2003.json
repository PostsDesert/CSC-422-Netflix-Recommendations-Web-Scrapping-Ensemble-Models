        "reviewBody": "this cartoon is by far better than any of the fake filler fluff Disney puts out, well written moral based lessons on life brought together by very good voice actors , i had no idea brooke shields was the mom spider ! very high end production values from the smooth animation to original songs, this is not scary for kids good grief , what kind of namby pamby wussy kids are being raised out there geesh !! there is one bug called bounce who isn't a bug but some kind of bouncing blueberry thing who is fun to watch none the less, this is what Saturday morning shows need to be, smart and legitimate not dumb and commercialized (disney) ---------------Todd",
