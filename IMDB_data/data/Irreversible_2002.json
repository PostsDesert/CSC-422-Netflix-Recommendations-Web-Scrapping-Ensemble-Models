        "reviewBody": "A lot has been said about this movie. Yes, there are a couple of brutal and violent scenes. It's even hard to watch at times, but Irreversible is much more than that.\n\nI personally think that the acting is great. There's a natural chemistry between the 3 main characters. Monica Bellucci does a wonderful job as Alex. I give her a lot credit for being involved in such difficult role.\n\nI really like the way the story was told. Some people say that it's a rip off of Memento, and that it doesn't work well in this movie, but I have to disagree. The movie \"starts\" in a dark way, with a lot of graphic images and violence. But at the end there's this kind of peace, a little dose of happiness...\"the calm before the storm\". It works really well, and that's what make this a really sad story.\n\nI really recommend this film. But like I said before, it can be hard to watch. Just watch it with an open mind and give it a try.",
