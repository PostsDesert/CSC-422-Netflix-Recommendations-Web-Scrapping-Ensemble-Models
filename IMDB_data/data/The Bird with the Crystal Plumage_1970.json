This tense film is about a american who's caught up in a mysterious murder case. He decides to play Sherlock Holmes and find out who did it. A cool soundtrack, nifty direction and camera work makes this one and interesting watch. Recommended for Giallo fans and admirers of Dario Argento.\n\nA\n\nP.S. Watch out for people in brown raincoats who are armed with shiny cutlery!",
