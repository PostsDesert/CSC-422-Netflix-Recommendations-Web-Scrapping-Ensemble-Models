For the price, it could have been done at high-res or SP.\n\nSome special effects are used, but they are definitely of the high school hacker variety.\n\nEven Asimov is blurry in this movie.\n\nEverything is blurry in this movie.\n\nThe Mercury and Venus footage is made-up and quite hokey.\n\nThe Jupiter footage is the best part of this movie, looking almost real.\n\nThere is nothing more worth saying.",
