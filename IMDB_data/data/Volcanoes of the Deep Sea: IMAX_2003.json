        "reviewBody": "The only reason I didn't give this video 10 stars is because the audio could be a little louder. This is a modern day mystery about a fossil imprint made by an organism on the seafloor near the hydrothermal vents that apparently still exists, and continues to make these imprints even today - Paleodictyon. The images are awe-inspiring, the ecosystem is fascinating, the Alvin (the deep sea submersible) is incredible. And BTW, in response to another reviewer's comments - animated sequences are common in these science documentaries, and I'm pretty sure the scientists' smiling faces are not fake or acting, since every time they go down there, they discover a half dozen new species. Peter Rona, Rich Lutz, etc are like our modern day Magellan and Columbus they are a privileged few (like the astronauts) that get to see, first hand, things that no living person has ever witnessed before. I show this film in my high school Marine Biology class each semester, and the kids watch with jaws dropped. I have met both Peter Rona and Rich Lutz and I know these guys bleed deep blue (sea), they couldn't be more authentic. If you've always wanted to go on a deep sea expedition, this is your last chance!!!",
