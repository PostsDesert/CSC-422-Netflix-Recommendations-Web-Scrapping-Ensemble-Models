Not to mention, Mr. Phoenix's screen presence is incredible. In fact, I could've followed him around the whole night. Furthermore, there is a great amount of foreshadowing on and off the screen. When Eddie (Phoenix) discusses Vietnam, he mentions its a small mess and that he'll be back in a few months. We, however, know that a different course lies ahead. In addition, this is one of Mr. Phoenix's final films, a glimpse of a magnificent only two years before his tragic demise. As a result, actor-character parallel almost each other, which I found to be truly sad. In addition, I give my credits to Bob and Nancy for executing a perfect ending. Yet, for me, this picture will always be a testament to one of the finest actors of our generation; may his spirit live on.\n\nTed's Grade: A-"
