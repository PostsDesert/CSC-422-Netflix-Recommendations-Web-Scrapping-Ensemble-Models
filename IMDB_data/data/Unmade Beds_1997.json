        "reviewBody": "Unmade Beds (1997) was written and directed by Nicholas Barker. The basic concept of the film is interesting--find four unmarried New Yorkers, and follow their lives for nine months. All of them want to get married, or to form some lasting relationship, but none of them is succeeding. \n\nThe problem with the movie is that all four of the people aren't really people you would want to know, let alone love. One man is arrogant--he won't date \"mutts,\" although he certainly isn't a perfect 10. One man is 5 feet 4 inches tall, and that's a problem in our society. However, he doesn't do much to make himself interesting in a way that would attract women. \n\nOne woman is narcissistic. She calls herself \"The Sexy Italian.\" She has no problem demonstrating to us what she considers the outstanding and also the problem parts of her body. She's a chronic shoplifter, and does drugs. Her goal is to enter a relationship in which she trades her body for money.\n\nOne woman is whiny. She's very overweight, but when her friend suggests that she try to lose weight, she almost bites her head off. (In fact, the friend is the only person on screen towards whom I could feel any warmth.)\n\nOnly 20 years have passed since the film was made, but, in the context of searching for a partner, our society has changed quite a bit. That's especially true about dating ads. In 1997, the basic wide search for a mate took place in the personal ad columns of newspapers and magazines. Computer dating services existed, but they appeared pretty primitive compared to what we have today. \n\nA dating coach tells one of the men to buy a dog, because dogs are \"people magnets.\" OK, but once the magnet has worked, where do you go from there when you have no personality?\n\nIf the four people had something attractive about them, we could feel sorry for their lack of partners. However, this film gives us no one to care about. What's the point of a voyeuristic movie if there's really nothing to see?\n\nWe saw this film on the small screen, and it worked well. I'm surprised that it has a respectable 6.9 IMDb rating. I think it's a terrible movie, and can't recommend it.",
