        "reviewBody": "It starts off as a comedy, then it becomes a crime comedy, before turning into a romantic crime comedy. If you liked Bandits or Birthday girl, Kill me later is another film I'd recommend, even though it is probably harder to find. Actually, I could recommend the film to any one who is in the mood for some light entertainment without too much sex or violence, but one that is not too sissy or sappy either. It's not great, but it is definitely likable.\n\nLife isn't going so good for loan officer Shawn Holloway. On the day she decides to jump off the roof of her bank building, there is a robbery that goes south, thirty floors below her. One of thee robbers escapes, and takes Shawn hostage. She agrees to cooperate if he kills her once they are in the clear. that idea doesn't go so well either, because he is (for lack of a better clich√©) chicken. Thus the two continue their run from the law, and on the way, Shawn starts to fall for this quirky robber.\n\nAlthough the story isn't super extensive and its dimensions are of middling depth and detail, it gets you going, and you sort of end up caring. Selma Blair is not much of an actress at all, and much of her work is torpid, but this is a fairly good role for her as an average American emo, who starts to get something out of life when a few cute story contrivances come her way and take her on a crazy journey.\n\nLike all films (even great ones) there is room for improvement, in Kill me Later, but the film is strait forward, to the point, and cute/quirky enough to be worth a watch, if by chance this relatively unknown feature finds its way into your life.",
