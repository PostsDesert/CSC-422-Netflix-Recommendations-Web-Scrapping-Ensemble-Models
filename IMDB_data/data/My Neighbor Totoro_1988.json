Suddenly, he stops at My Neighbor Totoro and smiles. Well, that's a pretty typical happenning around the house here.\n\nMiyazaki created a true masterpiece with this film. It has everything a person, of any age, could want. There are points that it is hilarious, a few points where it makes one slightly nervous, the animation is outstanding (as with all Miyazaki films), and aside from lacking a little bit in plot (what movie doesn't nowadays?), the story is wonderful.\n\nOne of the things that makes this film shine, at least for me, is that there is absolutely no antagonist role. No bad guy whatsoever, and only a genius like Miyazaki could pull that off.\n\nIs this a childrens movie? Yes, of course it is. Is it a movie only for children? Well... maybe for the inner child inside all of us. There's humour in this movie that the young will laugh at, and there's a bit of humour in the movie that only adults will fully catch and appreciate, without it being \"adult humour\".\n\nI would reccommend, and have reccommended this film to anyone that would listen.\n\nThank you again Miyazaki Sensei.",
