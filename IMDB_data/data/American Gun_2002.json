He was awesome in Affliction and no less awesome in\n\nAmerican Gun. This story is very inventive in its telling. It utilizes the device of\n\nflashback better than any film in recent memory. It has also,\n\nthrough its multiple story line, enabled to include in its cast a\n\nvariety of minoroty actors and strong female roles. The issues that\n\nare tackled are well examined. War, male rites of passage,\n\nfather/daughter, parent/child relationships, faith and forgiveness to\n\nname a few. And it manages to not give away its ending. I highly\n\nreccomend this film."
