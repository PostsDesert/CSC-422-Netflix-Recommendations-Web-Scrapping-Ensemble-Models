In episode 5, his witness \"hangs himself\" while in custody, and when he's told he shakes his head up and down while having a dumb look on his face! That's just one of many horrible pieces of acting!\n\nThe stories are poorly written, and the character played by Jeff Donovan is just unlikable, and I'm a big fan of his and his starring role in Burn Notice.\n\nI'm HOPING that they get better writers and recast Hugh Dancy. This show has a proud history. It deserves better treatment!",
