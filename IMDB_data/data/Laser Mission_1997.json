        "reviewBody": "Michael Gold (Brandon Lee) is a mercenary hired by the CIA to find a German scientist (Ernest Borgnine). The scientist has developed a laser technology that everyone wants. After their rendezvous on the beach, both Brandon and Borgnine are captured. This sets up the daring escape by Brandon, after which he volunteers to go back and find the professor.\n\nThis movie is classically bad. It seems to take place in Africa, with Soviet, Cuban and German soldiers involved. Debi Monahan rounds up the cast as the professor's daughter. She is thoroughly annoying in this role, as her voice seems to increase in pitch as she gets louder and is also very whiny. The only redeeming qualities of her character is her push up blue dress, which seems to be the only thing she wears during the movie (she does wear a white jump suit at the beginning and a bed sheet after the \"sex\" scene).\n\nBrandon Lee is suppose to be the star of this movie, however, he comes off quite flat. Its not just the acting thats bad but also the action. I haven't seen so many drop-kicks since Star Trek : The Original Series. He also tries to emulate his father by doing \"characterizations\" (see Chinese Connection). The slapping Manuel sketch is a good indicator how bad his acting is. It is funny though. He also seems to pull off an Arab beggar.\n\nTo complement Brandon (other than Debi Monahan), we get Mr. Borgnine (whom we see actually sleeping during a scene), a crazy Soviet Colonel (who refuses to die), a white big game hunter and a pair of bungling Cuban soldiers (a female Sergeant and the beloved Manuel).\n\nNothing sums up this movie more completely than the \"theme song\" of the movie (Mercenary Man), which seems to be playing in either muzak form or the 80's bad rock form and the dialog.\n\nDialog such as : \n\n(Brandon) I did my job. Pay me and let me get the hell outta here.\n\n(CIA suit) Kiss ... my ... ass !!! \n\n(Brandon) NO !\n\nThis movie was definitely worth the $4 I spent on it. RIP Brandon.\n\n-Celluloid Rehab",
