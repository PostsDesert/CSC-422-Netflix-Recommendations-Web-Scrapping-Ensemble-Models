        "reviewBody": "People who say this movie is long and boring have obviously never sat through, oh, \"Lawrence of Arabia,\" \"Patton,\" \"Doctor Zhivago,\" \"The Godfather,\" \"Ran,\" \"Seven Samurai,\" or probably even \"Braveheart.\" Thank God that not every filmmaker believes that a car must explode every 10 seconds in order for his movie to be a success. Kevin Costner is one of those directors who prefers the long format. David Lean, Francis Coppola and Mel Gibson, to name a very few, also worked in that format, and produced lasting works of art that also packed theaters. There are plenty of options for people who don't like movies that take the time to build character, drama and suspense, movies like \"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,\" \"Freddy Vs. Jason,\" and \"Weekend at Bernie's.\" I don't think any of those movies has ever been called \"boring,\" but they sure are crap cinema.\n\nOnward. \"Dances With Wolves\" thrilled audiences way back in 1990 and made so darn much money precisely because people had forgotten the pleasures of the long narrative, the Western genre, and movies that weren't special effects schlock-fests. It remains an inspiring and moving experience, especially on DVD, which preserves the movie's theatrical sound and picture quality.\n\nCostner's direction is first-rate. He's able to blend intimate drama with big, sprawling action that covers a huge canvas. I'm amazed at how smoothly the film segues from movement to movement -- action, alienation, suspense, social commentary, romance. Heck, Spielberg could take a lesson or two from this movie.\n\nHe also gets great performances out of his cast. I don't think of these people as actors, but as the characters they play. That's a compliment not just to the actors themselves, but their director. And, yes, Costner is terrific as John Dunbar.\n\nSure, it's easy to call \"Dances\" politically correct w/ reference to the Indians. But it also treats them as people and, better yet, as fictional characters whose lives are made part of a fascinating narrative. I just consider all the complaints about the politics of this movie as total hogwash.\n\nFinally, the movie is beautifully shot, has an unforgettable score, and is very well-written. I've never thought of \"Dances\" as a Western, but a modern action picture/character study that avoids all the boring cliches of the Western genre. Here is a movie that stands for something, means something, and deserves at least as much respect as some of the overrated dreck we've gotten saddled with lately.",
