I think to really understand the news footage and the bands interview you would have to have some education on the band and the sixties. I am a follower of the band and anything that i come across the has to do with the Doors i usually have to pick up. If you enjoy this movie i would recommend buying the albums and reading up on the bands history they were all rather unique individuals. This movie helps bring the sixties alive to my generation. From me to you enjoy the music and get lost in its words.Is will open up the doors for a new horizon of classic rock music for future generations.",
