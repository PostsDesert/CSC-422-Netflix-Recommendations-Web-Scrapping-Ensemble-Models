        "reviewBody": "This is not a documentary, sorry for Nick Morris! Even he did a great job filming it! \n\nIf not really a documentary, in the meaning of that word, it is more... \n\nTo describe what these performers-monks do with their body and Shaolin Wu Shu is a waist of time... \n\nYou must see that show at any cost!\n\nBut, you folks, you like guns and blood or anything of this kind, you'll be strongly disappointed... The ones who died, are killed in a way you don't fear for them, you know it's a harmless drama ! Me? I like that way...\n\nThe show of the Shaolin Monks is in the perfect spirit of Martial Arts... with the deep understanding of what they are... and what only they should be :\n\nNot for fighting, but for increasing the inner spirit, and the body abilities and technical skills... the fights are just the side aspects of the practice, for checking the efficiency! \n\nAbout the show itself, al contrario to the other reviewers, for me, everything is just perfect! Music doesn't prevail the action, and yes, with their weapons too, they are not only good, the are fantastically hot!\n\nEven in a different optic, it has the same quality as Alegria's Cirque du Soleil, it is just amazing and incredible... \n\nIt doesn't make you smile, no, but most of the time you could stay mouth opened... saying wow!!! and personally, considering myself as a very demanding critic, it is seldom and difficult to bring me in that state of mind... \n\nI like, generally speaking, martial arts quality movies... this one is not a movie, but mainly a full acrobatic martial art show! Yes, the simple plot has definitively no importance... because the action play and the technical skill is too superb...\n\nBy chance, this show \"falled in my hand\" .... astonished and very glad, I told myself not to be lazy and comment it... so, if this review may help to look at \"Shaolin Wheel of Life\", I'm glad having taken time to write this down... Otherwise... sorry for you, not for me, I'm still enchanted...",
