Well, she is so real and struggling in this one that you just gotta give it to her. She's still beautiful even when portraying desperation. The bonding between her, Lau Ching-Wan and the little boy captures the essence of a family coming together after falling apart from previous ties. Painful to watch at times but well worth it in the end. Is that her singing during the credits?\n\nLau-Ching Wan comes across so noble in this one as he just can't resist the urge to be the hero coming to the rescue and really melting away the past. You're rooting for him so strong to get the girl and he just makes such the wonderful dad/problem solver. Excellent performances by the leads."
