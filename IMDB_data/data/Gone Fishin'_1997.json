Gone Fishin' is a hilarious movie that showcases both actors at their best. Danny Glover hasn't been so good since his last movie and won't be again until his next movie. Glover is truly one of Hollywood's greatest actors. Joe Pesci makes a big comeback after the terrible \"8 Heads in a Duffelbag\". This movie has non-stop laughs. I highly recommend this movie. I give it a 10! 10+! Boderline Living!"
