There's something about the primitiveness of the animation and the bizarre things that happen in these old cartoons that just fascinates me, somewhat like the Fleischer cartoons with Betty Boop. There is some racy material in here as Flip peeks through a keyhole to look at a nude woman just out of the shower and an angel on a cloud giving an airplane the middle finger! There's a section called THINGS THAT GO BUMP IN THE NIGHT with weird & scary cartoons sure to give impressionable youngsters nightmares for weeks.",
