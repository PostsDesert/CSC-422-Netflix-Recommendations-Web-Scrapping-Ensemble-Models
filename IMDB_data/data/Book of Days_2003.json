        "reviewBody": "Featuring great actors in this melodrama that lacks substance and credibility, this predictable story centers around loss and love. Jonah (Hayes) delivers a book with everyone's death date to a young man who recently losses his wife, played by Wil Wheaton, and discovers he can save people from dying by interfering with their lives but is subject to losing years off his own in the process. In between these events, Frankie falls in love with Danny and a co-worker discovers his plan of offering life insurance to people who are about to die and believes he is murdering them. Strong performances by both Wil Wheaton and Deborah Raffin who plays Danny's mother-lawyer. Maureen Flannigan and Issac Hayes do a decent job while Richard Grieco is laughable. This uneven movie is strained by the story and the situations with its characters and supporting cast. The one entity that helps this film be watchable is its lead actor who portrays Danny as someone to care about.",
