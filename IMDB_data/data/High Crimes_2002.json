        "reviewBody": "Claire Kubrik (Ashley Judd) is an attorney whose relationship with her husband Tom (Jim Caviezel) is turned on its head. Tom is arrested for the murder of innocent civilians during a covert army operation 15 years earlier. Claire has been kept in the dark about her husbands past, but despite her doubts she still believes his innocence and takes it upon herself to act as his defence attorney with the help of a disgraced military lawyer (Morgan Freeman) \n\nThe film is both suspenseful and intriguing, with very fine performance from all the cast. Most of the film is quite interesting and even compelling at times, as the mystery builds and then as it begins to unravel. The surprise ending however, lets the movie down; when with more attention to detail it could have been quite impressive and really could have made the movie.\n\nBy the end you are left feeling a bit unfulfilled, mainly due to all the smoke and mirrors used to make the ending a shock.\n\n6/10 should have been better, but it's watchable",
