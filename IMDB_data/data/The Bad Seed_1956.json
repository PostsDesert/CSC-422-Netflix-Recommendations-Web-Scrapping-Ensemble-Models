        "reviewBody": "I love this movie. I have read many reviews from professionals and they all seem to think the movie is too theatrical and you can tell it was a stage play and that the mother is especially dramatic. She is, that's true, but in the same way Faye Dunaway chews up Mommie Dearest and we all know what a hoot that is. Little Rhoda is a real stinker. The handyman had better \"give her those shoes.\" The subplot of the mother's own identity is fun too. All in all, the movie is very 50s. You can almost see Wally and the Beaver coming down the street. Great! There is also some discussion about the formal introduction of the cast at the end which I've always found a very nice touch. Much older films of the 30s used to do that all the time. It's been said this film did it to show the characters were just flesh and blood actors and so their roles and the subject matter (especially Patty McCormack) shouldn't be taken seriously. See it. By the way, there is one review on this site by someone who says they saw the movie at age 12 that is very negative. Don't believe it!"
