        "reviewBody": "This is supposed to be a classic, but I don't buy it. It's good in a lot of ways; good acting, good shooting/editing. But the script has weaknesses that sort of bring it down as a \"great\" film. I would have liked to see more psychological tension built up via better-developed confrontation between the leading characters which would have highlit Close's state of denial in a more believable and frightening way. You can't make up for a lack of well-scripted situational tension with clever acting, camera angles, and editing. Flaws in the script are the weak link that stops Fatal Attraction from being great...too bad!\n\nHowever, I will laud all the acting. A lot of people on this board are pooh-poohing Close's efficacy as a believable target for a bout of hot sex.\n\nI thought her character was very well done: Let's face it, Close *is* a genuine talent. I guess people will continue to watch this movie for the sex scenes, which *are* noteworthy for their playfulness. However, I have to warn you that if you take narrative integrity seriously, you'll be a little disappointed.\n\nADDENDUM: This flick is also referenced very interestingly in Bob Altman's \"The Player\". According to one studio exec character in \"Player\", the ending to Fatal Attraction was rewritten and reshot after the first cut was shown to a test audience. Now, I don't know if that's true or not, but it does make you wonder. Does the strange chaotic ending really reflect an attempt to stitch on a more popular ending without thought to overall purpose or narrative integrity? -raz"
