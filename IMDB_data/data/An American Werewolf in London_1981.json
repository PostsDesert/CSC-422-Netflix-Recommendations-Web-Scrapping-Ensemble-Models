        "reviewBody": "Interestingly enough then the 1981 horror movie \"An American Werewolf in London\" still is one of the most iconic werewolf movies out there and has been so for 41 years. That is some impressive feat, I have to admit that.\n\nI had the opportunity to sit down and watch writer and director John Landis' 1981 movie again here in 2022, and of course I needed no persuasion to do so, because \"An American Werewolf in London\" truly is a horror classic. And I find that the movie is every bit as entertaining and enjoyable as it was back in the day when watching it as a kid.\n\nThe storyline is pretty straight forward, and it is actually rather enjoyable, despite being somewhat generic. But take into consideration that this movie was made in 1981, so it was somewhat pushing boundaries back in the day.\n\nThe visual effects were great back in the day. And I will actually go as far as saying that they still hold up now 41 years later. Sure, there are signs of aging, but having just seen the movie again, I still find the special effects in the movie rather enjoyable and good. Especially the transformation scenes, they are just spectacular and very, very impressive for a movie 41 years old.\n\nThe cast in the movie is good, and I've always liked David Naughton in this movie. But the movie also have familiar faces on the cast list such as Jenny Agutter, Frank Oz and even a short appearance by Rik Mayall.\n\nIf you enjoy werewolf movies, then you should be well-familiar with \"An American Werewolf in London\" already, and if you are not familiar with this 1981 classic, then you should make haste and acquire a copy and sit down to watch John Landis' masterpiece.\n\nMy rating of \"An American Werewolf in London\" lands on a well-deserved eight out of ten stars. This is a classic werewolf movie, and it is one that can be watched over and over.",
