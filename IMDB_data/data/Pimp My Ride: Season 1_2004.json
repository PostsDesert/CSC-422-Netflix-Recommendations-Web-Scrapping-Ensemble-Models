The most interesting episodes deal with musical themed cars. Plus, the cars look so bad, that any change (extreme or not) is welcome. The show has had a few slam dunks. One episode where they \"pimped\" a volkswagon wagon was pretty cool. They seem to have more success with larger cars, because it gives them more room to play with. There were a few episodes where I was a little jealous, because the interior furniture was uniquely nice and the paint job was fantastic. It is fun to watch, although sometimes certain auto techs get a little silly and lampoonish. And that can get annoying. One thing is clear, this show is all about fun. But, overall, It is worth checking out once in a while.",
