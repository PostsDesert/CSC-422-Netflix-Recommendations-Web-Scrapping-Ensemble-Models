        "reviewBody": "I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs. Found it to be a lil dull then but after revisiting few days back I found it to b a very different take on the wolf genre with theme of ecological imbalances n deforestation. The movie suffered cos it released in the same year as The Howling and An American Werewolf in London. While the latter two became very famous werewolves flicks, Wolfen became an obscured one. Wolfen also lacked the transformation scenes. The plot - A rich man, his wife n their tall n heavy built chauffeur r killed in a gruesome manner. The driver has his hand severed before he can shoot. A burnt out detective (Albert Finney) is called in to investigate along with a female reporter. Forensic evidence points towards wolf species but authorities r suspicious with a terrorist organisation n our detective gets curious with Native American theories on shapeshifting creatures. The director being a cinematographer, some scenes r shown thru the pov of the creatures with mounting tension. There is a very lousy voyeuristic sex scene again thru the pov of the creatures. The film does get a lil tensed towards the ending with the revelations n a decapitation scene.",
