        "reviewBody": "The ultimate Gary Oldman Film Noir! If you want to see a great thriller that makes you sit on the edge of your seat with out being overly gory, check this movie out!\n\nBig city cop in \"It\", up to here! Great story and cinematography! Excellent soundtrack, and the weirdest cop story I've ever seen. I have seen it, I don't know how many times, but I never tire of it.\n\nEveryone does a fine job of acting and Lena Olin is one of the most lethal women in a movie I've ever seen. She should been cast as a killer in a \"Bond\" film by now.\n\nOldman is great with his New York accent, and makes you feel the pain he feels when he loses a toe, or should I say, when it's taken from him. I won't say how, but he's got some bad friends in low places.\n\nIt's a love story that gets all f***ed up. But what an incredible ride through the film. He's up and when he comes down, it's crash and burn all over the place.\n\nRent it, buy it, just see it. The DVD is here finally, wish there was a commentary on it, but that's how it goes. Ciao 4 now xoxox"
