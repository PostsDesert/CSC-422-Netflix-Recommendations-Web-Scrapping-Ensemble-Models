The entire experience is totally gripping and overwhelmingly powerful. Various camera shots remind me of the great Eisenstein films. This is the first film I've seen of Khalid Muhamed. His genius is staggering. I then viewed Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai and am dumfounded that it swept so many (any??) awards! It is like a shallow cartoon when compared with Fiza. It boggles my mind that Kaho could have won awards in any category where it might compete with Fiza. This is the best film I have seen in a LONG time. Must see. Don't miss it! Buy it! Watch it over and over......it is a true work of art and devotion. How786",
