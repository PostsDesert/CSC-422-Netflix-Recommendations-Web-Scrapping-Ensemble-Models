        "reviewBody": "It's hard to know where to begin here. It's basically a documentary of the Drag festival Wigstock. These kinds of documentaries are great in that they give people in Middle America a look into a world they would probably never otherwise see. Being that this is a drag show, you will of course see fabulous costumes, fabulous hair, fabulous attitude and fabulous song numbers. It's all a world where people are caught up in in visions of their own absolute fabulousness. In scenes where you see several people living together and getting dressed for their performances, you wonder how such larger than life personalities could stand to share the same room.\n\nGreat performances here. Lypsinka is great as always and here on this movie you will have your only chance to see a Drag Queen give birth on stage. Recommended only if you are not uptight."
