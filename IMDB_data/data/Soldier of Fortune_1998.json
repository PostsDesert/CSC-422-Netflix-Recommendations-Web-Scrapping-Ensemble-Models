As Hank Lee, Gable has many connections in Hong Kong, and mainland China during the 50's. Susan Hayward has learned of her husband's capture on trumped-up charges from the Chinese gov't, and is willing to use any means possible to rescue him. This means even recruiting the mysterious Hank Lee, a rogue, a bandit, a smuggler, and those are his good qualities, according to the British crown, represented by Michael Rennie.\n\nWhen all is said and done, Gable finally accepts the challenge, and how he pulls the rescue off makes the story. Downtown Hong Kong has many memorable shots, and the film utilizes each of them to the fullest potential.",
