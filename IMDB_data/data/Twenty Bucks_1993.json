        "reviewBody": "This movie was everything I thought it would be and wasn't-- all at the same time. Like the plot says it's a movie about the life of a twenty dollar bill and how it is woven amongst the lives of everyday people, but the movie presented this in a very interesting way. The bill does go around but we see it come back around and almost make it back to a few who once had possession of it. This makes the journey of the bill much more intriguing. Strong acting does this movie well too. My favorite scene was easily with Christopher Lloyd and Steve Buscemi as two crooks. Elizabeth Shue and Brendan Fraser's stories are sad, but we can relate to them as normal people. It is interesting how the director shows so much of each character's personality and background with so little screen time. Throughout the entire film, there are recognizable faces and none of them disappoint. Watch out for a enjoyable cameo by Jeremy Piven too. Two thumbs up for the director for reviving an old script.",
