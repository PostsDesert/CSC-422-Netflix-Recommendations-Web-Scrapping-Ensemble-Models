        "reviewBody": "I had not previously seen any films with Adrienne Shelly that were not tied to writer/director Hal Hartley. With Hartley's unique dialogue style, I could not help wondering if Ms. Shelly would seem like a different actress playing a non-Hartley part. That's the main reason I picked up this movie at all. It turns out that the Hartley characters were indeed a reflection of Hartley. Shelly is different in this movie, but holds on to the charm that illuminated the Hartley movies. I found this movie to be heartfelt and remarkably well written. Shelly and Crudup are both underrated actors who gave subtle depth to these characters that might otherwise have been missing. This is definitely an indie-lover's movie, but if you like a good story, captivating dialogue, and great acting, you'll like this movie. I truly wish actors like Shelly and Crudup could get more exposure in higher-profile films instead of the Keanu Reaveses and J-Lo's that are shoved down our throats. (note: \"Almost Famous\" was a good start.)",
