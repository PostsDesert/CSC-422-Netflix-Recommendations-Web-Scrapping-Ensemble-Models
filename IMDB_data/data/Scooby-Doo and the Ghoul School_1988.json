I thought this film was funny w/ pretty good characters throughout & of course Matches who is a pet, little fire-breathing green dragon. It also had a good, slightly creepy feel to it that I also identify w/ in other 80's cartoons. The private boys school next door to the ghoul school was funny & seemed like a perfect scenario for our Scooby trio...good beginning & good ending. Loved it.",
