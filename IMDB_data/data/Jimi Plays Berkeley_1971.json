        "reviewBody": "A quick explanation of the rating: 9.5 out of 10 for Hendrix, 2 out of 10 for the crap camera work, editing, nonsensical irrelevant footage, filler and other junk. And deduct a million more stars for gratuitously editing Jimi's guitar solos in Machine Gun, Voodoo Child and others. Seriously, what the f...? So anyway, average em out and (since you can't actually deduct a million stars) you come to six stars. It pains me to rate a Hendrix video so low, but honestly, this film looks like it was done by a bunch of kids with dad's super 8 camera.\n\nHendrix himself is, of course, incendiary and his backup, the Band of Gypsys era duo featuring Billy Cox on bass and Mitch Mitchell on drums, are also pretty on-form. Jimi's performances, as I've often said, tend to be kind of like sex: when they're good they're awesome, and when they're bad... they're still pretty darn good! I've heard that there's an expanded re-release of this video coming out or is already available. Might be worth looking for, if only to restore what should never have been removed in the first place. Editing a Hendrix solo is a bit like abridging the Bible: the six commandments, the one and a half gospels, the sermon on the little knoll, the penultimate supper, Paul's telegrams to the Corinthians, Jesus's pretrial hearing before Pontius Pilate's younger brother, and so on. In other words: sacrilege!",
