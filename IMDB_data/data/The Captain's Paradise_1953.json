        "reviewBody": "Alec Guinness lives \"The Captain's Paradise\" in this 1953 Ealing light comedy. Guinness plays the captain of a ferry going from the British colony of Gibraltor to Spanish Morocco, who, according to his chief officer Ricco (Charles Goldner), has found the recipe for true happiness. He is, so sayeth the officer, a genius.\n\nHis recipe is a simple one, and as we have learned recently, with the news of Charles Lindbergh having another family in Germany, and the book \"Pilot\" - it's more common that we knew. The captain, Henry St. James, has a wife in each port. Celia Johnson is his British wife, a homemaker and excellent cook. The two lead an orderly life - in bed by 10, and when he comes home, he brings her a gift for the household. His Moroccan wife, who calls him \"Jimmy,\" is Yvonne DeCarlo. She's sexy, a dancer who loves the nightlife. The two drink champagne, take moonlight swims, and go dancing.\n\nOf course, as time goes on, problems ensue. For one thing, the women become bored with their roles.\n\nA very funny film, with an interesting message about roles and how, as people grow older, they want to take on different ones.\n\nGuinness is excellent as the happy and then frustrated man in their lives. The best scene, though, is Celia Johnson dancing with her cousin Bob (Walter Crisham) - hilarious.\n\nHighly recommended",
