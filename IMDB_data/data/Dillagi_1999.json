In fact, Sunny did a great job as a first time director, which is well-deserved and commendable. There was some comedy and some good drama. Sunny as the big brother and Bobby as the brat acted very well. Although, this movie is a love story, but it was more than just that. It had many fun moments. Songs were decent, and the Punjabi style was excellent. One could have wished that Dharmendra was in the movie, but all 3 Deols are coming together in Apne this year (boxing drama), which is awesome. I wish that Sunny directs a movie later on in his career.",
