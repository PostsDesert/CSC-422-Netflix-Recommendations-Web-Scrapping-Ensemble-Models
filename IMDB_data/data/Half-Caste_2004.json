        "reviewBody": "At first I thought, 'Who is this guy with U2 glasses talking a mile a minute?' Actually, he was quite engaging, which made this fast paced African thriller an absolute adventure and quite unique in its story. It delves into the world of lycanthropy and reveals a creature from the bush quite similar to the werewolf and the vampire. The difference in Half-Caste is, it doesn't rely on a load of bloody effects to create the suspense, but rather, explains how this African witchcraft can get into someone's head and make them believe that they are an animal or in this case, a human leopard. It was the weirdest moving creature I have ever seen and was pretty scary at times. A number of the scenes were amazing, and despite being South African, I have no idea how they got that huge lion to jump on that jeep and attack that ranger. Stunning."
