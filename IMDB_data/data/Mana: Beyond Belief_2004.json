        "reviewBody": "The panoply of human belief systems is infinitely greater than this film - or any film can present, but the sample provided herein is executed with great sensitivity and peerless cinematographic art. The comedy evident in some of the scenes develops from the activities themselves - and isn't forced by the producers. The 92 minutes seems to fly, and you may find yourself - as I did - slack-jawed by the time the credits roll.\n\nWe saw this film in a college art center seminar room with one of the producers (Manley) in attendance, and he stated that \"...while this is a documentary, not everything in it is 'true.'\" You don't really want to know anything about this film before seeing it. Just let it wash over you and let it speak for itself, as it does so eloquently.\n\nHighy recommended...",
