        "reviewBody": "This adaption of \"Annie\" is an excellent piece of film making. The casting,\n\ndirection, writing, choreography all come together in perfect balance to entertain people of all ages.\n\nMy only wish is that budget and time constraints would have allowed for the\n\nentire original story and score to remain in tact. The Hooverville / \"We'd Like to Thank You Mr. Hoover\" sequence in the original stage musical was perfect in\n\nshowing the effects of the depression, as well as giving us the introduction to Sandy. I only hope that future TV musicals allow the time for the full production, much like the 1993 version of \"Gypsy\" starring Bette Midler.\n\nI've noticed that some people have commented about the multi-racial casting\n\nand how secretary Grace would never have been a black woman. Historically,\n\nthis is most likely correct, but again let's keep in mind that this is musical theatre and for people to just start singing with invisible musicians isn't very realistic either. I'm glad to see that Audra MacDonald was cast because she has the\n\nperfect acting skills, personality and voice to play Grace. Even though many of these stories are traditionally \"white\", the ability to cast multi-ethnic roles only enriches the piece and is completely appropriate in our modern society."
