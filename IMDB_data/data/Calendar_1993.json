        "reviewBody": "A pleasant and amusing story about three senior high school students (although all look way older than that) who are infatuated with Marilyn Monroe. (so am I am and who isn't or wasn't?) It is a nice movie about the importance of the value of good friends. There are various sub plots here. Jason Priestley's character learns to reconnect with his estranged father and all three young men learn and grow by the end of the movie. It is funny and amusing and really rather sweet. I enjoyed it and I recommend it. Jason Priestly does a good job, but he is so much shorter, he is 5'6 or 5'7, than the other two boys who are 6 ft, and he is always looking so short--they even hold him up to see an event in the movie. Anyway, it is an enjoyable movie and one especially suited to teenagers, and, of course, all us Marilyn Monroe fans. There are various clips from Marilyn's movies. Lest we forget.",
