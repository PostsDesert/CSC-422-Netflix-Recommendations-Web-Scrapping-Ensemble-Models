It contains two stories featuring the lovable bear Winnie-the-Pooh and his friends Piglet, Roo, Eeyore, Owl and Gopher.\n\nThe stories feature plots mostly based on Piglet and his daring mission in trying to be brave in a couple of spooky and scary situations. It's full of adventures, light-hearted humor and messages of friendship - all set behind the innocent, carefree and peaceful One Hundred Acre Wood. \n\nThough not as great as the original Winnie-the-Pooh movie, these stories continue the whimsical and thoughtfulness of the Winnie-the-Pooh adventures and are great for the entire family, leaving unforgettable childhood memories. \n\nGrade B-",
