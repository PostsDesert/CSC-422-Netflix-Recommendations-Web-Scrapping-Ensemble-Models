He rocked the mic on \"Def Comedy Jam\", so who wouldn't be surprised? In addition, I thought the opening to the movie was clever. Although the movie is mainly comedy, it was nice how the filmed began with a short documentary rather than that skit at the opening credits of \"Eddie Murphy: Raw\". However, I liked that stand-up show as well, so \"Runteldat\" definitely is up there with \"Raw\", \"The Original Kings of Comedy\", and both of John Leguizamo's shows. In conclusion, I could care less what the media had to say about Martin Lawrence. He's still \"all about the Benjamins\", so let him do his thing!"
