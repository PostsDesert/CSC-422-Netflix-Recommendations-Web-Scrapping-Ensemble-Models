        "reviewBody": "Bettie Page: The Girl in the Leopard Print Bikini (2004) \n\n*** (out of 4)\n\nThis here is a rather low-key documentary on the life and career of Bettie Page. If you're looking for something well-detailed then there are much better films out there but this here at least gives you a good understanding of her career, her rise to fame and what happened after she left the spotlight.\n\nThe best thing about this documentary is that you do get clips from several of her films. These clips are still fun to watch in the way they presented sexuality to men who were looking for anything and Page was more than they could have bargained for. There are also some good stories told about what happened to Page after she left the spotlight and how it eventually found her again.\n\nThe narration is a tad bit annoying at times and especially when it seems to mock the type of films she appeared in. I'd also say that the film would have benefited from some interviews with the people who knew Page. With that said, those unfamiliar with Page will find a lot of useful information here and it will help them get a better understading of what made her a legend."
