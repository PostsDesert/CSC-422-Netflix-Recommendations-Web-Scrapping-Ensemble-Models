Longer than the typical Popeye being done at the time (by quite a bit), it justifiably received a great deal of fanfare and notice on its release and is considered one of the finest animated shorts ever made by a great many people (including me). This runs on Cartoon Network occasionally and is well worth getting a look at. I believe it has at least once or twice been available on VHS. Most highly recommended.",
