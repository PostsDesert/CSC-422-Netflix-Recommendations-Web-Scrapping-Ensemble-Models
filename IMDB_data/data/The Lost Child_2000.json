        "reviewBody": "\"The Lost Child\" is the story of Rebecca, a woman who is looking for her birth family. She posts inquiries (sp) over the Internet, and finally gets a response from a Navajo woman named Grace, who turns out to be her sister.\n\n Rebecca goes out to visit the family, and meets her father, Yazzi Monroe, as well as Grace and her other sisters, and her extended family. From there, she gets pulled into the culture. Her husband and two daughters, however, are not fond of rez life, but they go anyway.\n\nI videotaped this movie the night it aired on television, and watched it several times. Keep your eyes open for the beautiful Irene Bedard (\"Smoke Signals\") as Grace, and Mercedes Ruehl (\"Frasier\") as Rebecca. The scenery is beautiful, as well.\n\nBut, one thing is the problem, and that is on this message board. I don't know what all the fuss is about this being unrealistic?\n\n I can understand the question of why Rebecca doesn't continue to search for her long-lost twin, but you have to understand that she was excited about meeting her birth father, and birth sisters. For what we know, she may have looked into the matter afterwards.\n\nAnd as for no one wanting to move to the reservation, I can say that I would in a second. Whenever I go to the rez to visit family, I get a strange, yet good, feeling, something I would never feel in my native Pennsylvania. Heck, in a years time, I'll be living the good life on the rez, without any regrets."
