        "reviewBody": "Odd mix of original language, voice-over (multiple narrators with not distinctive enough voices), filmed drama, attempt at a documentary. I found it enjoyable, because I enjoy nearly everything about the classical world, and enjoy accuracy if the entertainment factor isn't there.\n\nIt was nice to see some myths defused, such as gladiators were always killed in the matches. But information regarding the building itself was glossed over. It's an architectural marvel, and deserves as much attention as the bloody spectacles that went on inside.\n\nSo if you're a history buff, this isn't boring. If you're not, you may be bored and possibly confused. And it seems that something with this big a budget could have been better. The voice over narrative consists of quotes, the narrator, the subject of the story (Verus the slave), so it gets a bit crowded.\n\nThe big cat facts and portrayal were probably the most interesting parts of the video",
