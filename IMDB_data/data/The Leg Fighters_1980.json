        "reviewBody": "Yet another revenge tale with humor about a no good nick who challenges his rival and is killed. The no good nick's family vows revenge.\n\nSilly Kung Fu movie ruined by the complete lack of contact in the fight scenes. Yea I know its faked but I don't need to see how far away the blows are when they are not landing. It becomes ridiculous when people die without ever being hit. Still if you like this sort of silliness its worth a shot, but its not something that you really need to see. I'd wait for this to play on a Kung Fu Theater show on cable.\n\n4 out of 10 due to the poor fight photography and really bad dubbing (even by Kung Fu standards)",
