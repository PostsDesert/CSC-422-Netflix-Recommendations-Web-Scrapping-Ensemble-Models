        "reviewBody": "I'm watching it for the first time in a decade and also the first time with English subtitles rather than English voice acting (recommended by the way). It's not a fantastic show. It just isn't. It's an anime about anthropomorphic herdgehogs, it's not gonna be winning any Emmys. It is overdramatic and incredibly edgy, especially the episodes including Shadow. It's storylines are kinda dumb. But it's also the first Sonic cartoon I watched that actually has serious stuff going on. There's death and stuff, ya know? It's not purely a kids tv show. And even though that makes it come off as edgy and a little off, I still like it. It's definitely not for everyone, just for people who already know the characters and don't mind watching a show where you're invested in what's going on half of the time and and smiling about how ridiculous it all is the other half. If you can put up with that, then it's something that's enjoyable enough to watch.",
