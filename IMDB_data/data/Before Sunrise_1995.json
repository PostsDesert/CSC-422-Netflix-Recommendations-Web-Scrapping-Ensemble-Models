Their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached. This is about love but not stupid things like in \"notting hills\" or those kind of movie. This is life and i did believe in them, i did believe they were falling... This was so clever and touching. I have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see them as soon as possible again.\n\nI have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake, a concept, but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere, somehow and some when, something could really happen.\n\nI'm french and didn't know very well July Delpy despite Kieslowski \"three colors : white\"... Now i have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect acting.\n\ni saw \"before sunset\" (the sequel in Paris) a few days before i saw \"before sunrise\" and their is no matter. They are both masterpieces. proof that you don't need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings. I'm sorry for my English which i m trying to best.\n\nFranck in France",
