This 92 minutes gem is actually for sale at video stores (many Full Moon Videos are not available) because they now distribute for themselves! This is another chapter of the Subspecies series and is directed by the same director, Ted Nicolaou. The story continues when Ash, an understudy of Radu, becomes more powerful and vicious as his master and the vampire-hunter must destroy him. The special effects are much more advanced in this chapter and you can actually see the vampire's \"shadow morph\" travel. This, like the other parts, was filmed in Romania and has a very ancient \"feel\" to it. The story is great, as is the filming. What else could we expect from our favorite company but another \"must-have?\" As always, a Video Zone is included."
