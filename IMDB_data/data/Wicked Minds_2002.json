If you for any reason still want to see it you'll probably survive, but you'll never be able to make up for the lost hour and a half. \n\nAndrew Walker is very cute and sure there is a twist, but since you now know there is a twist you'll be looking for it and then it's not that surprising. Note this is a standard thriller made for TV. \n\nThe music in this movie sets the tone like it should, but also reveals when something isn't right - a good tool when figuring out the plot in advance.",
