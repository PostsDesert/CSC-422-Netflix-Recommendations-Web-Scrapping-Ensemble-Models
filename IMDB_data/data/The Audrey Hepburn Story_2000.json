        "reviewBody": "To be perfectly fair, I'll go ahead and say that the actual movie in itself is not totally unbearable, especially considering that it is a made for tv movie about a woman whose greatness is probably hard to even understand for most people these days. It could have been much better, but it seems like all movies of this type are like that. What bothers me about it so much is that Jennifer Love Hewitt played Audrey Hepburn. Now I realize that actresses aren't exactly what they used to be, especially young actresses, but Jennifer Love Hewitt?? That's just ridiculous. To me, JLH is the anti-Audrey. She doesn't have any of the class and dignity that Audrey had. Her portrayal of Audrey was terrible and when she sang her pop version of Moon River I almost had to leave the room. Seriously. I remember hearing that they considered Winona Ryder for the part. She's no Audrey but she would have been ten times better than JLH. Natalie Portman would have been almost perfect. The movie definitely did not do Audrey justice. Jennifer Love Hewitt should be forced to make a public apology along with whoever did casting...just kidding."
