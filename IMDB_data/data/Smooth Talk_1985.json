        "reviewBody": "This movie was actually shown on PBS when it first came out, and many schools also utilize it in English class.\n\nIt is an interesting drama revolving around Connie (Laura Dern), her friends, and adolescent life in rural Northern California, or any other average American small-town.\n\nBasically, Connie is attempting to escape her stifling everyday life; she and her mother are constantly at odds (well played by Mary Kay Place); and she spends most of her time at the mall; just like many kids, she has no direction, but enjoys meeting other kids at the local hamburger stand; eventually, after several encounters, she meets Treat Williams, who is a little different than most boys.....\n\nThe short story by Oates was actually based on the true story of a serial killer in Tucson AZ, who was nicknamed the \"Pied Piper of Tucson\". The story takes off into more tension from there; you should read the short story, as you will get the meaning of Arnold Friend/Treat Williams a lot better; the character is well portrayed by Treat Williams; suave, smooth and dangerous.....just what most young girls are attracted to.\n\nAll in all, a very good movie; and Laura Dern was good in the role, very vulnerable and impressionable; the novel projected the impression of a more standard beauty for the times....perhaps an actress like Jenny Garth or Mira Sorvino.",
