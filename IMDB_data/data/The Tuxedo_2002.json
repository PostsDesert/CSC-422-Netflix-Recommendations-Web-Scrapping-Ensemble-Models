        "reviewBody": "The movie concerns a hapless chauffeur called Tong (Jackie Chan) who hiding himself from a secret agent (Jason Isaacs) wears his special gadget-laden tuxedo with extraordinary powers . This discovery thrusts Tong into world of international espionage and intrigue and pairs him with an inexperienced colleague . As Jackie Chan and another agent (Jennifer Lowe Hewitt) will have to take on a villain who's wanting to rule over the world . \n\nFrom start to finish humor and action-packed is interminable . In the film there are intrigue , tongue in cheek , pursuits , frenetic action and includes lots of fun . The movie didn't fail at the box office and neither was a real success .\n\nAction carried out by Jackie Chan was realized by means of specials effects to difference other films in which he made his own stunts . Jennifer Hewitt is pretty gorgeous making with Jackie Chan a type of ¨Buddy movie¨ film . Final confrontation between starring and the baddies is breathtaking and astounding . The picture will appeal to Jackie Chan fans.\n\nRating : 5,5/10 nice and entertaining .",
