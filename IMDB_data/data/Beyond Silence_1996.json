I think that \"Beyond the Silence\" does a pretty good job of showing the difficulty and extra responsibilities that a child with deaf parents experiences.\n\nIf you enjoyed this movie, I would suggest reading the book \"At a Loss for Words.\" It's a very touching story about a girl growing up with deaf parents and coming to terms with her feeling of guilt and anger and also love for them.\n\nI'm not trying to be \"preachy,\" but PLEASE don't call deaf people \"mute.\" That term is negative and out-of-date.",
