But that's where the problem is, there's no chemistry really written in the movie and their attraction comes out of nowhere really, even though I do like them. It needs better writing.\n\nI just can't get over this really adorable idea not being written to its fullest.\n\nLove the British and Mexican agents. Great personality!!",
