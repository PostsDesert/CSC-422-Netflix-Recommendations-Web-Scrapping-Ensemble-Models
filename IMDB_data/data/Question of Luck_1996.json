        "name": "92 minutes of Spanish erotic-mystery thriller starred by a good cast as Eduardo Noriega and Anna Galiena",
        "reviewBody": "This is an intriguing and suspenseful Spanish production full of thrills , sexual scenes , cheating , twists and turns . A good-looking young guy called Julio Muñoz (Eduardo Noriega) living in a little town on the Basque coast is set to marry his girlfriend named Concha (Leire Berrocal) but a series of deeds pose objections , as he takes up with another woman shortly thereafter , as he spontaneously becomes passionately involved with a foreign Milf . While driving his motorbike he finds a crashed car and a loot of jewels . Then , he nearly rents a room from a bombshell as well as mature French widow called Marie (Anna Galiena) , as Julio swiftly becomes romantically involved with the gorgeous woman . However his opening few days at her new residence are tainted by treason and deception , following a string of mystifying incidents .\n\nExciting thriller plenty of emotion , suspense , intrigue , delusions and plot twists . Despite being somewhat of a cinematic cliché, rarely has a feature been so aptly deserving of its description as a thriller film along with some elements from Noir cinema such as Femme Fatale appearance . It is an entertaining picture in which suspense is well developed from start to finish , though crammed with abundant erotic scenes -in softcore style- between Eduardo Noriega and Anna Galiena . Interesting as well as twisted screenplay from Luis Marias , following a ¨Basic instinct¨ wake filled with intrigue , turns , and sexual situations . This is a film when the roles of good and bad change really quickly, and when you start making your own conclusions on the topic, suddenly something happens and you instantly change the course of your thoughts . Acceptable performance by protagonist duo as Eduardo Noriega an ambitious , unfortunate young and Anna Galiena as a sexy French widow with a shady past . Nice support cast such as Marta Belaustegui as Pili , Leire Berrocal as Concha and Ion Gabella as Alfonso . Furthermore , a special appearance of veteran and experienced actor Simon Andreu . Thrilling and mysterious musical score by Bernardo Bonezzi composed by means of synthesizer . Glamorous and colorful cinematography filmed on location in Basque country and Bidasoa . I think it's a decent thriller and it sure kept me interested till the very end . Recommended to the suspense , mystery lovers and thriller buffs .\n\nThe motion picture was compellingly directed by Rafael Monleon in his fifth and last film , going on filming TV series , the first one was ¨Baton Rouge¨ with Antonio Banderas and Victoria Abril . Rafael Monleón was born as Rafael Moleón Gavilanes . He is a director and writer, especially known for Baton Rouge (1988), and this ¨question of luck¨ . He has directed all kind of genres such as comedy : ¨Tretas de Mujer¨ , children movie : ¨El Niño invisible¨ and thriller : ¨Mirada Liquida¨ and ¨Cuestion de Suerte¨ .",
