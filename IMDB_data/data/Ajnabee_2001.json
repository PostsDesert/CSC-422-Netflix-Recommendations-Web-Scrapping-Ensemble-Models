Anyways, it's the first picture added in the image list in the IMDb, so you can see it there. The movie started slow. Very slow. I hated the songs. 4 songs, some seemed highly unnecessary. Akshay Kumar enters late. But the movie takes pace since, takes meaning. Akshay Kumar was so sensational, he made his chemistry even with Bobby great along with the other two. Bobby was average. Bipasha was super hot. There were few exotic scenes in the movie, too much considering it was the very early 2000s. But not much at all in this era of web series n tv series. Akshay Kumar and Johnny lever added so much fun in the movie, they made it quite Entertaining. Yes, it was a thriller with comedy. Excellent last 60 minutes and the climax. Apart of the songs, and the initial romance, the movie was great. Enjoyed it. Recommended if a Bollywood fan. \n* Pawan P\n",
