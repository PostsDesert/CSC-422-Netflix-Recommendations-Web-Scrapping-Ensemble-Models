        "reviewBody": "I was 17 years old when I first saw this movie on HBO. I was enthralled by WWII history already at this point. This movie opened my eyes to a whole other area of history that was missing in the history books of the small 99.5% white town I grew up in. The challenges these hero's faced just to serve their country they so loved while a good percentage of the country loathed them is deserving of a decoration in and of itself. This is mostly what the movie focuses on. However, the record of the men of 332d is second to none; no other unit in WWII could boast that while escorting, they never lost a bomber. John Lithgow also plays a good bit-part in the movie. He is a much better actor than I because I could never play a part where I had to utter such bigoted garbage as he did in this movie. Laurence Fishburne and Andre Braugher deliver stellar performances as Hannibal Lee and the great military leader Benjamin O. Davis. This film is a definite must see for any WWII history fan and a great movie for everyone else. Too bad it was never released in the box office I think it would have faired well.",

For amazing stories set in World War II, check out 'Unbroken,' 'The Tuskegee Airmen,' and 'Greyhound.' For films featuring women making major breakthroughs, watch 'Hidden Figures' and 'On the Basis of Sex.' If a Chadwick Boseman double feature is in the cards, catch him playing Jackie Robinson in '42' and Thurgood Marshall in 'Marshall.' For a fictional hero to root for in the fight against extraterrestrial invaders, check out 'Independence Day.' And lastly, to celebrate the original American Independence Day, drop the mic with 'Hamilton.'",
