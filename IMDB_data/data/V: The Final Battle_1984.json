Looking back, it is obvious that this is a very high quality production not the ordinary made for TV drivel. With a great concept and terrific acting by Marc Singer, Faye Grant, and Michael Ironside, interest is held throughout the full 10 hours. Except for the phony ending, the entire saga is great. Special effects were also state of the art then. When I compare the laser blasts in Star Wars with V FB, no contest. V rules. PLEASE PUT THIS ON DVD.",
