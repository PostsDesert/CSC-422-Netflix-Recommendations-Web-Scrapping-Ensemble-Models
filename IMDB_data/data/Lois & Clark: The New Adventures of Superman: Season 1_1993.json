That goes for Teri Hatcher as well, her portrait of Lois Lane is just...SUPER!\n\nThe different directors and screenwriters have done an excellent job of bringing Clark Kent back to the screen. The idea of giving Clark Kent a full background and some real space to act in, is just ingenious. Lane Smith and Justin Whalin are also worth mentioning - they are both excellent in their roles as Perry and Jimmy.\n\nNow, why haven't this fantastic series come out on DVD?"
