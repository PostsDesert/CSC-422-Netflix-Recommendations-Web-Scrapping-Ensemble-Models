Seven girlfriends who have know each other for more than fifteen years, reunite for a week-end together. You get everything during these two days : love, humour, laughs, friendship, new couple reunited, fresh new couple formed by two longtime girlfriends, a longtime lesbian couple newly parents, an heterosexual friend who becomes pregnant, some drama and pretty women. And after seeing the magical lesbian series THE L WORD (2004), we agreed to say it has the same kind of rhythm, the same kind of pace, the same kind of approach talking about the modern lesbian life, and seven girlfriends as in this movie. It is wonderful to have THE L WORD and this pretty good movie in the same house! And both can be re-visited as many times as you feel!"
