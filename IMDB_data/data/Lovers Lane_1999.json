Well, this stupid video pic was very dry, slow, badly-acted, and the ending was sooo confusing and the script was sooo bad...I could go on for hours about how terrible this movie is. True, it tries to seem more like an eighties slasher bash rather than the more modern \"Scream\" bullc***, but it still doesn't work and I just didn't like it at all."
