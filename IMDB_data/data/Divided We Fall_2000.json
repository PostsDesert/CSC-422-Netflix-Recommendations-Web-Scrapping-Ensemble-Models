Two of them play a little prank on the chauffer. In the next scene, the chauffer is in charge, and the family of the boy who played the prank (the bosses who happened to be Jewish) are being evicted of their big house.\n\nAnd this is just a very minor aspect of the film. There are selfish people, and there are selfless people in this film, and more often than not they are the same people. Of course, those who want things spelled out for them would like to know if Josef makes the decision that is central to the plot to save his skin, to save David's, or to make his wife (who wants to have children) happy.\n\nThis is not a Hollywood film. I like American movies, most of the time. They are great for entertainment, but if I want something for my mind and my soul, something that can make me laugh, cry, and think, then this is the kind of movie I want.",
