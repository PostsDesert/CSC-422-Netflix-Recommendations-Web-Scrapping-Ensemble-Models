I didn't find much funny here though the music was pretty entertaining and seeing all that action done to it was also pretty good. This was directed by Rudolf Ising who was partnered with Hugh Harmon as co-producers. Their last names make that musical description sound, if you didn't know (Harmon-Ising, harmonizing, get it?). They were partnered with Leon Schlesinger at this time though disagreements over budgets got them leaving him at Warner Bros. and ending up at M-G-M. Anyway, Three's a Crowd is worth a look for any animation buffs out there.",
