        "reviewBody": "I attended the second Bonnaroo Festival and highly anticipated the release of the DVD. I thoroughly enjoyed the first festival's DVD and thought that it was truly a great reminder of the awesome time that I had there. This one however let me down when compared to the first one. I enjoy the performances, but as with the first one, there were definitely artists who I felt should have been included. That being said, I did enjoy the performances chosen from the Dead, Medeski Martin and Wood, the Polyphonic Spree, the Flaming Lips, and My Morning Jacket. I would however like to say that I felt that the way that the performances were presented was a little of a let down. Most of the live music clips have been edited to resemble music videos instead of live performances. I would have enjoyed it more if they had just been shots of the band playing mixed with clips of people dancing to the music. There are a couple of instances where the music is playing ,but the musicians are obviously not even playing that song. It just happened to be a cooler video clip then what was actually happening on stage.\n\nI would also like to say that I was disappointed that this Bonnaroo DVD did not focus as much on the festival as a whole as the first. The first DVD had many scenes of people setting up camp, selling stuff on \"Shakedown Street\", and enjoying the entire festival experience. I basically just feel that this DVD does not do justice to the fact that while Bonnaroo is a music festival, a large factor to its appeal is the fact that 75,000+ can come together and live together in their own little community for a weekend. The first DVD made a point to comment on this while the newer one barely touches on this at all. Just a little annoyance by me, but I feel that the director could have done more to show the entire Bonnaroo experience in his DVD.",
