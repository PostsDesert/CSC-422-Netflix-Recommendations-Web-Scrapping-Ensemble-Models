His dad (Powers Boothe) then spends 10 years searching for him and eventually succeeds, but only by chance. He decides to stay with the tribe rather than go back to his original family. \n\nBoothe's son when grown up is played by the director's son, Charley Boorman and does a great job playing the part. This movie gives you an idea on what it would be like living in the Amazon. Excellent scenery makes the movie better still. It was shot on location in the Amazon.\n\nI have seen this movie a couple of times and enjoyed very much. Watch it if you get the chance.\n\nRating: 4 stars out of 5."
