        "name": "Palestinian Arab families tour Israel. An unfiltered, average, Palestinian perspective.",
        "reviewBody": "It's about 5-10 Palestinian/families taking a tour of Israel. Apparently it is the only way that they can enter Israel proper. The whole of it is in Arabic or Hebrew and it is all sub-titled. It is broken into seven chapters, of which the titles are things like \"I never would have believed I would walk next to a Jew.\"\n\nAt one point they take a tour of an Israeli museum with of course an Israeli host, speaking Hebrew, and I loved how the documentarist re-visited the tour with the Palestinian Arabs reflections on what they had seen and been told.\n\nThe most poignant part of the documentary to me was when this single Palestinian Arab whom had taken the tour, was able to see his Mother for the first time in years, and how they exchanged photographs by throwing them over the border between Israel and Lebanon.\n\nThat's right, his family (Mother & siblings, Dad's dead by Israeli forces, I think) live in Lebanon, and since the West Bank where he lives does not border Lebanon, and because Lebanon will not let him into their country either, this bus tour of Israel was the only way for him to see his family.\n\n Anyway. For us Westerners, I more or less thought I knew the feelings that the Palestinians had, but it was very enlightening to me to see and hear the average Palestinian first hand. It hasn't changed any of my opinions of the mess in the Middle East, but it has given me a personal, new perspective.",
