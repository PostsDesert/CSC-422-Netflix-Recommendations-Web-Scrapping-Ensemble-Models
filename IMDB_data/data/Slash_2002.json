        "reviewBody": "I happened to be surfing through channels one evening, and saw that \"Slash\" was about to begin. Since it was a horror movie, I gave it a try, and it was actually a surprise. The film revolves around a rock band, called Slash. The group of band members end up at a secluded old farm out in the middle of nowhere, when the band's lead singer's aunt dies and he goes to visit his father at the family home. Things begin to get a little bit spooky when strange events plague the band members. It seems someone is lurking around the farm, putting a stop to all of their attempts to leave. Someone wants them to stay, and then the band members begin to die off. Who is behind the killings? Is it the creepy farm handyman? Or perhaps someone else? \n\nI actually thought this movie wasn't that bad at all. The story (while it is somewhat routine) was interesting enough to keep my attention. The twist ending was obvious but appropriate in the film's context, it worked well. The acting was so-so... let's just say that there aren't exactly Oscar-worthy performances. But what can one expect from a film of this nature, the cast is mostly unknowns (aside from Steve Railsback who plays the band's lead singer's father). The scripting was somewhat corny at times, and some of the characters made stupid remarks, but I wouldn't make a big deal about it, because \"Slash\" is a B-grade horror flick all the way. The death scenes were creative, especially the harvesting machinery sequence, which was quite brutal, and the setting of the film was isolated and kind of spooky. The finale itself was well executed also and the killer throughout the film was pretty cool.\n\nOverall, \"Slash\" is really nothing new for horror fans, but it manages to be a decent and fun little movie to view. Complete with a rock soundtrack, some gory death scenes, and an overall decent story, it serves it's purpose and manages to be alright in the end. Horror fans will find it enjoyable, others will probably hate it. 6/10.",
