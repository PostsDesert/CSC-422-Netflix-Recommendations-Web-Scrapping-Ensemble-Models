Many of the stories were good, but there were some clinkers, as well. Some of the actors and actresses that appeared were those that viewers would recognize from other TV series and B-grade movies (Joan Severance, Steven Bauer, Denise Crosby, Matt LeBlanc, Francisco Quinn, Paula Barbieri, etc.). This was one of two TV series that David Duchovny appeared in before he starred on \"The X-Files\" (the other was the odd \"Twin Peaks\")."
