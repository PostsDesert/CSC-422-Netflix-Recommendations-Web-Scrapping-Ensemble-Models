        "reviewBody": "I don't really like Keven Costner but I like him a far sight better than I do Russel Crowe, and while his movies do tend towards the \"revisionist\" style, there is something to be said for this version of Robin Hood. I will freely admit the Errol Flynn version is superior in story but this movie has style where it may lack substance.\n\nApparently, Kevin Costner does not know how to pull off a character with such depth and range as Robin Hood. Whether he lacks the ability to interpret the character or just lacks as an actor I have never cared enough to determine but his failings are upheld widely by the team of Alan Rickman and Michael Wincott who absolutely steal the show.\n\nThis is not to say that this version of the story is without merit. It is worth seeing if only for Morgan Freeman, Wincott, and Rickman. And I'll guarantee you that this version will absolutely SHINE in comparison to Crowe's Nottingham (due out 2010). Honestly, the only actor MORE wrong for Robin Hood than Kevin Costner is Russell Crowe. Oy.\n\nAll in all? This is dark and sweeping. It is fun and entertaining and I LIKE IT! \n\nIt rates a 6.8/10 from...\n\nthe Fiend :.",
