        "reviewBody": "This wonderful tribute to Elvis hosted by Priscilla Presley contains home movies, interviews, clips from the '68 comeback special, Aloha from Hawaii, outtakes, Elvis: That's the Way it is, his films - in short, everything you could possibly want to see in an Elvis tribute. Priscilla, Lisa Marie, Priscilla's parents, Elvis' cousin, and Jerry Schilling give the audience great insight into Elvis' personality, Priscilla's life with him, his differences with Colonel Tom Parker, his artistic frustrations, his drug problems, and his spiritual quest.\n\nEven for die-hard Elvis fans who have seen and read everything (if that's possible), there will probably be something new here. Outstanding for me were the stories of Elvis' generosity and the continuation of his charitable interests by the family. Most touching, I think, was how much he loved his daughter, and how much, 28 years later, people who were in his life still miss him to the point of tears. The musical highlight: \"If I Can Dream.\" The footage of Elvis on tour shortly before he died is harrowing. I've seen it before, but it never fails to shock. People always talk about the \"fat Elvis\" - in truth, though Elvis was heavier in the '70s than he was in the '60s, it wasn't until the very end that he became badly bloated and obviously ill. But like the documentary, I prefer to dwell on that groundbreaking talent, fabulous songs, magical smile, and unbelievable charisma that was, and always will be, Elvis Presley.",
