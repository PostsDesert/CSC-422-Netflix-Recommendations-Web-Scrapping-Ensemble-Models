        "name": "A good but not brilliant Stephen Chow film",
        "reviewBody": "Stephen Chow plays a selfish yet in some places kind hearted barrister who tricks his servant in doing things for his own benefit.\n\nEric Kot playing the servant is misguided by what he thinks is love and leaves Chow vowing that he will never need Chow's help again in life. Shortly afterwards Kot gets into some big trouble (due to be executed) with the British and calls on Chow for help. Chow tries to help his client, but is fish out of water when he has to fight this court room case according to western rules.\n\nThe story itself is a bit weak, and i found that the film relies on the humour Chow provides. Some moments of the film are extremely funny while some scenes with Eric Kot in are meant to be funny but arent (maybe i just dont get his humour). Nevertheless it is a good Stephen Chow film and a must see for his fans. For the rest of the world, i would recommend that this is a rental. If you want to see some good Stephen Chow films try \"King of Comedy\", \"Shaolin Soccer\", \"Forbidden City Cop\", \"God of Cookery\" and many more. I would give this film 5 out of 10 stars"
