Not knowing what was happening was part of the fun.\n\nI just got to see 'Love Come Down' at the Vancouver International Film Festival. It was one of the best films I have seen in a long time. A dark movie, with well placed humor, that follows the transition of two brothers and the people around them. Both lead actors, Cummins and Tate, made their characters people I cared for. The movie was about Tate's character, but Cummins quietly and darkly stole it from him. The film drew me in completely. One of the final scenes, in the kitchen, had me gripping my chair arms from the tension.\n\nThe artistic way it was filmed, and the use of flashbacks intertwined (quickly and suddenly) into current events, made it very interesting to watch.\n\nMy favorite scene is when the two brothers and their friend are sitting around the new toaster in their kitchen.\n\nI can't wait to see it again!!",
