        "reviewBody": "In my case, AI was the most eagerly awaited of projects. As far back as 1996 when Kubrick announced his attention to basically \"bow out\" with this production, my every instinct told me it would be a masterpiece, the \"2001\" of the new millennium...an expectation I have absolutely no doubt would have eventuated had God not required Kubrick's presence in a Director's chair of his own!\n\nIt is my own personal theory that Kubrick was yet so emmeshed in the potential and development of this great work that he was functioning little above auto-pilot during the three years or so he spent completing the uniquely pointless EYES WIDE SHUT. That Spielberg, great director that he is, should inherit this project, was an accident waiting to happen. It is much akin to asking James Cameron (hand artist extraordinaire - for those who have the slightest idea what I am talking about!) to paint a new \"Van Gough!\" \n\nTo his credit, I believe Spielberg did a pretty good job and has retained many Kubrickian images in his future world. Shots of a submerged New York - the result of the melting of the ice caps - is quite brilliant...the stonework holding up the bridges - great stuff! In the end though we are left with an impossible clash of visions. Kubricks melancholia, Spielberg's \"happy american families.\"\n\nDavid, the young android however, is still for me, despite the futuristic setting, no more than D.A.R.Y.L. revisited which simply HAS to be the film-inspiration for AI."
