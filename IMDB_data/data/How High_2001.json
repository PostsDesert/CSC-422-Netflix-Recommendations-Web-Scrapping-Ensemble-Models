I might watch How High 2 one day, but from what I read on here the movie that was released 18 years after the original does not stand up to this.\n\nAnd it's not that this sets a high filmmaking bar or anything, but it does deliver the goods when it comes to comedy, especially the kind that has to do with ... a certain drug, that has been legalized in some countries and parts of the world. Even if I personally don't smoke at all, it seems that if anyone was to smoke anything it should be this instead of the normal cigarettes that do way more harm to your health.\n\nBut this is not about a social message and should not be viewed as such! This is an over the top comedy that does not make much sense in the real world (a lot of this are being taken to a degree that are plain ridiculous - for comedy effect). The movie has quite the charm I have to admit and if you are not too PC, you can and will laugh at the madness at hand here",
