        "reviewBody": "Each of the shorts were unique; the only one I didn't really click with was Pitt's \"Joy Street\", although it was still very well done and I think the loveliest visual work in the film, consisting of dramatic watercolor work (both stills and animation). Technically, Dumala's \"Gentle Spirit\" is probably the best, generating a real sense of dread with it's animation method, tone, and visual symbols. There is not a single word of dialogue, but it manages to say a lot. \"Abductees\" was great, impressionistic and playful, while doling out some very haunting moments. \"Ape\" has to be my favorite short, though. I thought it had the clearest narrative line, and the sharpest twist ending. Overall, \"Cartoon Noir\" is wonderful work. Not every moment shines, but it is still fascinating to watch."
