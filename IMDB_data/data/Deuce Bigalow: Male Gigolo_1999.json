        "reviewBody": "After watching the commercials for this movie, I was excited about seeing DEUCE BIGALWO: MALE GIGOLO. Although I've never been a big Rob Schneider fan, I've always liked Saturday Night Live and their alumni, and I usually enjoy the movies they make. I was hoping this movie wouldn't be too similar to most Adam Sandler movies that are made. Most of them are stupider than they are funnier. I'd rather watch a movie like TOMMY BOY or THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE than WATERBOY or BILLY MADISON. So I was hoping DEUCE BIGALOW be a little more like those movies. It turns out, this movie was worse than the Adam Sandler movies, and I found most Sandler movies funnier.\n\nDeuce Bigalow (Rob Schneider) plays a pathetic, unemployed, fish-loving tank cleaner who gets a job by a very big male prostitute named Antoine LeConte (Oded Fehr) to take care of his house for three weeks. When Deuce almost destroys the house, he needs to make a few thousand dollars quickly. Through a guy named T.J. (Eddie Griffin) he is able to get a job as a gigolo, but every girl he tries to \"give pleasure\" is very unusual and strange. He finally falls in love with a woman named Kate (Arija Bareikis).\n\nAlthough it had its moments, DEUCE BIGALOW: MALE GIGALO didn't strike me as very funny. The story line is useless (although it isn't really mean to be very important) and most of the jokes that weren't used on the commercials don't work. The funniest parts of the movie were the Matrix spoofs and a few of the jokes, but all of which were already used on the commercials.\n\nThe acting was nothing special, but not so bad. Rob Schneider does fine, but again, nothing special. Arija Bareikis does pretty well as Deuce's girlfriend. Oded Fehr did a pretty good job as the huge, strong male hooker. Eddie Griffin and William Forsythe (who plays a detective) play incredibly annoying characters with not-very-great acting jobs. Norm Macdonald has a pretty good cameo as well.\n\nStory line? Give me a break. It's just Deuce going from one nutcase girl to another and falling in love with the only normal one (well, mostly). Some of the girls do have funny moments, but not enough for me to say I recommend this movie.",
