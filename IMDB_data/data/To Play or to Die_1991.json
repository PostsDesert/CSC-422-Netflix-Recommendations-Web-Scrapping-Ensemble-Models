They both did a very excelling performance.\n\nThe colors are beautiful, the filming is excellent. The \"light\" is superb\n\nSome situations are so recognizable, and so understandable.\n\nThe issue of the situation is shocking, but that is what movies are made for\n\nThis 45 minutes short is like watching a \"full\" movie\", and raises many questions. \n\nI enjoyed it very much. PS, If ever there was a question of \"revenge\": do a \"google pictures\" for both actors :-)",
