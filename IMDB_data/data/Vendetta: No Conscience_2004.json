        "reviewBody": "This movie is a masterpiece. I mean, Daniel Baldwin did appear in some turkeys over the past few years, but this one is a must-see. I don't even think The Godfather is only half as good as this joint. Kristian Bernier does a wonderful job in this movie, just like in Saving Ryan's Privates and Horror 101. And just to remember: this is Daniel McCarthy's first movie, and he was the director, producer, writer AND actor in it. It's a parable on the biblical story of Cain and Able. 10 stars Otto 10, man. I love it. Gibberish Gibberish. This movie is genial. I like women and the scene when they kill the guy where you know, haha it gives me the willies just thinking about it. Wings Hauser was great in this movie, just like as he was in Original Gangster, where he was Michael Casey. And this one bald-headed guy, Lorraine Healey, she was the bomb, maan. Yeah.",
