        "reviewBody": "Best of all the SNL Best of's... Christopher Walken is by far the best host. The Cowbell skit was a classic and the continentals he does are so funny. But the best by far is the Pranksters skit. It leads you in thinking it's corny but takes a completely hilarious turn when Christopher Walken shows up. Brilliant.\n\nThe continentals are second best. In one you can see the cameraman's hand in a mirror and in the other Chris's mustache begins to peel off when champagne is thrown in his face (the audience goes wild with laughter). Other than those two flaws, the movie is pretty solid... except the fact that Chris makes it exceptionally obvious that he's reading from cue-cards. However, he still manages to pull off the creepy comedian he is.",
