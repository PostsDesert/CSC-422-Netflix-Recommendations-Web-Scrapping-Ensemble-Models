Not only beyblade but also every anime has its own world, own theory and own story. I won't give any spoilers but I think japanese dub with eng sub is the best option if you want to get the full credit. English dub don't have some amazing scenes from the anime. You will enjoy the english dub but english sub will be the best to watch.\n\nEvery character is great. Every character's personality is very realistics. It shows the pressure of a champion plus the ups and downs of him, which I really enjoyed. It has an emotional and complete ending. I watched this entire original saga in a month and the last episode cost few drops of my tears.\n\nIn the end I want to say, LET IT RIP!",
