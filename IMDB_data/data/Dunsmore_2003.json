        "reviewBody": "Dunmore is one of those films that creates mixed feelings. On one hand, it is a cheap film with some amateurish editing, direction and cinematography. The script also has a bad habit of wandering and lacking flow at points. On the other hand, though, it is a thoughtful and terrifying film about a small country town named Dunsmore under the domination of one man: Ronny Roy Pritcher. Played with zeal by W. Earl Brown, the film begins with Ronny's murder.\n\nThe story then becomes a whodunit that seeks out motive (pretty much everyone in the town has a reason to kill Ronny) as well as suspects, ultimately very similar to a country town version of the 1974 thriller Murder on the Orient Express. As one character remarks near the beginning, \"Dunsmore killed Ronny.\" And it is true, as this is a film with two main characters: Ronny, and the town of Dunsmore. It is the interactions between Ronny and the group of characters within the town that drive the film from beginning to end.\n\nIt is here that both the greatest flaws and assets are shown. Shot almost like a documentary, each person has their own story and their own demons. Everyone is unique and the way their lives intersect with Ronny's lead to an entertaining maze of suspects and stories. However, at a point the gritty film-making becomes too self-aware and the characters begin to become almost comical in their plights. Especially with one part as an old man is chased through rows of crops in the dead of the night, Dunsmore becomes less of a smart thriller and more of a cheesy horror-fest.\n\nThat's not to say Brown doesn't give Ronny a presence. When he is on screen, he seizes attention. However, he also gives some depth to the character of Ronny who could have easily become an evil caricature. Although the origins of his cruelty are only hinted at in a ridiculous scene of animal torture, Brown has moments to show off charm and at least demonstrate why some people found more than just hate to aim at Ronny. Ultimately, there is no mistaking that this is a small independent movie about a small country town, but the mix of mystery and drama work together to create quite an engaging experience that satisfies more than it disappoints.\n\nCritic's Conclusion: Overall a dark film showing its independent roots, that's not to say Dunsmore fails to have any emotional wallop or to have anything to say. It is an interesting film that shows the still blooming potential of the talent behind it."
