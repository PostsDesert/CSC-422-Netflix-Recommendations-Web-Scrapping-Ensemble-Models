        "reviewBody": "I recognize many of the common Oirish cliches we wish were taken out of Irish films, yet this film isn't about the simple life in an Oirish village such as Waking Ned or BallyK. It deals with a part of our history that my parents well remember. A Love Divided is about a true incident in Co. Wexford in the late 1950's. In order to marry a Catholic, a Protestant woman signs a 'ne temere' pledge to raise their children in the Catholic church. When their oldest daughter reaches the age to start school and the Protestant mother decides she does not want to send her daughter blindly to Catholic school, pledge or no, a string of events takes place that affects the lives of the town and those outside it.\n\nThe acting is brilliant. Liam Cunningham is magnificent as the husband caught between his religion and the family he loves. Orla Brady is equally magnificent as the defiant wife. Some may view this film as another show to the world that Ireland is a land of religious intolerance. I believe the fact that Irish film makers are now portraying incidents in our past such as the one in A Love Divided proves we recognize our past and are no longer doomed to repeat it."
