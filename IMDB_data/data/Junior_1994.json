        "reviewBody": "Arnold Schwarzenegger gets pregnant. That's about it. The premise is ridiculous, the twists and turns in the plot are mind-bogglingly stupid and every joke is predictable and hammered at you--but I still like this film! The script does have it's moments, but the performances really carry this one.\n\nArnie is suprisingly very funny when he becomes pregnant (when asks DeVito in all seriousness \"Does my body disgust you?\" I broke up); DeVito is just along for the ride but is good--he's the straight man to Arnie; Emma Thompson is just gorgeous, very funny and full of life as a clumsy scientist. Also Judy Collins (yes, the singer) pops up looking radiant as the head of a center for pregnant women. Everything looks wonderful and the film is slickly made to cater the the audience. I usually hate films like that, but this worked. The only bad part is Pamela Reed--she's a wonderful actress and comediene but she's shamefully underused--she doesn't get any good funny scenes till the end. Also, where else will you see Arnie in a dress?\n\nIt's a one joke film. Is it a good film? No. Do I like it? Very much. Call it a guilty favorite.\n\nOne complaint--at 2 hours it's too long. Couldn't it have been trimmed a little?",
