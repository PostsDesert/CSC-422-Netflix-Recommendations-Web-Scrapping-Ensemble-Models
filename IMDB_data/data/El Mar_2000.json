He said that it was about the Spanish Civil War, and I thought, \"cool, I'll learn something.\" OH MY GOSH what a FREAKY movie!!! Starting with kids watching a fascist firing squad blowing away communists to one kid beating another's head against a rock until the kid died, this film was gory crap that made one really wonder what in the heck happened to this country (Spain, not the USA). Unless you feel like feeling dirty and getting really disgusted with what happened almost a century ago I would strongly avoid seeing this movie."
