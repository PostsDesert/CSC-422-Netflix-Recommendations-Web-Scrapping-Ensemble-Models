Grab a good stereo and TV and it's like actually being (back) there.\n\nFurtermore (maybe cause they knew it was being taped) the band, not the youngest of guys anymore, unleashed all their live experience and musical abilities to create an entertainment-inferno. The DVD shows the whole concert, which has been recorded with quite a lot of cameras from well-chosen angles.\n\nThose who only know the band by their greatest hits will find this concert movie as enjoyable as those who are able to sing along every syllable with JMS. They actually played rather unknown songs plus two brand new ones along with fresh variations of their smash hits-23 all together.\n\nHighly recommended- not only by me as a die-hard fan but also as someone knowing to value a dedicated production.\n\n9/10 (I think 10/10 is not really something I'll ever experience...)",
