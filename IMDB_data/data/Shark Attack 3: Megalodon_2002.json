It feels like either a really good spoof of Jaws (and lets face it, how many good spoofs do we get nowadays?) or a completely awful rip off of Jaws. From the very first scene with the cigar-chomping incomprehensible sailor guy to the magical size changing shark I was rolling around on the floor laughing. There are actors who look like they are laughing when they are supposed to be crying, there are random bikini girls who strut by during most of the talking scenes, and I haven't even started on the gems in the script (I won't spoil any of it, but it's safe to say: If you know anyone who talks like this in day to day life, please slap them). You have to see this movie.",
