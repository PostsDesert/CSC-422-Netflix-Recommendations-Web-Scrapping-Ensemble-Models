(though I almost cried in the Patriot when Thomas got killed). Anyway, I liked it a whole lot. I didn't see it from the start (missed about thirty minutes) but from what I saw it was a good, realistic movie. I hadn't even known it was a true story until I saw another imdb user's comment on it. It wasn't sappy at all. Sure, Tilden could be annoyingly whiny, but you have to understand what she was going through. In the end, she learned to be to be grateful for things. Thats \"What Girls Learn\"."
