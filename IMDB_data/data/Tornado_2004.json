        "reviewBody": "My girlfriend I went and saw this movie a few weeks ago and we both thoroughly enjoyed it! Although the movie has some absolutely amazing footage of tornado's Â– the film isn't just about chasing storms. It follows a really good plot as it focuses in on the stories of the two main characters. It gets you really involved into the movie. I would literally get anxious each time they'd start off on a new chase, or get anxious in anticipation of how the professors would react when they learned of their daredevil-like stunts. This is definitely one the best documentaries I have seen. The footage was excellent, the commentaries were excellent, and the storyline was excellent. Highly recommended!"
