Right from the start, Temchen life starts to fall apart as soon as she lets Gertz back into her life and her other friends almost seem to take a false sense of pride in forcing Temchen into decisions she refuses to make...\n\nThe chair is an interesting part of this dark, sometimes depressing, film. No matter what happens throughout the film, it always seems to return to the chair. The performance by Gertz is good! I never pictured her in that kind of role, but she did a pretty good job in pulling it off! Her straight-forward character is one of those \"take no guff from anyone\" is the sort of character that made this the film it is. Her anger is real when it shows and her conversations with her co-stars are what kept me involved, because of her unpredictable nature!",
