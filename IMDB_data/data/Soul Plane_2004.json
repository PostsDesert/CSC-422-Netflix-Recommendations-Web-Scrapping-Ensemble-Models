        "reviewBody": "Most comments submitted to IMDb about \"Soul Plane\" are so negative that it would appear this film should not hold anyone's interest. While it is no masterpiece, the movie is not half as bad as most critics seem to indicate.\n\nFirst of all, other mainstream spoofs have dealt with the same clich√©s one sees in \"Soul Plane\". Jesse Terrero, the director, shows a flair for the material. The director has gathered a lot of talented black entertainers in a comedy that is best watched with a lot of friends because there are some hysterical moments in it that are a riot.\n\nIt's true there are stereotypes, but it doesn't seem the creators of the film set out an agenda to hurt anyone. Some jokes play better than others, but with the right attitude, the movie proves to be fun. The use of some of the music plays well within the context of the film.\n\nKevin Hart, Tom Arnold, Snoop Dog, K.D. Cubert, the funny Mo'nique, and the beautiful Sofia Vergara make this a movie with a lot of laughs.\n\nInstead of dwelling in the negative aspects of \"Soul Plane\", just relax, sit back and enjoy.",
