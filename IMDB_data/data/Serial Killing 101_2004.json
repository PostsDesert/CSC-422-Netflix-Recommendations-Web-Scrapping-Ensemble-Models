He meets the nerdy Sasha Fitzgerald(Lisa Loeb, the singer), and she wishes to commit suicide and asks him to assist her in the act. \n\nNoland has the ambition to be a famous, Ted Bundy like murderer but when someone else steals the spotlight, he gets jealous. Thomas Haden Church plays Vince Grimaldi, the rival for media attention. Church is fine, as always, but the film is neither funny or scary and I was bored to death, excuse the pun, by the time Serial Killers for is over, you will feel like a dummy for wasting 89 minutes watching this garbage.",
