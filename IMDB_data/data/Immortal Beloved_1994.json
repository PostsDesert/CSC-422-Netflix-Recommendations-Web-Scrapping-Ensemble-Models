No one knows, to this day, who that person really is, but the film offers an interesting theory. \n\nThe letter, however, is just a device to tell the story of the wild genius who personifies the Romantic movement in art. The letter serves much the same purpose as does Rosebud in CITIZEN KANE -- a method of stringing together a series of flashbacks that reveal the personality of the central figure. \n\nThe acting is wonderful and the music is powerful."
