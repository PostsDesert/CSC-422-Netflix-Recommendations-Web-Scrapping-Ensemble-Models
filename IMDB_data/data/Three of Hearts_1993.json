I think all the actors did a decent job (I've seen Kelly Lynch in other things and she's great), but the plot was wretched and the characters were flimsy. Who acts like these people? \n\nHere's a run down of the main characters: Connie: too over-the-top pathetic Ellen: Hot, but not interesting Joe: WTF!! The moral transformation- \"bad boy turned good\" was phony. \n\nActually the only great character was played by Joe Pantoliano. Maybe the movie should have been about him and not these confused and hard-up people.",
