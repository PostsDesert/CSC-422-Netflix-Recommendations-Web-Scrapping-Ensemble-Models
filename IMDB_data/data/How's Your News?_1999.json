At first glance, the idea of severely disabled people trekking across the country and interviewing people for their \"news\" show seems kind of depressing. While many people talk to the reporters, others are jerks and ignore them. Yet through scene after scene, the spirit of the cast will warm your heart. The people in this film are truly inspiring. Plus, it's funny as hell ! Best documentary I've seen since \"I'm from Hollywood.\"",
