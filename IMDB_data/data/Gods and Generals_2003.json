        "reviewBody": "I attended at screening of Gods and Generals this weekend and was very pleased with the movie as a whole. From reading the previous comments, I can understand if some viewers were miffed due to the length of the film and the attention it required to appreciate it. It helps greatly if one has some knowledge of the Civil War and American History in general. Reading the novel would help. The battle scenes were top notch and the main characters (Jackson, Lee, Chamberlain) were well acted. For the viewers with an interest in history, I'm sure the 3 hours and 49 minutes went very quickly. I will anxiously await both the complete 6 hour version on DVD and the final part of the trilogy, Last Full Measure. Good companion to the previous film, Gettysburg. This is not a film for casual movie audiences looking for cheap thrills and mindless action. Keep an open mind and get ready to experience life in the 1860's."
