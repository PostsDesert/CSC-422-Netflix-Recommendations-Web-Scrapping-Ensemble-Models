        "reviewBody": "\"Mojave Moon\" is a film fueled on the magic of a full moonlit night. It has a distinct, memorable and charming presence. I love this very feel of the film, but unfortunately it wares off as the movie tries to reinvent itself at the end. It shifts into a different mood, from a sweet romance into a wacky, cartoonish comedy. \n\n Danny Aiello is a genuine actor, and his best work is in his little indie films like this. He plays a used carsalesman named Al, who is lost in a routine life. One day a beautiful free spirit (Angelina Jolie) serves as an outlet as he follows her into the Mojave Desert for a mysterious adventure.\n\n The premise is almost identical to \"Box of Moon Light\", a far better film. Both films are about a person serving as a way out of the deadly foe of time. If only \"Mojave Moon\" centered itself more on the wonderful magic of the journey and the life-changing outcomes like \"BOM\", instead of becoming untrue to itself. (Ironically both main characters are named Al)."
