Kids, go out and rent Mesmer, and get ready to be mesmer-ized by his sexy, non-magical charms.\n\nThere is a bit of magic in this movie, though, so Harry Potter fans will get a kick out of it when they go back and rent it to see Alan in a pre-Snape role. He plays an unorthodox physician who get pretty amazing results out of his patients, and when other doctors catch on to what he's doing, they call him any number of names from magician to charlatan. It's ironic that the women he comes across are far more interested in his methods than the men, and that more often than not, they're attracted to him more than his skill. Still, with his gorgeous '90s hairstyle and his affective way of talking, why would they be attracted to him? Ladies, rent this period piece romance. It might seem a little dated, but it's one of his yummiest roles. If he healed your panic attacks, wouldn't you have a crush on him, too?",
