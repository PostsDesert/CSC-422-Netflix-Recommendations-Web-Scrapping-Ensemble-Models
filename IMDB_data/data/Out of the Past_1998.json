The quest for human rights is a natural instinct within us all, as this film demonstrates.\n\nWhat a liberating thought that, after centuries of ignorance, fear, superstition and intolerance, some of the last vestiges of discrimination are neutralizing.\n\nThe phenomenon is the result of \"accelerating acceleration\"--a momentum that speeds itself up as it accumulates more energy. In this case, the force comes from the people, as more and more hands join to unite in harmony.\n\n\"Out of the Past\" is a touching mini-documentary on a significant topic which involves us all. Well conceived and executed, it makes its statement in an intelligent and moving manner. ###",
