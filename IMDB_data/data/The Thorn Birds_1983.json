        "reviewBody": "Upon my initial viewings, this moved me. It is an emotionally charged drama of forbidden love, scandal and tragedy that teaches a very powerful lesson...that we, as a human race, are all doomed to destruction, each generation repeating the mistake of the one before (remember Rev. Jim Jones himself said \"those who cannot remember history are doomed to repeat it\").\n\nThis miniseries was the Australian outback's answer to \"Gone With The Wind\". Only this time it's Cardinal DeBricissart (Richard Chamberlin) that's the Scarlett O'Hara and Meggie Cleary (Rachel Ward) that's the Rhett Butler. And yes, it cries for a sequel that can never be made. And yes, not all love stories have happy endings.\n\nAnd there are some sequences that do not depend on a music score, such as the touching climactic scene with Meggie and Justine in the barn.\n\nBut that's just what makes a miniseries a classic. This is not some cheap-skate adaptation of a best selling book...this is the way novels should be made."
