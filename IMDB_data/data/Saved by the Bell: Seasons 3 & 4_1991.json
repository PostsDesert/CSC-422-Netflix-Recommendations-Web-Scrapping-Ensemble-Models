Zack wasn't that cute in the early episodes, but got a lot more good-looking later on. Kelly - oh she was pretty! A little airheaded in some episodes, and totally brain-dead in the two dumping-Zack ones (The Last Dance and The Aftermath) but she was a nice girl. Jessie was NOT annoying or obsessed about grades. She turned down a chance to go to Stansbury, remember? Slater was a bit of a dumb jock, but he was the one who was really clever in Driver's Ed. Lisa was kind of shallow (she kept track of how many hours they had to shop for prom dresses!) but hey. And Screech - who could forget Screech! He was nerdy but lovable - popping out of dustbins some of the time, hiding in filing cabinets, being a pineapple princess, getting stuffed into 82 lockers...he was hilarious."
