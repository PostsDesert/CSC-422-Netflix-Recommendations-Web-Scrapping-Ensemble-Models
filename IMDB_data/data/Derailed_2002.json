When in a train happens strange events Jean Claude is helped by a thief spy ( Laura Harring ).\n\nThey'll have confront a villain(Tomas Arana) and henchmen who have obtained a lethal virus. In the confrontation the virus outbreaks originating the nightmare .\n\nThe runtime film is adjusted : one hour and sixty minutes approx. , it's fast moving and enough bemusing .\n\nFrom the beginning to the end the action is unstoppable.\n\nIn the motion picture there are suspense, emotions, shootouts, pursuits but with little budget , it's a B series movie with less money than Van Damme's previous films .\n\nThe storyline is similarly written two films of the 70s and 90s : ¨Cassandra Crossing ( by George Pan Cosmatos )¨and ¨Under Siege 2 ¨ ( Geoff Murphy ), it rips off both movies.\n\nThe picture is produced by 777 Films which is Van Damme's property. Also by ¨ Millenniun ¨ the production company in charge of Avi Lerner, Danny Lerner, Boaz Davison and Trevor Short who are making a lot of films in the 90s and 2000s, likeness to ¨Cannon¨(Menahem Golan and Yoran Globus) in the 80s.\n\nThe flick will appeal to Van Damme enthusiast and action fans.\n\nRating: 5/10 average",
