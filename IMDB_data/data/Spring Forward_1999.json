        "reviewBody": "\"Spring Forward\" has the same limited resources as most indie films but applies them intelligently for maximum effect. The story, a simple male bonding tale about a couple of Parks Dept maintenance men, leapfrogs through the New England seasons as the all-conversation male musings and reflections take the entire run fleshing out the characters so well we'd like to have them to dinner by film's end. Those looking for escapist entertainment should pass on this flick. However, those interested in a character-driven film about what it is to be male shouldn't miss it. Kudos! (B+)",
