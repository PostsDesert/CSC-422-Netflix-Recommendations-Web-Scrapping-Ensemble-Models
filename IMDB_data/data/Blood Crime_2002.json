Not enough to make me quit watching, though.\n\nThis is one of those movies made with American stars in New Zealand or Australia, but the action is supposed to be taking place somewhere in the United States. In this movie, it's the American Northwest.\n\nHowever, the rest of the cast are actors from New Zealand or Australia, so they have to fake an American accent. Some actors are better at this than others.\n\nOften the faked American accent fails when the actor is required to yell a line. Whatever, it's really, really distracting.\n\nJust a complaint, that's all. As I said, I enjoyed this movie nevertheless."
