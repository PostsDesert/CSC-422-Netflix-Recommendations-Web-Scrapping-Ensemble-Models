        "reviewBody": "What can you say about a movie that touches your heart & soul? Both @Nikki DeLoach & Brennan Elliott flexed their acting muscles as well as their inner emotions to bring a story of a church grief support experiencing varying stages of grief. Both were exemplary, but it was Brennan Elliott's character, Michael, the leader of the support group who gave an award deserving performance as someone who has masked his grief, whether through denial or pain, and instead puts on a brave front to assist the other group members. Both he & Nikki DeLoach, as well as the supporting cast showed the struggles of pain, anger, denial, and remorse while going through the grief process with the thread of their Christian faith sustaining their journey. This was a welcome departure from the usual formulaic rom-com Christmas Hallmark movies. Most of us have experienced some form of grief in our lives. The Gift of Peace might be the best produced & acted Hallmark movie I've ever seen. Have your tissues handy and find the faith, joy, and hope this movie offers during a season that can be difficult for many who have suffered a loss in their life.",
