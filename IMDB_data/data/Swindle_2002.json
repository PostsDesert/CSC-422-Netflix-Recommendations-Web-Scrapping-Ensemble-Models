        "reviewBody": "$windle is a cool, funky movie I landed on by accident watching TV, when I couldn't fall asleep. I was instantly captivated and entertained by the large number of clich√©s. I guess it was all tongue in cheek from the get go as far as cop shows roll. I love cop shows. For those of you who can read between the lines, and love CSI,loved Snatch, it would seem like this unpretentious flick could be one of the precursors to the CSI genre. A borderline cheesy cult B movie made in 2002, starring Tom Sizemore (Natural Born Killers) and an semi-serious performance by comedian Dave Foley (Kids In The Hall)I don't want to create anticipation or spoil the plot. It's light weight in a fun way.\n\nI wish there were more of those movies around in 2010, to pad those sleepless nights, zapping through infomercials. We love the cheese, so I can't wait to see another cop show by KC Bascombe. On a final note, I really loved the music score throughout, and had to go and find that El Camino song by E.P. Bergen that now plays on my I Pod all the time.",
