The documentary is extremely captivating. It lasts 3 hours and it manages to grab the viewer's attention and hold it without letting it go. The movie is simply too brisk to become boring in such a short period. It displays an immense amount of photographs and videos, accompanied by educational and insightful comments from direct witnesses, authors, and various photographic experts. I highly recommend you to take this journey through history - you will not regret it."
