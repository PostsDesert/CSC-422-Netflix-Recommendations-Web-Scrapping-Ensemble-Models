The way that these guys pick up girls, leave a message on their machine is now completely obsolete! Mobile phones - text messages have come in to play. If this movie were to be an accurate representation of the pick up scene these days it'd have to be remade. I guess there are some things that never change though (always double down on 11, well almost always :P) P.S. I made these observations after watching swingers whilst drinking a few beers and proceeding to go to a bar, try to pull out some 'money' lines and f*ck up any chances I had with many beautiful babies. I just decide to keep drinking and here I am, at home, writing pointless comments on IMDb, oh well..."
