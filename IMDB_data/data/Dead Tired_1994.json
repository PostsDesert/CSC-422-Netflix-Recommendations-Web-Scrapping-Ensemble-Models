His friend Carole Bouquet decides to help him and they find his perfect double Patrick Olivier in the countryside of France. Patrick accepts minor jobs posing of Michel Blanc and when the farce is disclosed, he offers to replace Michel Clanc while he enjoys vacation. When Michel Blanc returns, he cannot prove who he is. \n\n\"Grosse fatigue\" is a cult French comedy with the cameo and minor participation of famous people from the cinema industry including Roman Polanski. The storyline is original but the humor is unfunny, suitable only for French audiences. My vote is five.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Estressad√≠ssimo\" (\"Under Great Stress\")",
