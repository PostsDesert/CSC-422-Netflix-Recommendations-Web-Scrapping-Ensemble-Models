        "reviewBody": "A famous gunfighter (John Wayne) is wounded in crossfire and a quaker family cares him and heals . During recuperation the daughter named Penelope Worth (Gail Russell) has a romance and falls in love for him . She eventually humanizing the gunslinger . And he has to choose between his violent world or the pacifist existence in which Penelope Worth lives . Meanwhile , he'll have to confront a malicious ringleader (Bruce Cabot) and his henchmen . \n\nThis well-handled production is a thoughtful Western but with average budget . By time this western was popular with the public . The film has rider pursuits , stampedes , shootouts , struggles and an agreeable love story . John Wayne gives one of the best interpretations of his long career . Bruce Cabot as Wayne's friend has an important and well featured role , he's habitual in his films . Gail Russell shined in the role as Penelope and provided a great acting . Rare and enjoyable beauty , she was to be groomed one of Paramout's top stars , but the alcohol took her and she was found dead and it attributed to the drinking . Gail was only 36 years old . Had it not been for the alcohol , Gail's career could have been one of the biggest . Besides , there appears Harry Carey Sr. as a tough sheriff , Carey was a veteran actor who played numerous Western . The motion picture is finely directed by the Wayne's usual screenwriter named James Edward Grant . There's also a lousy version in computer-colored . The flick will appeal to John Wayne fans and Western moviegoers . Rating : Nice and well worth watching .",
