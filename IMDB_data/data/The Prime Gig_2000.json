I thought this movie had a good premise and that the actiing was fine(although not stellar). The thing that bothers me about this movie was the ending...it left too many unanswered questions....to many unknowns....It is good for a bored night when u don't have anything else to do but don't ask questions after it's over because they will be unanswered and unknown...big dissappointment. Overall decent movie but not great. if you can see it for free like I did...it's not a bad way to spend an hour and a half if not...wait till it comes on cable"
