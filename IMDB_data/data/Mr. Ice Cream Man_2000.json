I really related to this kid the whole way through. But how could I not??? THIS MOVIE HAS IT ALL! I thought Friday the 13th part VII was good but BOY was I in for a shock! This is by far the greatest horror film of all time! Evil DeadII hath no competition for this FEATURE FILM. The cinematography: ruled. The acting: superb. The writing: intriguing. Buy this film. Own this DVD. Steal this VHS anything to get your hands on the glorious, soon to be sequeled, Mr. Ice Cream Man. You'll never eat a poptart the same way again.",
