The characters however, look different from what I imagined in the book. Still, Mark and Bryon made things interesting both in the book and the movie. A lot of the other characters, such as Cathy, M&M, Charlie, Angela, and the shepherd brothers also made the movie and the book interesting, especially near the end."
