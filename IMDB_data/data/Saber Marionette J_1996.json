        "reviewBody": "Awesome intro and outro songs, good Marionette design, usual excellent job by Megumi Hayashibara (the reason I got here in the first place) and good voice acting from the other actresses and actors, this show it's entertaining enough if you can close an eye on the evident plot holes and two eyes on the atrocious otaku-tailored sexist overtones behind it, albeit you see the male protagonist being saved by one of his companions at least once so that's a plus. The only interesting conceptual glimpse you might find in this one is that machines can evolve if an human (of course, of male sex since men are stupidly supposed to be the ones always in control of everything. Whatever) loves them, but other than there is no real deeper meaning to be found. Watch once especially if you're a Megumi Hayashibara fan, than move on to something better.",
