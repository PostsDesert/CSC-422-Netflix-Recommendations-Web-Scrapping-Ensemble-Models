        "reviewBody": "This series by Alexis Sayle is probably one of the best series from the early 90s. An imaginative look at Eurpoe in the 20s and 30s that is both pretty precise but also very funny. Blackadder was a kind of diluted version whereas this directly lampooned the political intrigues of the early 20th century instead of just laughing at fart jokes. Who can forget such unforgettable lines as \"A German fascist? Well, I never!\" What about the performance by Windsor Davis as the repressed homosexual Masquerading as a butch butcher and \"Ernest Hemmingbeck\" fan. Definitely his best cameo role. Not forgetting Neil Morrissey as his sidekick, Rochet and the hilarious Alan Corduner as the tortured music teacher suffering at the voice box of Mme Ovary. Why the hell isn't this available on DVD? Pure genius!",
