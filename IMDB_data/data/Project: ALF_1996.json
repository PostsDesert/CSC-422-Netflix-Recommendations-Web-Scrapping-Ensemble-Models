The bits that ALF is in are good and are worth watching , especially when he is having the tests. The rest is not worth watching.Kids of the younger age would like this and thats about the best i can say about this film. What on earth was Martin Sheen thinking about when he took on this role? from Apocolypse Now to Project Alf!!!! 6 out of 10",
