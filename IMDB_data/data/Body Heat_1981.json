        "reviewBody": "Body Heat is writer Lawrence Kasden's very successful directorial debut.\n\nWilliam Hurt is a lawyer who is drawn into a plot by Kathleen Turner to get rid of her slimy husband Richard Crenna.\n\nThe acting in this film is outstanding. Relatively unknown at the time Mickey Rourke gives a startling performance in a small role and Ted Danson, before-Cheers, is outstanding as Hurt's lawyer friend. The best performance is by Richard Crenna, an exceptional actor who never got the recognition he deserved. I try to see any film with Crenna in it just to watch him. Young and sexy Kathleen Turner's husky-voiced Matty is hot, hot hot! \n\nIf you like to be surprised this is the film for you. Body Heat is a classic thriller that pays homage to the film noir movies of the 1940s. It looks good, the music is great and Kathleen Turner is hot, hot, hot!\n\nYou'll be extremely surprised at how intelligent and well-made this film is."
