        "reviewBody": "Sometime soon we'll agree not to be mad at the French. When that happens, look for \"Les Visiteurs\" on cable or at the video place. The frantic humor of this time-shifting comedy works well both on the French dialogue track and through the somewhat loose paraphrases of the subtitles. Yes, folks, subtitles and all, this is a good one.\n\nChristian Clavier emerged from the Splendide, a French take on Second City, to seize the film comedy market by the throat. Like Jerry Lewis, he is in need of a straight man. Lewis's moved on to the Ding-a-Ling Sisters. Clavier has granite-faced Jean Reno of \"French Kiss\" and \"Mission Impossible\", the man with the permanent dix-sept heures shadow across his jowls. Their interaction is spot-on hilarious.\n\nOddly, the memorable quote from this film is in (sort of) English. \"OK\" is acceptable Franglais, the Academie notwithstanding. Clavier's character becomes fascinated with the word, shouting \"O-Kayyy\"! at the least provocation. Listen to my wife and I converse: we echo old Jacqouille all the time."
