        "reviewBody": "With three appealing stars and a silly but interesting story, this is an enjoyable light comedy that moves at a good pace and makes you feel at home with its offbeat characters. Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Shirley Temple all get plenty to work with, as each of their characters is pretty well-suited to their talents. They make their characters believably flawed and engaging at the same time.\n\nThe story makes it clear early on that it should not be taken too seriously, yet it is told well enough that it is easy to set aside any plausibility issues. The early misadventures set up the amusing arrangement that the judge (Loy) agrees to, in the hopes of keeping the others out of trouble, and this in turn sets up a new series of outlandish events. Harry Davenport and Ray Collins head up a pretty good supporting cast, and the situation builds pretty well, leading up to a complicated, entertaining set of tangle-ups.\n\nWhile there is nothing remarkable about it, \"The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer\" is the kind of pleasant silliness that takes the right touch to make it work. It makes for an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half."
