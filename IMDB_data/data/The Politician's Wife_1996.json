        "reviewBody": "Brilliant performance from Juliet Stevenson in this tale of betrayal and revenge, also amazing work from Trevor Eve as the errant, conscienceless husband and embryo Prime Minister. Juliet as the wife could have forgiven and forgotten had it not been for the damning evidence given to her that she uses to feed her revenge. And this is revenge of the best kind. Not the clothes cutting, brick throwing revenge of a tempestuous hothead but a calculating scheme that hits the target where it hurts the most. She is aided in this from an unlikely source but also gains the help of others through guile and charm making them unwitting allies in her plan. And you are totally on her side. A triumphant experience.!!!",
