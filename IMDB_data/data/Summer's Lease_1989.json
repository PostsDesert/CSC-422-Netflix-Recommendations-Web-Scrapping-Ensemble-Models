        "reviewBody": "John Mortimer has a slightly wicked sense of humour, well demonstrated in this superbly written and acted work. Not likely to be enjoyed by the non-literate or younger adult, but a treasure for the middle-aged parent. Humor, conflict, sex and mystery are all here in pleasing proportion.\n\nGielgud plays a randy, pseudo-socialist grandfather. His character and lines allow him to steal the show. Susan Fleetwood as mother and grandaughter gives a standout performance as well, overshadowed only by Gielgud's wonderful material and skills.\n\nGreat television is alive and doing well in Britain. It is sad that so few people have had a chance to see this work. It appears to be unavailable for purchase. Those fortunate enough to have made a copy when it ran on PBS, please share it with your friends.",
