        "reviewBody": "\"Donovan's Reef\" is set on an island in the Pacific, which is basically getting by on its own merits without much contact with the modern world. John Wayne and Lee Marvin team up to portray two navy buddies that seem to have two things in common--the same birthday and a desire to punch each others' lights out because of a quarrel that started several years before on that birthday. The rest of the cast occupy themselves trying to keep the two \"friends\" alive because they genuinely are decent guys.\n\nInto this island bliss comes Elizabeth Allen, portraying a lady from Boston who is attempting to prove that her father, played by Jack Warden, has been living on the island in standards less than acceptable by Boston customs so she can claim his share of a family shipping business. Through one scene after another, the film takes a merry romp through its plot and gives the viewer a very enjoyable time.",
