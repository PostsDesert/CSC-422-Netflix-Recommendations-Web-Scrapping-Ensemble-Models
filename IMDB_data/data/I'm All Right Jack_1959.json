I have been in a Union business that failed before, and I was quite shocked at how much I could compare my own experiences with what was on display here with the Unions and Management trying to maneuver themselves ahead of on another. While Peter Sellers does put on a great performance, this really is Ian Carmichael's movie. I hadn't seen any of his work, and this was a great introduction. All of the other cast is great as well. One final note, it probably contains the most annoyingly catchy title song ever, it'll probably haunt your cranium for days.",
