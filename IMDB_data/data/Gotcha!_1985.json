If those that have seen it did not notice, but this movie can pretty much be single handedly thanked for PAINTBALL. In fact when the movie came out they even had the Gotcha Guns, which was pitched by quarterback Jim McMahon. The game was played by Anthony edwards(E.R, Top Gun) and his friends around college, they each had a id card and were assigned a person to kill, honestly I thought it to be a great idea that could be a lot of fun.so everyone that is out there playing paintball every weekend which I am sure there are a lot of you, thank this movie. If you are a fan of the 80's this is a definite must see.",
