        "reviewBody": "The #1 reason why I love brainless action movies from the 80s and 90s? Because of the actors playing the bad guys! Just look at this baby; - Jack Palance, Brion James, Robert Z'dar, Clint Howard... Sure enough, the stars of the film are Sly Stallone and Kurt Russell, but for people who always root for the villains - like me - films like \"Tango & Cash\" are delightful! The set-up for this buddy-action movie is that the two best cops of Los Angeles are framed by big-shot drug/weapon dealer Palance, and end up in prison amidst the vengeful cons they locked away themselves. Plausibility and coherence are of minor importance, but \"Tango & Cash\" works perfectly because both Stallone and Russell prove themselves to be masters of self-parody, and the chemistry between them is awesome. Good stunt work, James Bond like gadgetry and an incredibly sexy Yazoo-dance by Teri Hatcher only make the film even more amusing.",
