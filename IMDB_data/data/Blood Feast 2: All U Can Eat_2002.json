        "reviewBody": "H.G. Lewis (the wizard of gore) made this film as a sequel to his classic \"Blood Feast.\" Before this film came out, I though good old H.G. was in retirement somewhere just biding his time. I'm glad that I was wrong. Most of H.G.'s older films were pretty shocking in their day, but are merely campy by today's standards. Blood Feast 2 plays off of the campiness of his films, but doesn't become annoying like so many other films would.\n\nThe plot is that Fuad Ramses III opens up a catering business in his grandfather's old shop (the villain in Blood Feast). He becomes possessed by the evil goddess Ishtar. He is hired by a bitchy socialite to cater her daughters wedding. Ramses begins butchering the bride's maids to fulfill his contract.\n\nMost of the humor is tongue in cheek and a little juvenile, but it fits the overall mood of the film rather well.\n\nFor H.G. Lewis fans (those who haven't seen it) it is well worth the price of renting it.",
