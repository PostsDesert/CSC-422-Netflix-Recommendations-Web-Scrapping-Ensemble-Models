As he guides a group of juvenile delinquents, the camp is in danger of being lost to a mining company. Undeterred, Ernest sets out to save the camp from destruction. The late Jim Varney was great as the klutzy but well-meaning Ernest P. Worrell. The late John Vernon did well as Sherman Krader, the corrupt mining company owner. This enjoyable movie is filled with slapstick humor and physical comedy."
