Lead actor DeCarlo couldn't have done a better job as an obnoxious, yet fun to like mafia soldier. Hale Storm Entertainment has had mostly hits for members of the LDS faith, but this film soars passed their previous efforts and delivers a film that appeals to one and all and does not limit itself to members of the LDS church. That is what is so wonderful about this particular installment. The story is about the outside folks, looking in on a very peculiar community. It's a message about getting along and living together as neighborhood and community, not a dogma based preachy film.",
