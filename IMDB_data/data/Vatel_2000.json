It's one of the few that I have to re-watch, every so often.\n\nNow, one of the things that struck me most strongly was the fact of Vatel and Anne's goodness -- this, in spite of where Louis' example might have led them -- with the people who worked with them.\n\nThe scenes with Vatel and Colin; with Anne and Louise... especially the one where Louise drops the vase that Vatel sent to Anne (and Anne says \"It's alright, Louise... it's alright\") ... these are made almost painfully beautiful by the contrasting scenes with the aristocrats running amok.\n\nBut, Vatel's words come back to me here: \"Harmony and Contrast -- All beauty comes from those two things\".",
