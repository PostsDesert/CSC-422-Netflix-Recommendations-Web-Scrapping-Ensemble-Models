        "reviewBody": "This excellent video is done in two parts. The first three songs are from the 1983 performance on Austin City Limits and they are excellent. Stevie Ray rocks all out on \"Pride and Joy\", \"Texas Flood\", and the Jimi Hendrix cover of \"Voodoo Chile (Slight Return)\" (only SRV could do the latter song justice).\n\nThe songs from the 1989 show are, \"The House Is Rockin\", \"Tightrope\", \"Leave My Little Girl Alone\", \"Cold Shot\", \"Crossfire\", and \"Riviera Paradise\". \"Leave My Little Girl Alone\" is the blues at its very best. Stevie Ray plays the guitar with such passion. \"Riviera Paradise\" is a great jazz flavored instrumental. I think it's awesome. The keyboard part reminds me of something that Lyle Mays with the Pat Metheny Group would play. Really nice.\n\nAlso included at the end of the video disc is a montage video of 'Little Wing', this is the Jimi Hendrix song that SRV covered which was previously unreleased. The video is awesome as it shows rare footage with SRV and several blues greats including BB King, T-Bone Walker, Albert Collins, Hendrix, Big Bill Broonzy, Leadbelly, Eric Clapton,and more.\n\nAll in all, this is an excellent collection of SRV songs. A must have for the SRV fan.",
