The soundtrack and images are beautiful, and I feel the way the story is built fits perfectly. It is very informative, and many experts and archeological sites are visited as well.\n\nThe narration isn't modern, but it works with the topic of the documentary, frankly I like the style better compared to contemporary documentaries, and reminds me a bit of the narration in the documentary Stalingrad from 2003.\n\nWho were these mysterious Egyptians? And what do they mean to us still? You will see.",
