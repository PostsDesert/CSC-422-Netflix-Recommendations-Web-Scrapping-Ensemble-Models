        "reviewBody": "Just watched this movie. I definitely recommend it to anyone familiar with asian movies and to a lesser degree to anyone else. \"Typical\" movie goers might be slightly dissapointed though I think this movie had enough aspects that would please a wider audience then just asian movie lovers.\n\nIt's about a female spy who takes a job at Burger King to wait for her \"target\", a regular customer. The boys from the school next door all fall in love with her. One of them even devotes a webpage for her on his friends site that seems to offer a collection of the hottest girls in town. Unfortunately, this puts her mission in danger and she ends up dating the guy in order to make him delete the pictures of her.\n\nThough the premise is pretty far fetched it works charmingly well. But it could have worked so much better. The movie can't decide if it's a romantic comedy or a spy comedy. What makes the movie stand out is the acting especially from the lead actress, whose charming presence adds quite a lot to the appeal of the movie.",
