It was probably this film where Woody Allen saw Mariel for the first time, before casting her 3 years later as his girlfriend in 'Manhattan' (1979). I would love to hear the story about how THIS became the script that introduced the ladies to Hollywood.\n\nThe shots of Los Angeles are great, the Hemingway girls are beautiful, and the film is intense throughout.\n\nRealReview Posting Scoring Criteria: Acting - 1/1; Casting - 1/1; Directing - 1/1; Story - 1/1; Writing/Screenplay - 1/1;\n\nTotal Base Score = 5\n\nModifiers (+ or -): Standout Performances: 1 ( Mariel Hemingway );\n\nTotal RealReview Rating: 6",
