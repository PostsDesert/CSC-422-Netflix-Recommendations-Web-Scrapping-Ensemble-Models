        "reviewBody": "Emmanuelle on Taboo Island has absolutely nothing to do with the Emanuelle series - it's just another attempt to pass a Laura Gemser film off as an Emanuelle film in order to sell it. I've got no problem with this in theory and indeed some of the 'fake' Emanuelle films (fake rip-offs of rip-offs could only be made in Italy) are very good - but that is not the case here, as Emmanuelle on Taboo Island is really very boring. The plot takes the familiar idea of a man being washed up on a desert island. He turns up on an island (presumably called 'Taboo Island') and soon falls in love with a native, played by Laura Gemser; but this doesn't go down too well with the girl's family. There's really nothing to recommend this film for - even the fact that Gemser spends most of the film naked isn't a good reason to see it. The plot is very boring and no attempt is made to spice things up, which is a shame for the audience. It all basically just drones on - we are not even given any reason to care for the characters - until we reach the ending, which really couldn't come soon enough. This film might be of interest to hardcore Laura Gemser fans; but everyone else had best stay clear of it.",
