Instead, it uses the clips to tie together cooking segments where the kids make some easy food dishes with supervision from a Muppet genie that came from the titular magic cookbook, Alan ('zapped' over from Hooper's Store for his appearance), and the celebrity guests.\n\nFor the adults, the video has a couple of great running gags and two celebrity appearances -- Emeril Legasse, who makes pizza with the kids and talks about where cheese comes from, and singer Heather Headley, who teaches the kids about pocket foods and makes a summer roll for Elmo to try.",
