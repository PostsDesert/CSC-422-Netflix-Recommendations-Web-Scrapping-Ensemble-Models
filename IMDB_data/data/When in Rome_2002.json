        "reviewBody": "I have seen most of the Olsen films, and in my opinion, the movies they have made when they were younger were better than their later movies. Generally because they were younger then, so the plots looked cuter to the audience. But now, the movies are rather immature and very unrealistic, viewers can't identify the plots with real life.\n\nMy comment on When In Rome goes the same for all of their later movies. The characters they portray are almost always 'perfect'-beautiful, smart, trendy, well-off- as if all of us in real life are perfect. Why can't they play more stereotypical roles who fight in life to overcome their flaws? Also, they always meet boys in every place they go who automatically likes them. And what's queer is that, the boys always come in pairs, be they brothers, friends, etc. Also, the conflicts in the plots are solved rather easily and most of the conflicts are lame.\n\nNow that they are older, they might want to make some differences in their movie making, such as starring in separate movies, more intelligent plots, things like that. Honestly, if they continue with their own way of making movies, they're gonna get nowhere. Note: These are my own opinions, and this is a free country."
