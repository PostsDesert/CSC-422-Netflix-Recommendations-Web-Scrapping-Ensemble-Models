The TOTP performances and short promos that did make it on, sum up the Smiths in a beautiful fashion. Morrissey's performances is beautiful and camp and sexy as well as a bit stiff and self conscious in the uniquely ridiculous way that fits as a contrary to the harsh reality and truth of his emotional lyrics. - Especially in the Heaven Knows I'm Miserable now TOTP performance. \n\nI guarantee that fans of the Smiths will be prompted to worship Morrissey, Marr, Rourke and Joyce even more. Buy it now :)"
