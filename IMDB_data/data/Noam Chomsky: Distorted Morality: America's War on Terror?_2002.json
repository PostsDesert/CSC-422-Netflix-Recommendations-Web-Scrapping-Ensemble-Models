For its content its dynamite, that its been made available on DVD is highly praiseable. Not that I think others than those already familiar with Chomsky would have a look at it, but if they did I cant see how they could fail to see how horribly wrong the American foreign (in this case) politics are and have been since Truman dropped the A, through to the bleak Reagan period of the eighties, the Bushes and also Bill Clinton who was no angel at all. Its not fun to learn this, but there is time to be serious and time to relax. Now the time to do something is highly overdue."
