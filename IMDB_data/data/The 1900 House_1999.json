I grabbed it without even really knowing what it was about, so I was very pleasantly surprised.\n\nIt was fun to see them reworking the house, by removing portions of walls and appliances, and making awesome discoveries behind it! I appreciated the efforts and research measures they took in remodeling and redecorating. I learned quite a bit more then what I was expecting. There can be so much that one does not expect or take into consideration (Example: The reason's for all the Inspectors concerns).\n\nIt was hilarious to see some of the reactions from family members when they were confronted by things they had not anticipated, LOL!! That's the way it is with so many things in life (Example: We many times have no idea everything that a person is responsible for in a job/position, until we do it ourselves).\n\nThe most valuable thing this film produced, was stated beautifully about taking care what we 'romanticize'. We human beings have great tendencies to do that. NO, the grass is NOT always greener somewhere else!",
