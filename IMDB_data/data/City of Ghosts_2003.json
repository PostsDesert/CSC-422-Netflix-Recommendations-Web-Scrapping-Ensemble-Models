        "reviewBody": "Matt Dillon has, in my mind, put together the single most Original Screenplay I have seen in 12 years. \"City Of Ghosts\" is the kind of movie that we need many more of. Go to this movie with THE EXPECTATION OF BEING INCREDIBLY ENTERTAINED AND IMMERSED IN A FANTASTIC STORY IN AN EXOTIC LAND. 1st of all, The story here is Incredibly interesting and grabs you from the very beginning. Man looking for Boss who has potentially used him to front for a 10 Million dollar insurance scam over hurricane victims homes. Ah, but there is sooo much more to it than that. Next, the acting is so fantastic that this movie immediately conjures up Images and memories of a vaguely similar yet far INFERIOR film, \"The Killing Fields\". Finally, this movie is shot on Location in Both Bangkok Thailand and Cambodia making for an incredibly Original film experience for North American audiences. I have never liked Gerard Depardieu in a single thing he has done but he SHINES and is without a doubt Fantastic here as a Disgruntled Hotel Operator in Phnom Pen. Of all of the movies I have seen in the Past 12 years, this was the Single Most Original and Matt Dillon has, weather anyone likes it or not, created a social masterpiece with a message that is so relevant in today's world it needs to be required viewing for people all over the world !!! Most importantly the message of this movie has to do with what it Really is To be RICH in the TRUE sense of the word. Something sorely missing from most of today's consciousness. !!!"
