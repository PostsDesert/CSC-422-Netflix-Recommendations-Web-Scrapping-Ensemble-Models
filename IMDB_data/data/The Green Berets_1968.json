        "reviewBody": "I found the film quite enjoyable and have always enjoyed John Wayne movies in general. There were some noticeable technical glitches in the movie that could have been avoided. Maybe the budget wasn't much. Still, one can easily overlook the problems for the sake of enjoying the movie. The attack on the \"A\" camp was epic in proportion and really draws you in.\n\nNow, with that being said, I would like to speak a bit to the political implications of the film. First, comments from someone not from the United States and who probably wasn't ever in Southeast Asia are just so much tripe in my opinion. There are many \"armchair quarterbacks\" out there that have all the answers. The film makes an honest attempt to illicit the patriotism needed at that time. Everybody loves to bash on the U.S. about Viet Nam. How about the Falklands.... South Africa.... Ireland?"
