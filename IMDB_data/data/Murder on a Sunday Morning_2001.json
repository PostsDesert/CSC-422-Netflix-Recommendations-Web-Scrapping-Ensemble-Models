        "reviewBody": "You know, before seeing this film I had little sympathy for those caught up in criminal cases. I mean if they were arrested and charged, \"they must have been guilty\" I reasoned?\n\nI formed this opinion over some years. You see a good friend of mine once worked as a detective in some of the more seedy areas of Sydney. He frequently complained that his policing efforts were wasted due to 'bleeding heart' lawyers and magistrates. He would \"bang the crooks up in the morning and they would be \"back on the street by noon\". It took its toll... they wore him down. He quit.\n\nHe has argued since, not unreasonably I thought, that creative evidence gathering, to keep the baddies \"where they belong\", was... well... \"acceptable\". \n\nMy arguments about the rights of innocent people weren't valid he claimed. \"What are the chances that you will ever be arrested and charged with a serious crime\"? he would argue. And, being a law abiding citizen, the weight of his argument convinced me he was right. The chances of me, or any of my family or friends, being charged with murder or a serious offense were zero to none I thought. \n\nHmmmmm. Well as mentioned earlier, seeing this wonderfully enlightening documentary changed all that. \n\nI'm sending him a copy.",
