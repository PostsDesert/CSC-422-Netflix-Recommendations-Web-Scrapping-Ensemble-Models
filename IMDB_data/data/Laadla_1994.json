        "reviewBody": "This is one of my all time favourite Sridevi movies, because she is not playing the normal heroine. Sri excelles in showing how Indian women can be successful business woman and not just a woman running around trees, she leaves that to Raveena Tandon.\n\nShe looks damn good, apart from the one song in which she wears an awful silver outfit, and made an excellent job of taking over Divya Bharti's performance. As normal she works well with Anil Kapoor. The music is good, but the only draw back of this film is the ending. I think it could have been done better.\n\nThis is not the usuall run of the mill film, and it left a lot of young impressionable teenagers saying,\"You understand, you better understand.\"\n\nAnil Kapoor plays the sentimental Laadla, and the mind games between him and Sri are a treat to watch. This is Sridevi like you have never seen her before!",
