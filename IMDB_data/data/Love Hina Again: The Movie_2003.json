        "reviewBody": "Love Hina was funny partly because it was random. Love Hina Again takes this idea and throws it into the pit of hell.\n\nLove Hina Again is 3 episodes, is completely mindless, makes no sense and contributes nothing to the original show. It has some of the classic gags from the first, with poor Kentaro's male instincts coming along with punishment from the insanity of Haruko & Co., but that's not enough to keep Love Hina Again afloat.\n\nGood for a few laughs, but if you're looking for content, forget it. If you enjoy the humor of Love Hina, move on to something new like Golden Boy. This series has been worn out.\n\n5/10",
