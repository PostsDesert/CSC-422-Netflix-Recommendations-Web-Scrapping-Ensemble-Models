        "reviewBody": "I thought this movie would be like the average TV Movie, but a good performance by Regina King, and the uniqueness of having a deaf star character put it over the top. Ms. Matlin plays (Dana Lacy) a deaf woman and campaign leader who is put on trial for the murder of her employer, Senatorial Candidate Sander Morgan. Regina King plays Ronnie, her (Female Johnny Cochran) lawyer who has never lost a case. This film has a Memphis setting, so it is comparable to John Grisham books. This movie has a surprise twist ending, and it kept me interested until the final second. I would give this movie a B+.It is not as good as Grisham, but good enough.",
