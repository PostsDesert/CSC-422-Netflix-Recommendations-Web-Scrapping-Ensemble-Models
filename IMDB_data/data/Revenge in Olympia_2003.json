This is the third Olympia movie, and if you've seen the other two, you know these are just plain bad! This Maxwell guy really needs to stop writing and get another job. He's killing the cinematic experience. Did the director read this at all? What were the actors thinking? Why did they all do it????? One word, they were all desperate for a job no doubt in the entertainment industry.",
