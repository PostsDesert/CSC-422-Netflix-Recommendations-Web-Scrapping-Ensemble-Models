I really tried to enjoy the movie but the dialogue was so so slow, tiresome and the acting was an embarrassment. I've never had to put so much effort to pay attention to a movie. I actually found myself contemplating going to the gym. I haven't gone to the gym in a year. After siting on the couch with little to none entertainment, I had to force myself off the couch and do some stretching to remind myself I am still alive. Without constant snacking, this movie will cause you question if you're dying. \n\nThe only reason I watched the remaining of the movie was because of the dog, also the only reason i gave this movie a rating of 2 stars. Unless you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep I advise you don't put yourself through the pain of watching this movie.",
