He normally wants to watch movies with the \"good guys\" battling the \"bad guys\", but he chooses this movie over those most of the time. \n\nThe actors chosen to voice the characters are perfect for their roles. I especially enjoy Tom Bosley as the shopkeeper and David Hyde Pierce as the cuckoo. I also appreciate the idea of home being where ever there are people who love each other. I would recommend it highly to anyone with children.",
