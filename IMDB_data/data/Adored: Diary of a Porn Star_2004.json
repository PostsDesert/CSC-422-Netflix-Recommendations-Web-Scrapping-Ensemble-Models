        "reviewBody": "I went to see this film at a film festival recently only because my gay guy friend wanted to see it in hopes of seeing some hot, naked Italians. However, the film proved to be surprisingly serious and not nearly as cheesy as anticipated. There was no full nudity (but plenty of cheesecake to look at for those who want it). I thought the story was really quite sweet though. It focused on the reunion of 30-year old Riki with his estranged brother. His brother learns that Riki is both gay and a famous porn star. Although he is initially horrified, he learns to look past it and love his brother despite his career. Its not nearly as cheesy as it sounds. The film is both funny and sad, addressing the humor inherent in the cheesy porno business as well as the loneliness experienced by this star who is lusted after by millions but loved by no one. I give it an 8 of 10 for being funny, sweet, sad and different.",
