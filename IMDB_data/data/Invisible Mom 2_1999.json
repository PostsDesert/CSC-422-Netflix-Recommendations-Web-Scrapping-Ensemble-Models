Commendably the role of the 'Invisible Mother' was of a strong and independent woman struggling against the the adversity of being non visible.\n\nDespite her lack of effect on photonic radiation she presented a strong role model for any invisible girls thinking of bearing children.\n\nSadly, and much to my dismay, this could not stop the film stinking like a bucket of prawns in the sun."
