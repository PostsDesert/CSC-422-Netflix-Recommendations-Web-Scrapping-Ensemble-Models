The plot itself was refreshing, and performance by the actors were fairly decent, though it seems to have suffered because of the prolonged production time. The movie sort of fits little bit in the mid-90's feel (if it was made today, the title song would probably have been shot in Switzerland or some other scenic location rather than in some dry grassland in India - this was disappointing). The songs list could have been lot better as there is was a good selection on the CD but unfortunately some really bad numbers made it to the movie instead. Nevertheless, it's enjoyable if you don't set your expectations too high. Should provide for some interesting debates for newly weds!"
