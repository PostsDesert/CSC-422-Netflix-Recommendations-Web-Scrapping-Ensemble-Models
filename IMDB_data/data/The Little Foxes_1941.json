Regina (Bette) and her covetous brothers made the biblical passage \"the love of money is the root of all evil\" come to life.\n\nThe Little Foxes is an apt name. As animals Regina, Horace and Oscar not only would tear others to pieces to get what they want; they would eventually turn on each other to gain satisfaction.\n\nThe performance of Herbert Marshall made me immediately search for his other movies to view; I've not been disappointed. I am thankful his character was included to offset the viciousness of Regina and her brothers."
