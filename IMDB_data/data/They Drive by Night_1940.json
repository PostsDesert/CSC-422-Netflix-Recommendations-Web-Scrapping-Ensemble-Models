        "reviewBody": "Truck-driving brothers GEORGE RAFT and HUMPHREY BOGART not only have to put up with the hazards of wildcat driving but the manipulations of the scheming wife of boss ALAN HALE, played with intense conviction by IDA LUPINO.\n\nBut it's a plodding tale that takes awhile to work up any steam while director Raoul Walsh concentrates on the rough-housing camaraderie of the blue collar set before getting to the heart of the story involving two very different women--the good one, ANN SHERIDAN, and the femme fatale played with relish by IDA LUPINO. It is the romantic trio that ends in tragedy that gives the film its potent interest.\n\nLupino's mad scene on the stand is worth waiting for--although not entirely convincing. Nevertheless, she creates a vixen you won't soon forget.\n\nGeorge Raft ambles pleasantly through a rather dull role while Humphrey Bogart, as his brother, attracts more attention in a sideline role. Ann Sheridan is a sheer delight, adding her usual warmth and zest to a typical Sheridan role. The script crackles with tart remarks.\n\nNot exactly great filmmaking--and too long in getting started--but worth the wait for some good performances. Only drawback seemed to be ALAN HALE as an oafish boss who becomes even more obnoxious when he's drunk. Hale overplays the role to such a degree that, in a way, it comes as a relief to see Ida knock him off with those car doors. \"The doors made me do it!\" is her scream from the witness stand. \n\nSumming up: the kind of melodrama Warner was famous for in the '40s with the right cast doing it justice."
