And there might be expressed some technical properties of the structures and the laboratories of the station.\n\nAdditionally, the narrator is not expedient his voice was very monotonous. If they have been used a female voice for this documentary, it will cover the boring parts like unnecessary interview with the museum officer.\n\nYou may learn some interesting projects and statistics about the station but you must not expect more than that.",
