And after he does, he disappears into the night, never to be seen again---that is until a T.V. station offers 1 million dollars for the man to come forward and identify himself. Someone else takes the credit through a funny series of events that should remain unsaid.\n\nThis film is a true treasure. It not only examines fragile human issues like family responsibility, love, our stigmas that we set upon heroes and morality, but it is a damn entertaining movie. It is also a tearjerker. Not many people gave this film a chance but now that it is out on video, check this one out. You will be glad you did.",
