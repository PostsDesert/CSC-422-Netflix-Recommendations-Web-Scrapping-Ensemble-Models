        "reviewBody": "This movie is recommended for those who have insomnia's - otherwise don't waste your time. The plot outline on the cover is much better than the actual movie which is terrible. Listening to an oratory by a parakeet would be more exciting than this terrible movie!\n\nThe transfer quality of the DVD is also bad. There is a lot of distortion on the sound which makes it hard to understand what is being said. The color timing shifts with the advancing frames. Together with a poor plot, the acting is bad, which is surprising considering some of the actors used in the movie. Although it is sold as a \"budget movie,\" even the low price to pay is not worth buying this movie...if some of you insist on seeing \"A Fool and His Money,\" look for it in the television listings. And, have a \"pocket\" video game or something to help with the boredom!",
