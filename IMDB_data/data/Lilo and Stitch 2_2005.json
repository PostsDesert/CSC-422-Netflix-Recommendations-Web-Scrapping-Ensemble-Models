        "reviewBody": "Definitively better than 'Stitch! The Movie', though 'Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch' is still a pretty disappointing sequel.\n\nThe premise is uneven, everything involving Stitch and his glitch is actually quite good. However, they drag that out in order to add some stuff with Nani/David and Lilo herself, all of which isn't at all interesting; though there is, at least, a bit of heart in the way Lilo's storyline ends.\n\nSpeaking of Lilo, Dakota Fanning replaces Daveigh Chase in the role. Fanning is solid if a little more wooden, Chase's voice feels more natural. Chris Sanders gives an amusing performance as Stitch, while none of the others stand out all that much.\n\nStill way inferior to 2002's 'Lilo & Stitch', but thankfully it doesn't turn into pure toilet viewing like many other straight-to-video sequels from this studio.",
