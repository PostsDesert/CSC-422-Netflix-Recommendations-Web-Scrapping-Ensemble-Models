But somehow, director Catherine Hardwicke decided she was going to make the worst possible version imaginable.\n\nThis is, sadly, more like her \"Twilight\" film than anything else. A teenage girl (though Seyfried, like Kristen Stewart, is actually years old) who is attracted to a pale guy with terrible hair... and we throw a werewolf in there... and heck, why not add Billy Burke as the girl's father? Very disappointing. The color scheme, the thin plot, everything points to this being a pre-teen romance film and not horror, and that is just unforgivable.\n\nWhy Gary Oldman agreed to this film is beyond me. And how Hardwicke was able to take such talent and waste it is an even bigger mystery...",
