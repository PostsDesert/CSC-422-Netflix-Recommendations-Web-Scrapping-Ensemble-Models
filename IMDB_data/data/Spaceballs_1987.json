        "reviewBody": "\"Spaceballs\" is one of my favorite Mel Brooks comedies. Brooks has made some of the funniest movies of our time (\"The Producers\", \"Brazing Saddles\", \"High Anxiety\", etc.) and I think \"Spaceballs\" is up there in the same league. This film spoofs the \"Star Wars\" movies in general, but there's also references to \"Star Trek\", \"Alien\", and \"Planet of the Apes\" just to name a few. The actors are all very funny, with Brooks in two roles: President Skroob and Yogurt (his version of Yoda); the late John Candy as Barf the mawg (half man, half dog); Rick Moranis as the Darth Vader clone Dark Helmet; Bill Pullman as Lone Starr, the Luke Skywalker takeoff; Daphne Zuniga as Princess Vespa, similar to Princess Leia; and Dot Matrix, the robot with the voice of Joan Rivers who's obviously in the C-3P0 role. There's plenty of silly gags throughout \"Spaceballs\", and I laughed most of the time. Very funny, entertaining sci-fi comedy from one of the great comedic filmmakers of all time. \n\n***1/2 (out of four)",
