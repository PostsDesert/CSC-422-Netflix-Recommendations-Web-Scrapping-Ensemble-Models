        "reviewBody": "I'm not much of a Damon Wayans fan, but this is one of my favorite movies. The cover is misleading since Major Payne doesn't smile much in the movie. I also don't think it is for children due to the profanity and adult situations. Given the right target audience, though, this movie is hilarious. If you have ever been in the real military (sorry AF vets), you should see the humor in a battle-crazed but hardcore military officer using adult military training techniques on children in order to teach them discipline and teamwork. I don't think anyone could have played that role better than Damon Wayans. I believe this movie shows he has true acting talent which doesn't seem to show up much in his other movies.",
