        "reviewBody": "This French all-action comic-book-style adventure pits the lovely Mallory and her team of Anti-Paranormal Commandos against the forces of darkness led by Abaddon, as he seeks to bring an end to the human race's time on Earth.\n\nMallory is joined by Hot Transvestite Vena Cava, a blue-wigged be-platformed explosives expert in platform shoes (comics fans should think of Lord Fanny crossed with that one out of Codename: Knockout); Talking Tina (une petite fille extralucide) and Inspector Durand.\n\nIt's The Invisibles meets \"The Pope Must Die\".\n\nIt's 50% Buffy, 50% Xena and 50% totally over the top French superhero fun. Before the screening, director Julien Magnat told us that he was a big fan of superheroines \"Wonder Woman, Buffy and Xena - especially Xena\" and this could be a fine potential TV series in that vein. Larger than life and rather nicely satirical, there is, as you'd expect with a film about religious paranormal business, a fair bit of scathing commentary. Vena Cava, when rescuing the Pope, berates him about banning condoms.\n\nThis film has exploding heads, exploding nuns, a faceless succubus and a sexy vampire. It is not for the religiously devout or the humourless type who thinks Sam Raimi TV series are nothing more than rubbish. It's got human-demon romance. And it's got a pink hearse !",
