        "reviewBody": "It's unfortunate the choices Terrence Howard had to make while still a struggling actor in Black Hollywood. This is a movie that is well cast with very capable and talented actors--and puts them to shame.\n\nThe direction, camera-work and editing are terrible and are not helped by the full-screen DVD transfer, which kills the composition. Basically the plot is this--Howard, Robin Givens and Paula Jai Parker are radio hosts of a relationship call-in show. They get calls which become the basis of several vignettes a-la \"Love American Style.\" Every great actor has at least one of these on their resume. Tom Hanks has \"He Knows You're Alone.\" Tom Cruise has \"Losin' It.\" Michael Caine does one a year. With a budget and better writing, this might have been a decent time waster. Unfortunately, it's not, so don't waste your time.",
