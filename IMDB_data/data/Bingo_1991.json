He did have several mishaps along the way of finding Chuckie and his family. The saddest part of the movie is in the scene when Bingo has to jump through that ring of fire during the circus show and seeing the fire reminds him of when he was a puppy and the pet store he was born in caught on fire and his mother was lying halfway out of a cage dead. And the next scene in Bingo's recollection where he was sitting in front of his mother's memorial fountain that read: \"TAFFY- Beloved Mother\" made it even more sad.I almost cried.\n\nThe rest of the movie was very funny. I thought it was really cool during that hospital scene in the last 10 minutes of the film where every single person bingo met on his journey came together to visit him and wish him well. I'm 20 and I STILL love this movie"
