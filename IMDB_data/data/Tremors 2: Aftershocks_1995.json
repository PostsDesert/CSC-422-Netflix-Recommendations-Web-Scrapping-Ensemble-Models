Having Fred Ward and Michael Gross back helped this movie a lot. I was disappointed to find out this was released direct to video. It has the potential to be a big screen release and could have made more. Overall, Tremors 2: Aftershocks is a okay movie. If you've seen the first movie, you might as well see this one."
