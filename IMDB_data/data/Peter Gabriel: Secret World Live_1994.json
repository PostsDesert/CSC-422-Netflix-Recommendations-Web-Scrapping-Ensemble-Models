        "reviewBody": "I saw this live and the DVD really captures the essence of the show. The use of two stages (the male and female representation) choice of songs and of course, Peter's on testosterone really fuels the performance. His show included the perfect supporting musicians including Paula Cole's amazing vocals (if you don't get chills when she duets \"Don't Give Up\" then you are truly dead). There is no prerecorded vocals or instruments here, he is for sure one of the best live performers as he always has been. I'd give it a 10, but only if he re-releases it on Blu-Ray...I can only hope. Secret World live is required for any music lover's DVD collection.",
