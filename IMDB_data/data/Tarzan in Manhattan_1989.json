        "reviewBody": "This is basically light hearted action/adv. Movie with comedy elements. Strange that comedy is out of genre description here. And there was lot of it - for instance in early part, where New Yorkers were described as worse than worst beasts in jungle. And of course, did not miss to call that city as different kind of jungle.\n\nPart where they said that monkey may speak Hungarian, then started to drive a car was hilarious.\n\nScreen writer's name Anna Sandor indicates Hungarian origin. And same for Archimedes :-)\n\nJoe Lara does not look as typical tough action movie star. Sensitive part was important, and I think that it was good, and probably the reason for lower ratings by many.\n\nI liked Kim Crosby as Jane, she was exactly what Tarzan needed in for him unknown and hostile environment.\n\nAnd good side is that movie did not take self too seriously. Actually, this is very good for TV movie.",
