        "reviewBody": "No American movie so ambivalent as Gloria. Is it a good movie or a bad? Frankly, I just don't know. I saw this film as part of a series of classic movies in a Dutch cinema. New copy! the ad said and I never saw the movie from beginning to end. Reason enough to go. Speaking about the end... It did disappoint me a lot. After watching Gena walking on high heals through New York for two hours, Cassavetes surprises me with this terrible Hollywood ending! But after reading some of the comments on IMDb I rather give it a second thought. So Cassavetes shot the end of Gloria in black and white? I didn't know that. It makes a difference. Why the hell would Gloria come to the cemetery in a mob car in stead of just a regular cab? And why dressed up as the boy's grandmother? It must be the imagination of the boy. That's why the boy runs in slow motion (and in black and white) to Gloria. Running towards a certain death that is! Cassavetes said in a interview that he didn't want the boy shot in pieces at the end of the movie, but that doesn't mean the boy will survive! So, maybe Cassavetes didn't make a Hollywood ending after all. Let's give Gloria the benefit of the doubt. It's a good movie, worth remembering.",
