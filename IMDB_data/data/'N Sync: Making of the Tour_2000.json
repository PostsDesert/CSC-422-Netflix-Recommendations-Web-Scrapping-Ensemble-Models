        "reviewBody": "this is a must for a nsync fan or for anyone to really appreciate artists who goes on tours. It shows that it's not just go up on stage stand there and look pretty and thats about it. It's not just everyone else working hard and the artist gets to sit there on their butts. The artist has to put in a great amount of work and that's what this video makes you realize if you didn't already know it. It made me have more respect for NSYNC seeing how hard they really work. There is also many amusing moments of NSYNC fooling around and great footage of them practicing dances to their sophomore album 'No Strings Attached'. It includes concert footage at the end of the video. All that said, it's also great to watch just so you could feast your eyes on the guys (i'm very partial to lance myself) it's definitely worth buying it was a great idea to make a video of what it's like preparing a tour."
