        "reviewBody": "When \"I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry\" came out in the summer of 2007, it jogged my memory about a movie called \"The Gay Deceivers\" that was out when I was in junior high and which I was too young to see. Netflix didn't own a copy, but evidently they keep track of who inquires on movies they don't have and send it out when they get it. So boom, \"The Gay Deceivers\" arrives by surprise in my mailbox six months later. Regarding the review headlined, \"Offensive and Unfunny\", I'm going to say just one thing, in my campiest voice, \"Oh Mary, lighten up\". (How dare they make a movie in 1969 that offends my 21st century sensitivities!) Yes, some of it is hard to watch, maybe for me especially. It was made about the time of my sexual awakening, and some of the stereotypes depicted underscored for me why I had grown up with so much internalized homophobia. But they were making a farce and all they had to work with was how gays were perceived at the time. It's a little too much to expect them to have transcended the thinking of the time in which it was filmed. But on the other hand, some of it is still laugh out loud funny. Especially the scene where Michael Greer makes breakfast. I laughed, then I turned to my partner of fifteen years and said, \"I suppose as a gay man I ought to be offended, but it's just so silly!\"",
