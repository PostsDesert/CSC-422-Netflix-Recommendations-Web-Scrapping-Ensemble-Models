        "reviewBody": "TiVo recorded this as a \"suggestion\" recently, and I realized that I\n\nhad never seen the film before. MAROONED was released in the\n\nscience fiction film dark age that stretched between 2001 and\n\nSTAR WARS, so I wasn't expecting much. In fact, MAROONED is a\n\ngripping film from the beginning. The cast, headed by Gregory\n\nPeck (geez, do we miss positive male authority figures like him!) is\n\nuniformly outstanding. We get to see a young Gene Hackman,\n\nyears before his breakout in THE FRENCH CONNECTION, and\n\ncareer-best performances from David Jansen, Mariette Hartley,\n\nRichard Crenna, and James Franciscus.\n\nThe production values are first-rate, and the scenes set in NASA\n\nfacilities on the ground are the most realistic ever filmed, better\n\neven than APOLLO 13. NASA apparatchiks sling around enough\n\nacronyms to fill a family-sized box of Alpha Bits, and die-hard fans\n\nof space travel won't be disappointed in the technical detail.\n\n The pan & scan print I saw on Cinemax was superb; it looked\n\nbrand new. The sound was pretty much what one would expect in\n\nan average flick from the late 1960s. \n\nI have rated this film as an '8', a grade I rarely give. I would have\n\nranked it higher but for a draggy ending with cheesy EVA effects. I\n\nstill recommend this film highly, even for those with no particular\n\ninterest in space travel or science fiction. The dramatic core is\n\nwhat drives this film, and there is no disappointment there.",
