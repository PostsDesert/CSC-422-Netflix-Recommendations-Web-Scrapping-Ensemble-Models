If they called this entertainment, then the Battlefield Earth was defintely the best movie ever made. I made a better movie when I was in junior high school. I agree about the plot (uhh, what was the plot). Acting was poor at best, Rhys-Davies is an excellent actor and even he couldn't pull this one out. The Action was horrifying. Stunts were terrible and the only other good thing in the movie (besides Rhys-Davies)was the CGI dragons. Decent dragons, liked the crunching. They should take this movie back and start over again and this time use money to pay people to actually make a movie."
