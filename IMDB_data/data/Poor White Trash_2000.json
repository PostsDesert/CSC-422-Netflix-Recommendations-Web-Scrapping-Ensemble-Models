        "reviewBody": "As a Southern Illinois native myself, I can say without a doubt this movie only scratches the surface of Southern Illinois people. So.Il. does have it's share of \"rednecks\" but that is not the majority. It's interesting to read the claims of accurate representation of former SIU students from the north. Much of SIU's enrollment come from northern Illinois residents who flock to the college for it's money saving advantages. So really most social interactions are northerner to northerner. To be labeled something by people because of geographical location is a bit narrow minded and absurd. That being said I enjoyed the movie and thought it was rather entertaining. It was funny and the cast was an interesting mix but they all worked really well together. My favorite part was the beer can lawn art!",
