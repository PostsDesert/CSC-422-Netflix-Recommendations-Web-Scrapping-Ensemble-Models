Super supportive dad. Those huge slabs of rock already contained the figures and he was only revealing them! \"It emerges evenly, like an object rising to the surface of the water... A sculptor can achieve nothing that the marble itself does not contain.\" WOW I had to keep rewinding to capture these absolute gems, spoken at this pace:\n\nI'm carving another Piet√°. God grant I may finish it.\n\nSo different from my first in Saint Peter's when I was twenty.\n\nBeauty was my idol then; now faith alone guides,\n\nleads me by the hand to my day of judgement.\n\nOn the martyred skin of Saint Bartholomew,\n\nI painted my own face.",
