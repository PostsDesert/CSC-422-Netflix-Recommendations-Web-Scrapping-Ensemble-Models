        "reviewBody": "I can't believe that some people thought any part of this film was boring! It isn't an action movie. It's about the developing relationship between two mature people and it is, indeed, a comedy. There are some great lines from Ingrid, who holds one spellbound throughout - with her acting, with her beauty and with those elegant gowns. Sorry, don't even mention those other actresses in the same breath as Bergman! She is in a class of her own - and shows it in this film. She was 42 when she filmed it - and it really doesn't make any difference. She's not pretending to be a young girl with her first lover. As for any comparison with \"Notorious\" - no! You can't compare these two films. Both are great, both star Bergman and Grant - similarity ends there! I would like to add that the supporting roles are admirably played by all - especially the brilliant Cecil Parker [Alfred Munson], who had me in stitches.
