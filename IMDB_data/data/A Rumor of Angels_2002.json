She is a magnificent presence on screen, and it was great watching her with Trevor, who must have had to really stretch to match her formidable skills. He does a great job, and I had no difficulty accepting his character on the same level as hers.\n\nYes, it is a \"heart-warming\" story, but it addresses death with honesty and some real-world strategies for getting past the grief of losing a loved one. It also has some fantasy strategies, but those don't get in the way of the real ones.\n\nI loved the use of Mozart's music, particularly the \"Ave Verum Corpus\" choral piece.",
