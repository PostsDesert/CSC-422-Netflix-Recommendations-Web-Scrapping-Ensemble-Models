        "reviewBody": "After watching the release trailer of \"In Harm's Way\" I was expecting already an excellent episode considering the way the previous one ended and, damn it, I was completely blown away! Congratulations to Telltale for creating a great and credible antagonist. I was so angry and so frustrated with Carver that all I wanted to do was to make him suffer.\n\nI always believed Clementine had always a small dark side inside her and this episode confirms my suspicious. The Walking Dead Season 2: Episode 3 - \"In Harm's Way\" can show you a darker and vengeful Clementine where we can witness it during her talk with Carver and the last scene with Kenny in the end of the episode.\n\nOverall, don't lose this episode because this is Telltale at their best and the ending is so bad-ass that that it will make you want to play the 4th episode right away! It's a pity that we have to wait 1/2 month(s)",
