        "reviewBody": "I don't know why this movie is so underrated. I never hear anything about it, as if it's a bad secret that no one wants to get out. I don't see why. This movie was fun to watch. I know, its kind of simple and not very \"edgy\" or anything like that, but who cares really. It's still good. Charlie Sheen gave a great performance as Jackson Hammond, an escaped convict who is the cause of the chase. Kirsty Swanson was also very well cast as the spoiled, kidnapped, rich daughter; Natalie Voss. Henry Rollins was also very well cast as the cocky Officer Dobbs, and Josh Mostel was good as Dobbs' partner, Officer Figus. Marshall Bell was actually not the type of person to play Ari Josephson, Hammond's lawyer. But he managed to pull it off well I see. Everyone else was well cast for the most part, no flawed performances to speak of. The story was kind of shallow but still enjoyable. There were twists and turns here and there but it all worked out. The soundtrack was GREAT. The Offspring, NOFX, Rancid, and Bad Religion are some of my favorite bands and I was surprised that their songs were played in this movie. I rate this an 8/10, see this movie, it is somehow very good.",
