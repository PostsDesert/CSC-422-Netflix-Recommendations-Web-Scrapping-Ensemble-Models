        "reviewBody": "Lords of the freaks they are. Their music is superb, and the twisted humor they manage is not far behind, which also is shown in here. 2vsN is one of the finest music document this pair could've release. It's Steely Dan magnificent sound plus vision; what else can anyone ask for? They rule.\n\nThere's no doubt about it; if you're reading this, that can only means that you're as a die-hard fan of their music as anybody whom has listened to them 'cause it's all so natural. They have one of the most loyal group of people supporting an art made under the moniker of Steely Dan (beside the Deadheads, of course). Once you've heard'em, you can't fight the spell they put on you through music. A must for any fan. This DVD includes songs like Kid Charlemagne, FM, Jack of speed, Peg, Gaslighting Abbie, Green earrings, Bad sneakers, Janie runaway and so on. This edition has no special features but, who cares? It's all about music, and this couple sure knows how to create it in order to reach the sky; and take us with them up with every chord, with every line Fagen sings and every string Becker hits.\n\nA laboratory band with two mad rock scientists in front and a jazzy background. Fagen and Becker are masters of art. They seduce your ears like anyone else can or ever could, and now they do the same with your sight. Go buy it!",
