These are comedy horrors and harmless ones at that.\n\nLeprechaun 3 is noted as being Warwick Davis favourite and I can see why, it blows the others I've seen out of the water with it's fantastic humour and performances by the cast.\n\nOur leading lady however retired straight after production, perhaps this isn't what she had in mind when she went into acting.\n\nThis third part see's our titular character venture to Las Vegas where one of his golden shillings is stolen. Cue the bloodshed & brilliant comedic quips.\n\nWatching this almost helped me forget about the embarrassment that was the WWE's reboot of the franchise back in 2014 with Origins.\n\nHarmless fun and the best one of the franchise that I've seen up until now.\n\nThe Good: \n\nHumour is on point \n\nCast is great especially Davis \n\nLooks solid \n\nThe Bad:\n\nA bit silly in places \n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nLeprechauns need health insurance to\n\nI really want to see a Leprechaun vs Chucky crossover now",
