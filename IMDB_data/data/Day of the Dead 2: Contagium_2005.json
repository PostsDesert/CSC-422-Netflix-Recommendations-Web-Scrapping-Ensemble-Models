I have a feeling this thing was made with some other title in mind like, for instance, plain old \"Contagium\", but the filmmakers were saddled with the tag-on \"Day of the Dead 2\" by crass marketing hacks. I'll give the makers of this drek the benefit of the doubt. But there is no doubt that they should never, ever make a movie again. As noted by other posters, \"DOTD2:C\" cherry-picks bits and bobs from other genre offerings and turns them into an emetic pile of poo. The acting ranges from awful to competent, but the writing and direction are heinous. That it was a labor that took years to realize boggles the mind. Talk about \"why bother?\" A must avoid on every level.\n\nOn a personal note: I made the double mistake of watching it right after George A. Romero's \"Land of the Dead\", which no doubt made \"Contagium\" even more toxic a shock to my system. It was like following a beautifully cooked piece of filet mignon with a dessert of dog vomit.",
