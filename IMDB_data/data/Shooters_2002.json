I wanted to wait it out until the end to see how these characters prevailed or failed. Good action sequences....as action goes. As an American I am always looking for life in the UK. But I can't really compare gang war from one country to the other.Thankfully I am not fluent in either. I have to say that I have been watching Ioan Gruffudd for some time now and that was my motivation for seeing this film, along with his flatmate Mathew Ryhs. Quite nice to look at even for brief moments. Why do I have to submit 10 lines? I am not a literary agent.... ohcheap1",
