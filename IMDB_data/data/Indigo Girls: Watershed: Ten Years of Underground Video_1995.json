It coincides with the release of their 2-CD live compilation of their 10-year career (to that point) of their first 1200 concerts, hence the title 1200 Curfews. Watershed also contains clips from backstage and behind the scenes footage of their earlier career. This movie would be a cherished possession of any Indigo Girls fan.",
