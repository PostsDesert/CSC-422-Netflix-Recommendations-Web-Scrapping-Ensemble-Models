Sad thing is, it's a fair story, with some solidly laudable acting (and some solidly BAD, too).\n\nMemento worked because it followed a linear pattern, even if that pattern was reversed. \"Tesseract\" leaps all over the place, leaving folks with that head scratching, pause-button-hitting sense of \"huh?\" Sure, you can figure it out, but do you really want to spend the whole movie figuring out time line instead of enjoying the film?\n\nUnless that's your sort of gig . . .\n\nIn all? Ton of potential here, not much of it realized.",
