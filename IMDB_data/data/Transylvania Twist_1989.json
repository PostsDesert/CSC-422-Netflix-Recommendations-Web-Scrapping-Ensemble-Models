        "reviewBody": "I love this movie. I think it belongs up there with other horror parodies like \"Repossessed,\" \"Silence of the Hams\" and \"Dracula-Dead and Loving It.\" Teri Copley was a funny, beautiful and talented actress; much more than just a pretty face. It's probably the only horror parody which makes the most horror references that I've seen even if it did leave out the Wolfman, Frankenstein's monster and the Mummy. It's also filled with cameos galore such as horror mogul Forrest J. Ackerman, scream queen Brinke Stevens as a sexy vampire, Deanna Lund from \"Land of the Giants\" as a teacher, Jay Robinson most recently of \"Sleepy Hollow\" and Angus Scrimm of \"Phantasm.\" Video babe Becky LeBeau sings the songs which Teri lip-syncs to also has a bit part. Howard Morris from the \"Andy Griffith Show\" is a tamed down Ernest T. Bass as he plays the father of Teri's character. Ace Mask steals most of the laughs in this but Steve Altman is more than irritating as he tries to be funny; everytime I watch this, I do his lines so that I feel I've got the role. Robert Vaughn is also woefully miscast as he tries his hand at comedy. Steve Franken is also on hand as an inept constable who wouldn't know a vampire if it was already on his neck. Otherwise, the movie is one long enjoyable laughfest. It's a shame you can't find this on video anymore.",
