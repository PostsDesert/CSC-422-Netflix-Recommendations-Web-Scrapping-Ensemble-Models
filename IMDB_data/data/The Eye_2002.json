Overall I kinda liked the general look of the film. It didn't really have that creepy, \"somethings going to jump out at you any second during the entire film\" vibe that The Ring, Ringu and The Grudge had, which was actually a nice change because when those \"fright\" scenes happened the creepiness was actually increased quite a bit. I love the actors chosen too, especially the lead. She did a terrific job and didn't annoy me at all in the film. I have to admit to a few \"cheesy\" spots throughout it, but for what was lacking in the script was made up for in the direction. 7/10",
