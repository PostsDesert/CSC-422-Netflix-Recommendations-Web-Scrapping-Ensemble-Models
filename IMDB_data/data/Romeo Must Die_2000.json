        "reviewBody": "\"Romeo Must Die\" is definetely the most violent \"interpretation\" of Shakespeare I`ve ever seen. Okay, interpretation is not the right word to use, but that is nevertheless what this movie at some point wants to be. I really liked Jet Li in this movie, and I`ve liked him since I first saw him in \"Lethal Weapon 4\" a couple of years ago. Fighting and betrayal is what \"Romeo Must Die\" is all about, and the fighting is very entertaining, although sometimes a bit cheesy, because some of the \"Matrix-scenes\", which is out of place outside the world of science-fiction. Still, \"Romeo Must Die\" is an actionflick you wouldn`t want to miss. It manages to be interesting enough, but the fighting is what makes it really good. 8/10"
