But I felt lost when it came time to understand the underlying conflict which brought the two lost friends together. I am sure many viewers will not be fluent in Indian history, and the opening text sequences does not go far enough in setting the stage. I found myself trying to balance the beautifully shot footage with constantly trying to understand more about what was at stake."
