        "reviewBody": "Someone one here labeled this film \"hillybilly film noir.\" I think that's a great description of this movie. This is about the good 'ole boys racing their souped- up '50s Fords around country roads, running moonshine and trying to evade both cops and gangsters. In fact, I wish they had more of those chase scenes because, even with primitive special-effects, they were fun to watch. The ending chase would have been longer, if I had my way.\n\nMitchum is fun to watch in here, too. He just looked like a rugged guy, a \"man's man,\" as they say. His kid brother Jim made his film debut in here and wasn't bad for a beginner. He and another beginner, singer Keely Smith, are a bit wooden but passable as actors. Keely also had an interesting face.\n\nI think this is one of those films that gets better with each viewing. Highly recommended.",
