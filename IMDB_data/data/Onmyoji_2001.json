I thought the story was interesting, but I really fell in love with the character of Seimei. The characters are what make this worth watching. I saw this one before the original Onmyoji and enjoyed it so much, rented the original thereafter. I do have to say that I enjoyed the original a bit more, but this one was also really good.\n\nThe Pros:\n\nAbe No Seimei! The supernatural elements are pretty cool. The historical feel to the movie.\n\nThe Cons:\n\nI didn't really care for the characterization of Susa. His acting was OK, but I didn't connect as much with him. The ending special effects were OK, but not as good as the first movie's. The story moved along until towards the end, then kind of slowed down.",
