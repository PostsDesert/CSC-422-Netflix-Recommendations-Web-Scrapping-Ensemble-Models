But this means I did see it through, as opposed to just losing it after an episode or less. So let's look at the good things first, eh? The art is superb. All the characters are gorgeous: heroes, support team, villains, victims, everybody. Real eye candy. The protagonists are engaging and loveable, and the premise is interesting. Then there's the plot. I bow to thee and beseech thee, the twelve gods that protect me, what is this horror of a plot? It's got more holes than a swiss cheese. It has more guns that don't end up shooting than a Texas weapon fair. It's full of people being so friggin' stupid it's physically painful. Nothing makes any kind of sense. The choices, the relationships, the outcomes, everything is forced and pretty much random. To be fair, if you watch to the end, the antagonist does have a reason for the way he acts. It's not reasonable, it lacks internal logic, but his actions are not as completely random as it seems for most of the series. Honestly, I would not pay for this series, and I'm debating asking for my time back.",
