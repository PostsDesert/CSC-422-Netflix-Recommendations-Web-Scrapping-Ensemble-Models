        "reviewBody": "\"Stargate\"'s an exciting, high concept science fiction film from Roland (\"Independence Day\") Emmerich. With a capable cast, solid script and excellent set design, this is a big-budget adventure for viewers looking for pure escapist fun.\n\nThe ever reliable Kurt Russell plays the square-jawed, world weary Jack O'Neil, who is responsible for leading the military mission to another world. James Spader plays the brilliant archaeologist, Dr. Daniel Jackson. At the time, this was a different type of role for Spader and he handles the humorous content of his scenes with great success.\n\nThere's also an appearance by \"The Crying Game\"'s Jaye Davidson as the evil baddie, Ra. Although Davidson's role is quite small, he brings an other-worldly presence to his part.\n\nThe score by David Arnold is excellent.\n\nA great idea for a movie, I can't help but think the concept would have made a successful television series..."
