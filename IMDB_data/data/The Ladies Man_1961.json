        "reviewBody": "Herbert H. Heebert (Jerry Lewis) is broken hearted when he finds his childhood sweetheart with another man. Swearing off women for good he accepts a job at a boarding house run by Helen Wellenmellen (Helen Traubel), unaware that it's a women only house-and it's full of them! Could it be that they can be good for Herbert and he be good for them?\n\nJerry Lewis stars, co-writes and directs a virtually plot less film that's almost entirely set in one magnificent mansion set. As was the case with many of Lewis' film's, it relies on his character creation to bring in the laughs. Which is the case here, the problem being that his surrounding cast are not of the required standard to fully form the comedy. With the exception of the dependable Kathleen Freeman, nobody else comes forward to raise some laughs or enhance on Jerry's goofing. Thus Lewis has to once again carry the can, which works to a degree, but entering the last third the joke that is Herbert Heebert starts to wear thin and only his hardiest fans will be able to stay with him. There's many musings on the film across various internet sources that delve deep into the piece as some sort of masterpiece of sexual identity, machismo empowerment and etc. I don't see it myself, but maybe that's just because I want a Jerry Lewis movie to make me howl with laughter above all else! And for sure The Ladies Man does do that on occasions; because it ultimately is a comic vehicle for Lewis, as a soloist, that works splendidly. His direction is excellent with the camera work around the house fluid and very involving, while the Technicolor production really sparkles and enhances the rich visuals available around the star of the show--the set! A good but not great film, but Lewis as ever, to us his fans, entertains royally. 6/10",
