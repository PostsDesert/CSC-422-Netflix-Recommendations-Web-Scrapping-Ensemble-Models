        "reviewBody": "Everyone is trying to say this is suppose to be a comedy. I have a collection of around 300 movies and alot of them are funny as hell but not classified as comedy. Lethal Weapon 4 for example had more humor in it than Death Machine. This is a great movie with a strong resemblance to Aliens, not Alien despite public opinion. The costume design on the Hardman suit was very good for a low budget film. The camera work was really good especially in certain scenes where several emotions are caught in them. The movie features a good plot and believable tech for the year it takes place in. It does feature some cheesy lines in a couple of parts but other than that its dialogue is strong. Our tree hugging heros are very likable too. In my own humble opinion which of course is the only one that matters, if this were re-released as a theatrical motion picture, it'd be the action flick of the summer next year! This one gets a 9!"
