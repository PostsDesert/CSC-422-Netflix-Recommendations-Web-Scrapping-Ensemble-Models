        "reviewBody": "Strong performances and great restraint make Heavy a deftly handled, beautiful and subtly moving piece. Despite the apparent futility of Victor's interest in Callie, they're both changed in ways which are worth seeing. Aside from Evan Dando's slight awkwardness, the acting in this film is understated and very believable - Shelley Winters is warm and careworn, even Debbie Harry manages to blend in to the low-key scenery. Beautifully shot and directed, with a superb score from Thurston Moore, \"Heavy\" is a piece of cinema rather than a story shoe-horned into a screenplay. This won't satisfy anyone looking for simple plot and resolution, but for the rest of us there's a lot to admire.",
