        "reviewBody": "Well, it's absolutely no surprise that ALANiS has managed to surpass everyone once again. Is there anything she can't do?! Honestly. Multi-talented ALANiS gives the viewer a glimpse at life on the road of touring. Very entertaining video - well worth the watch...well of course it is, it stars ALANiS(who else?). Ever since 1987 ALANiS has been blessing Canada with her superb lyrics and absolutely amazing vocals. There are very few words out there that are \"ALANiS Worthy\" to describe just how amazing her talents are. Absolutely terrific rockumentary directed, filmed and edited by ALANiS Morissette herself(naturally the reason why it's so damn good). If anyone out there wants to see a film that's well worth the watch...it's \"Alanis Morissette: Jagged Little Pill Live\". A must have for fans and for someone who is just longing for some damn good entertainment. This is rated 10 000/10 in my books. (\"It came in her dream, a light so extreme yeah, a voice in her head and it said: Step Inside The REAL WORLD ALANiS\") 1992~ Rock On ALANiS!!!",
