        "reviewBody": "Normally, Dragonball Z movies have weak plots, horrible dubbing, censorship up the wazoo, and pretty useless fighting. However, this one is an excellent example of what the movies SHOULD have been like.\n\nBardock is a saiyan who, like everyone else on his home planet Vegeta, works for Freeza. One day, his team of low-level soldiers take out a planet that was giving even Freeza's highest elite teams a run for their money. However, the last survivor curses Bardock by giving him the power to see the future.\n\nBardock begins to dream about Goku's future back on Vegeta, while the rest of his team is sent to another planet on Freeza's orders. Bardock dreams that Goku will become a great warrior, but thinks nothing of it. However, as the plot unfolds, and he learns what Freeza is planning, he realizes that Goku will be the only hope for the universe someday.\n\nThe stuff I can't give away is what really makes the plot so wonderful. There are only a few fights, but that's to be expected; the plot is the main focus here. However, two fights do stand out: a little Vegeta destroys a bunch of Saibamen, and Bardock's final confrontation with Freeza. Overall, I recommend that any moderate to hardcore DBZ fan get this movie sometime. Trust me, you won't regret it."
