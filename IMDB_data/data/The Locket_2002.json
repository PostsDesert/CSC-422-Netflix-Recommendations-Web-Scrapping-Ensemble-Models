With a thickening plot and emotional turmoil building, a young man named Michael (played well by Chad Willet) cares for an elderly woman named Esther (played very well by Vanessa Redgrave). Or is it that Esther cares for Michael? One part I didn't like much was in a dance setting (kissing), but overall it was a very decent film with no swearing. With great acting a touching story, this is another winner from Hallmark Hall of Fame.",
