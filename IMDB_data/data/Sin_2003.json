        "reviewBody": "\"Sin\" is a uneven but entertaining revenge film. The plot: Ex-Cop Eddie Burns (Rhames) wants revenge for the rape of his sister. He encounters all sorts of seedy types when he realizes his old nemesis Charlie Strom (Oldman) was in on it. A cat and mouse game begins, and secrets are revealed, who will escape? \n\nThere is one great scene with Gary Oldman and Ving Rhames where they talk about the nature of life and conscience. That scene is almost worth the price of the rental. Besides that scene, the whole movie is piled with clich√©s and underwritten characters. The movie wastes Gregg Henry and Brian Cox. The chase scene near the end looks like a car commercial. I give a a ** star rating\n\nFor more insanity, please visit: comeuppancereviews.com",
