It ended with a few un-answered questions though so i was keen to see the movie in the hope that it would explain some of these.\n\nIt answers some...\n\n.....badly \n\nThen it asks lots more...\n\n....and explains none of them.\n\nThe characters are butchered (some relegated to one line, while newer characters we care nothing for dominate the screen time). The film is devoid of humour and missing most of the TV series themes.\n\nThe one great thing about Nadesico was that it was fun, this is just a depressing piece of s**t. Its like the makers got confused and thought they were making an Evangelion movie not a Nadesico one (for the record I love Evangelion, but I liked Nadesico for not being the same).\n\nIn short if you love the series AVOID. Its like Highlander II and Star Wars the Phantom Menace, it actually takes away some of your enjoyment of the originals, particularly when you find out some of the horrible things they have done to the charters.\n\nI think this is actually the movie I hate most in the world. There are some crap films that I just think are crap. This actually offended me.\n\nRight, I'm off to take a shower, since this film made me feel unclean.",
