Some films can be viewed once and that's enough, but not this one.\n\nAll the cast members are remarkable in projecting the ordinary bleakness of the story's circumstances -- the people, time and place, their foibles, tragedies, and often futile efforts as they struggle with events. Believe it or not, I even got to like Olivier's singing of \"Why Should I Care\"!\n\nA memorable, thoughtful film well worth experiencing.",
