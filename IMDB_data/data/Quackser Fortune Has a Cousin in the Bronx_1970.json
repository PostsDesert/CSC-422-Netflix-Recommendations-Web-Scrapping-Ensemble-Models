This little movie shows his talent, and his genius. It is not much, movie-wise, but I enjoyed every second of watching Gene Wilder do his thing and create a character with depth and detail. Comedy is hard, and a performance like this shows you how a 'serious' actor can turn his craft into comedy gold.",
