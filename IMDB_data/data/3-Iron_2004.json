Not that there is no talking at all here, but there's not really much talking either. And there is no need for it anyways.\n\nThis drama that unfolds right before your eyes is so gripping and strong, that it's painful. But that is the intention of director Kim Ki Duk. His movies are never easy ... and this is no exception. So if you like a movie with a story, but with a moving pace that could even tire a snail, than watch this. Everyone else beware! The camera work and the acting is superb, but wouldn't help if you can't cope with the slow rhythm of the movie! :o)",
