        "reviewBody": "I feel like \"Wild at Heart\" is one of Lynch's forgotten films, and I can sort of see why. Though I enjoyed my time with Sailor (Nicolas Cage, \"Leaving Las Vegas\"), Lula (Laura Dern, \"Marriage Story\"), and all the other various other bizarre characters that populate this weird romantic tale, I can honestly say that this is one of my least favorite Lynch movies. It's not bad, it just doesn't do a whole lot for me, especially when compared to Lynch's masterpieces (Twin Peaks TV show, \"Eraserhead\", \"Mulholland Drive\", \"Inland Empire\"). When Lynch is at the peak of his directing powers, his films can prompt me to question and meditate upon the very nature of our reality; \"Wild at Heart\" is just a decent road trip movie with a few really quirky moments and a whole lot of wackos.\n\nAs a side note: it blows my mind that this won the Palme d'Or in 1990. According to IMDb's trivia section on this film, Roger Ebert, who seemed to have a distaste for Lynch (check out his \"Blue Velvet\" review), booed so loudly that it almost drowned out the cheers when the award was announced. Though I honestly don't think this film deserves to stand beside the likes of other winners like \"Parasite\", \"Shoplifters\", \"Blue is the Warmest Color\", or \"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\", I also can't ever imagine being so upset over a film award that I'd boo the recipient... but hey, that's just me.",
