        "reviewBody": "This is one of those films that come along in a great while that both enthralls and disturbs you. Mimi Rodgers plays a woman caught up in depressing job as a directory assistance operator with her only escape, the sexual games and encounters she has with her lover. Driven to seek a better life, she is drawn into a religious cult that has her believing the Apocalypse is near. She is chosen by the group to go out to the rugged landscape and wait for a sign from God. What happens there is the remarkable and torturous journey of a woman brought to madness and questioning all that she believes in. This film haunts you long afterwards like witnessing a roadside accident. You are mesmerized by the horror of it while at the same time wanting to turn away. This film is powerful, provocative and deeply moving. A must see for serious film lovers."
