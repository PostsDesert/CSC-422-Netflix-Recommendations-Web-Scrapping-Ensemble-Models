After winning big at the casino, everything seems great, until a gang of criminals moves in to poop on the party! Now, Ray must rise to the occasion.\n\nSound familiar? Well, that's no surprise, since this movie follows the same formula as every other post-DIE HARD, action movie of the 1980's-90's! Be it located in a high-rise, a train, a ship at sea, or a casino, it's always about the same. Endless gunfire, explosions, and impossible, unbelievable action sequences all go off like so many firecrackers.\n\nThe hero must overcome unfathomable odds to take on the bad guys, a group that is always outfitted like a small army, and usually led by an odious thug.\n\nUnfortunately, such a film requires a Bruce Willis, a Stallone, or, of course, an Arnold to pull it off! In a pinch, perhaps Chuck Norris or Steven Segal. Weller just doesn't have the moxie! Make no mistake, he was fantastic in ROBOCOP! This just isn't his forte.\n\nWithout that uber-charismatic, or ultra-manly hero, it all crumbles into blandness, no matter how many lives are lost..."
