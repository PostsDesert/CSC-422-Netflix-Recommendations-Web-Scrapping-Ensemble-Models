        "reviewBody": "I really enjoyed this concert DVD of Jeff Lynne's Zoom Tour which was made over a decade ago. The quality of the camera-work is great--very professional and very well done. Additionally, the music quality is also very nice. \n\nSince I have been a Lynne/ELO fan for decades, it's not at all surprising that I'd like this DVD--and it would have been weird if I hadn't! However, I must honestly also acknowledge that Lynne's USA tour was canceled soon after it began because ticket sails were so poor! So, because of this, folks on the East Coast like me didn't have a chance to attend the concert! And, you can rightly assume his music isn't exactly popular today! So, while I would score the DVD very high, I doubt if most non-fans would. \n\nMy only negative about this is the DVD menu--which looks pretty cheap and pretty stupid. It's a HUGE contrast to the rest of the DVD.",
