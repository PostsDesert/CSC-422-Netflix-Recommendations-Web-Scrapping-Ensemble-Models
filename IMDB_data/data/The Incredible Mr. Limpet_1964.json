        "reviewBody": "This little oddball film from the mid 60's is hard to characterize. In the days just before the attack on Pearl Harbor, a nerdy, winsome misfit who is yet very amiable and loved by others, feels something just isn't right about his life. He interacts far more effectively with the little marine creatures inhabiting the aquarium in his house, than he does with his wife, friends, and co-workers.\n\nNobody but Don Knotts (doesn't that slightly knotted-up Knotts face slightly resemble a fishy to begin with? lol), could have pulled off a way-out live action/animation fantasy comedy like this. That high-pitched, nasally voice talent of his fits this role to a tee. Limpet sees (what he perceives to be) the carefree life of a fish, and wishes with all his might to be one of them. Presto, change-o, morpho! Welcome to the Atlantic a new bespectacled fish that has a unique ability that comes in handy for survival and in other ways you simply won't expect.\n\nOdder still than all of that is the way the plucky little fish finds himself enmeshed in the naval battles of World War II. Although WW2 would seem like a stark place to set a fantasy comedy, this wacky little film manages to take all these elements and run with them for playful laughs. I'm not sure how I (or anybody else) would handle seeing a friend talking from the water as a fish, and the supporting cast are all perfect in the humorous \"playing down\" reactions they have to this bizarre situation.\n\nFun stuff.",

His friend George Stickle is in the Navy and lays it on pretty thick. If Henry could have one thing it would be to become a fish. While on a visit to Coney Island, Henry falls into the water and miraculously gets his wish. Now a fish, he makes friends, Ladyfish and Crusty the hermit crab and loves his new life. He also uses his abilities to help the US Navy locate and sink Nazi U-Boats, forcing the Germans to create a new weapon to deal with the Allies secret weapon. When years later the Navy finds intelligent activity among dolphins, they may also know who is teaching them.",
