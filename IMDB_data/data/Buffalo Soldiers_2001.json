        "reviewBody": "It's difficult to sum Buffalo Soldiers up. On one hand you have the comedy aspect, particularly from Ed Harris, on another you have the romance, from Anna Paquin, and then you have the violence...from just about everybody. The story is set in Germany, 1989, just before the fall of the Berlin Wall, and is based on a unit of the US army called the Buffalo infantry (Or something) who aren't exactly above board and legal with what they get up to. Truth is this movie really isn't to do with army combat, it's to do with the corruption of the vast majority of the soldiers who'll do anything to make a buck, such as drugs and weapons.\n\nDark comedy in many places, it seems many have taken great offence to Hollywood's portrayal of their 'heroes' - for goodness' sake don't take it so seriously. I'm jewish and don't care when I see my religion mocked on screen. So why should anyone be offended by this?\n\nIt's funny in places, dramatic in places, dark in places and risque. But what it is is a good movie which *will* entertain."
