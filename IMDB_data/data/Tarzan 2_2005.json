        "reviewBody": "This was much better than I had originally anticipated. That's just the cold hard truth. This is the story of Tarzan as a young boy, with all of his young friends, having fun. This is a great movie for children, mostly those between the ages of about 5 and 12, who will enjoy it the most. And parents will like the story line too, it is a good thing to talk to your children about. What to do in the situation, and what NOT to do. It seems as though Disney is trying to put these movies out as fast as they can now, but I don't think this one was for the money. They did take time on this video to make sure it was WORTH buying, and believe me, it is. And if you want this title, you can find good, inexpensive ones at either HTTP://www.amazon.com ,or HTTP://www.ebay.com. Thats my story, and I'm sticking to it!! This was a good movie, and I gave it an 8 of 10.",
