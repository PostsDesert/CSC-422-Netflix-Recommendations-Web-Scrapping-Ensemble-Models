        "reviewBody": "Well like my title suggests, this anime has a nun with guns. Correction numerous nuns with guns. Also this has nothing to do with the Chrono Trigger/Cross games. Heck it's nothing near it unless the new games feature a nun with a gun. Sorry just saying that phrase is fun because it's so unlikely. Also a note I have only watched the Japanese version so my review is only looking at that part of it. But that is the great thing about DVDs right? You can watch it in 2 languages! This is set in 1928 AD in the United States, mostly New York and San Fransisco are mentioned. But I was surprised enough that it was actually set in the States, a lot of anime isn't is all I am saying.\n\nThe main characters are Rosette Christopher and her (caddy) friend Chrno (Chrono depending on which version you are used to). Rosette is apart of the Magadalan order who battle demons that are terrorizing everything. But there is something that the public doesn't know about the Order and that is that there is a demon that is working in the Order. Of course this demon isn't bad, but he was and he is trying to atone for his sins.\n\nRosette is looking for her younger brother Joshua, so Rosette and Chrno are on a journey to find where her brother is. They meet interesting characters along the way well some are interesting and some are annoying as hell *cough* Azmaria *cough* Chrono Crusade is enjoyable but short considering it is only 24 episodes long. It has its funny parts but also its serious parts. I was crying so badly while watching the last 3 episodes one after another. It was a snowballing effect and really pulled at my heart strings.\n\nI give Chrono Crusade a 3 and a half out of 5. I would give it a 4 but the problem with filler episodes when it's only 24 episodes is terrible. Overall story is nice, the background music is so fitting and the voicing apart from Azmaria's is nice to listen to.\n\nSo give this anime a try, if I didn't get you with my title then hopefully I convinced you with my review. And just one more push, I mean really how often are you able to watch something with a nun with guns anyways?"
