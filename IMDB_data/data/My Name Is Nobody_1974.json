        "reviewBody": "This spaghetti-in-cheek western from Sergio Leone and crew (direction credit went to Leone protégé Tonino Valerii) opens with déjà vu. Haven't we seen Henry Fonda getting shaved before, wondering if the barber's going to slit his throat? \n\nReferencing his own \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" of five years earlier, idea-man Leone also pays satirical homage to perhaps the bloodiest western in history by inserting \"the wild bunch\" into this film as a band of one hundred, fifty men who appear only and repeatedly as a thundering herd in Leone-signature panoramas, accompanied by another impressive Ennio Morricone score, a herd which would-be greatest gunslinger, Nobody, proposes that Fonda's character face single-handedly to get him into the history books before Nobody draws him down. (Making the reference explicit, Nobody reads \"Sam Peckinpah\" off a grave marker in the scene leading to the first appearance here of \"the wild bunch.\") \n\nAs derivative as this movie may be, it's still enjoyable for its performances, its photography, its score, its style, its \"twist\" ending, its speed-up scenes which give Nobody's antics a silent Chaplin hearkening, and its one-off take on the spaghetti western which Leone made popular."
