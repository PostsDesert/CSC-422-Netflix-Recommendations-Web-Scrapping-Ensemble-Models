        "reviewBody": "This may just be the weakest of Sammi Cheng's romantic comedies because so much time was spent diverging from Sammi's plot line. Sammi does a reasonable job as a scandal sheet reporter and no doubt enjoyed seeing what life was like on the other end of a tabloid headline for a change. Louis Koo is decent as a heartthrob cop when he's not foaming at the mouth. But pitting Charlene Choi (from Twins) as Sean Lau's (Ching Wan Lau) love interest seems alarmingly illegal. She also looks too much like his teenage daughter to make things seem wholesome. He's way too old for her and her overly juvenile antics. She might be old enough but she looks and acts here like she's barely in high school.\n\nIt's almost as if the writer was combining two movies in one (Cheng & Koo; Choi & Lau) and couldn't decide which was the primary plot line. Maybe if less time had been devoted to Sammi's ex-boyfriend and his jail-bait flame and more time on Koo & Cheng this would have been a stronger film.\n\nPlagued by silliness and what seemed like an interminable stretch with Lau and Choi, it does have some good moments with Sandra Ng doing what she does best-- stealing laughs. Not the worst, and there are worse ways to spend to your time.",
