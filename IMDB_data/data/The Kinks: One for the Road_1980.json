Their songs have been covered by many bands including the Pretenders and Van Halen.\n\n The filming and editing are perhaps a bit dated, but that possibly adds to the charm of the performance. The Kinks were never the most polished act in the business, but they have always come across as an honest group that wasn't just in it for the money.\n\nThe video is probably a bit difficult to find these days but is well worth the effort to look up, for old and new fans alike!",
