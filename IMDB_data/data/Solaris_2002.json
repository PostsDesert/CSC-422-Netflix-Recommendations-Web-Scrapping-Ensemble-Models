Soderbergh has managed to leave out just about everything that could justify the title (as Lem himself put it, if he had set out to write a book about space romance, he would have called it Love in Outer Space, not Solaris). So if you want to know the story, go and read the novel.\n\nThat said, I enjoyed Jeremy Davis as Snow, and the score is very good."
