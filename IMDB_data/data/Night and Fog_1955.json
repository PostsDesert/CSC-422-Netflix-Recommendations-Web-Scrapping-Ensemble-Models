But I was just totally unprepared for this. It was thirty harrowing minutes of a sight-seeing tour of hell.\n\nIt was so difficult for me to sit through that I was tempted to shut the DVD player off three times, but I told myself, \"No, this is important. It has to be seen, if only as a reminder of what can happen when an inhuman world-view is fused to state-of-the-art technology.\" The Holocaust was far more (and worse) than simple mass-killing, awful as that is. It was a business decision, coolly and scientifically calculated, to destroy millions of innocents while reaping a profit from them- in death as well as in life.\n\nThe sight of the starved, broken bodies, the ghastly scenes taken in the medical labs in the death camps, the sight of little children being led by the hand to their last train ride. It is all so monstrous as to be indescribable.\n\nI am glad I watched it. But I do not think that I'll be watching it ever again, and I give it a 10. It affected me that deeply.",
