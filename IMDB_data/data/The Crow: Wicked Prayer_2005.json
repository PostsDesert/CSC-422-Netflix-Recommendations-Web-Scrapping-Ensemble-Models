        "reviewBody": "Watched The film with an open mind thinking the film wouldn't be that bad!! How wrong i was the plot makes no sense at all, unlike the original film the actors are all wooden and seem to have no sense of what the legacy and style of the Crow is all about. The plot of the graphic novel of the same name is completely different. At Times the film almost seems like a bad parody of the original with some frames lifted directly from it. The problem with all the sequels is the budget is never enough and also James O'Barr doesn't seem to want to have anything do with it. Also why the hell was dennis hopper in it? he popped up from no where acted everyone under the table and then had the worlds crappiest death.",
