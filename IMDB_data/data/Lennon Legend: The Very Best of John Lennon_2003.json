It is not many facts about John Lennon or so, it's not that kind of film, but it includes all of his and Yoko's hits and so many wonderful pictures of them; films that John has taped himself and that others have taped on him. You really get many feelings of this DVD, and I'm not a person who normally gets very emotional! Anyhow, it's really great to watch it and even though there isn't anyone telling a story in the background, you still feel like you get to know so much about John and Yoko.",
