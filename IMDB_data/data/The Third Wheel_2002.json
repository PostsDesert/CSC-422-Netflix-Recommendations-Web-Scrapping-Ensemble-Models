Barely half way into the film the girlfriend fell asleep and i turned off and was left feeling frustrated and angry at wasting the Â£2 on hiring it.\n\nFirstly i just wanted to slap Luke Wilson and tell him to pull himself together. The character he played was such a wet lettuce it was unbelievable, and Phil was sooooooo annoying you were left wishing that he would sustain a more serious injury throughout the film...\n\nArgh!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nNot recommended!"
