        "reviewBody": "This film is about a doomed relationship between the daughter of a rich fascist-type landowner in Argentina about 1830 or so (after the successful revolution against the Spanish). The new government, it seems, feels that the end justifies the means and repression is used to keep control of the fledgling nation.\n\nCamila finds that she is not attracted to the macho rich suitors but instead finds herself drawn to the new Jesuit priest. Despite common sense and many obstacles, they run off together. What I found most interesting in the movie was the character of her father, who was instrumental in tracking them down and exacting punishment.\n\nIn many ways, the plot reminded me of The Thorn Bird mini-series combined with a fascist-like backdrop. A pretty good film overall. Be aware, however, of the nudity. It's NOT as much as you might expect in such a film but considering he's a priest, it's bound to offend some.",
