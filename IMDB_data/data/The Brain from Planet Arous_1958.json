It's one of those movies that is so bad, that it's pretty good (or at least not a complete waste of time). I especially like the scene where Agar's character, while driving a jeep through the desert, crashes into a huge rock that he couldn't possibly have missed, then says something like \"well, I guess we walk from here.\" The ending is completely beyond belief; you have to see it to believe anyone would end a movie like that.",
