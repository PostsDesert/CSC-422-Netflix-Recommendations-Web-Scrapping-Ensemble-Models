The film started well and I settled in expecting to be amazed.\n\nThen Pinocchio spoke, and I saw Roberto Benigni as the wooden puppet who longed to be a boy. WOW was that bad casting! I couldn't keep track of the amount of times I winced in pain and rolled my eyes as Benigni, a middle-aged man, ran around like a spoiled brat spouting things many 3-year olds have outgrown. I must admit I wanted to make kindling of this puppet.\n\nWorth seeing for the set pieces, costumes and effects. Too bad we can't edit out the parts with Pinocchio!\n\n5 out of 10 (all 5 for the sets and costumes).",
