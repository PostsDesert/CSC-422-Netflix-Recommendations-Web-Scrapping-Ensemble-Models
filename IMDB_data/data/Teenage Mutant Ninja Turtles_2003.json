When I heard they were bringing back the turtles i was expecting a show very much like the show i grew up watching, insted what i got was something i never expected, insted of the chessy jokes and endless pizza refrences I saw a half hour of butt kicking, turtle excitement. Based more on the comic book then the original this new series is darker and more action oriented then the original. With the shredder who is totally evil and doesn't tolerate failure. and deals out a harsh punishment to whomever fails him. Case in point with Dr. Baxter Stockman whom has his left eye taken out when his mouser robots fail in there duties. The style of animation is reminnesent of \"Batman Beyond\" and it's action is unmatched, no other show has it's delightfull mix of action and comedy, but it's not totaly unlike it's predecessor, mikey is still as goofy as ever, leo is still the leader, donny is still the smart one, raph is- well raph is raph, and splinter is the calm soul who holds the group together. so i suggest if your a child of the 80's like me and are one with your inner child check it out Saturday mornings on the fox box check your local listings for time and channel."
