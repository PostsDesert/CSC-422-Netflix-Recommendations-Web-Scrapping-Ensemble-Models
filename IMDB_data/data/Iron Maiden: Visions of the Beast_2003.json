You gotta hand it to these guys, before metal became \"cool\" again with the hipsters (ie: the Darkness), these honorable rockers just kept pumping out what they knew best: METAL!!!! Free of pretension (unlike hipster-metal), they just do what works for them, and it rules. Everything a cool person should be into is covered here: satan, world war II, indians. Yeah, this DVD is great, although the menu is a little over achieving. But, the content rules. Metal rules. Maiden rules.",
