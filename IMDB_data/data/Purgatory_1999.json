        "reviewBody": "This was a really satisfying story with great performances from the actors, even Eric Roberts who usually annoys me.\n\nThe basic story is that a band of outlaws heading for Mexico get waylaid in a town called refuge where no pone carries a gun and everyone welcomes them with open arms. But like the rattlesnakes they are, instead of accepting and appreciating this hospitality the outlaws decide to take the town for all it's worth not realising exactly what kind of place they have ridden into.\n\nThis film is exactly the type of thing you get when an interesting premise is properly executed. A real treat that I only found by accident on late night TV!",
