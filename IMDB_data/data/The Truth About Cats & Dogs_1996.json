        "reviewBody": "When I read the synopsis for \"The Truth About Cats & Dogs\" I was hoping that it would not be another one of those overly sappy and corny romantic comedy that the movie industry tends to spew out by the dozens. And I was hoping it would be more than such, especially because it had Janeane Garofalo on the cast list.\n\nI sat down to watch it in 2016, 20 years after it was released. And this was actually the first time that I have seen it, believe it or not.\n\nAnd it turned out that \"The Truth About Cats & Dogs\" was a rather enjoyable movie, and one that did offer a bit more than your average run-of-the-mill romantic comedies.\n\nThe story is about low self-esteemed radio show host Abby who gives a caller named Brian some good advice on how to befriend a dog. And when Brian wants to repay her for her helpful advice, Abby turns to Noelle, a tall model living in her building, to stand in for her and pretend to be her.\n\nOf course, there are elements of classic romantic comedy to \"The Truth About Cats & Dogs\", but it does have more than just that. I liked the aspect of the switched roles and pretending to be someone you are not, as it offered a different approach to the story.\n\nAnd the cast in \"The Truth About Cats & Dogs\" was just phenomenal. Uma Thurman and Ben Chaplin were doing great jobs and were nicely cast. However, it was Jeneane Garofalo who stole the scene, without a doubt. With her amazing on-screen charisma and presence, she just carried the movie so well on her shoulders. She was an absolute delight to witness in this movie.\n\nI was more than genuinely entertained by \"The Truth About Cats & Dogs\" and it turned out to be a much better movie than I had hoped. So if you haven't already seen his movie, and if you enjoy romantic comedies, then I can more than warmly recommend that you take the time to sit down and watch \"The Truth About Cats & Dogs\".\n\n\"The Truth About Cats & Dogs\" scores a solid six out of ten stars rating from me.",
