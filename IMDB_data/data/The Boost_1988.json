One criticist stated that it was difficult to see any difference between J Woods \"before\" and \"after\", just as with J Nicholson in \"the Shining\". He may be true there, but taking things not too seriously, this is a believable and well-acted movie. To put it simply: It could have happened in real life.\n\nI wouldn't rate this as a masterpiece, but given the good performances of Young and Woods, it's clearly above average.\n\nYes, it is an anti-drug film, but if you are against drugs you should see it. If you're pro-drugs, it is even more important for you to see it!"
