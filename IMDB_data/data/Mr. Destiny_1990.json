Convinced that his life would have turned out better had he made a home run instead of a miss in a ball game in his high school years, he gets the chance to see how his life would have turned out had he hit that ball. And what a difference it did make.\n\nA simple and charming little sleeper, Mr. Destiny plays it's It's a Wonderful Life scenario in good fashion. James Belushi gives an endearing performance and manages to keep his cool throughout. Linda Hamilton and Michael Caine give good support and an array of familiar faces (Rene Russo, Jon Lovitz, Courtney Cox, Hart Bochner) add to the pleasure. Film is overall free of slapstick humor and plays it straight and it does have some very humorous moments. And a good message as well.\n\nOn the whole Mr. Destiny delights undemanding viewers who could do a lot worse than this film.",
