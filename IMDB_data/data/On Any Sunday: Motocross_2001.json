But the one that stood out from all the rest was \"On Any Sunday\", a motorcycle film that still bears repeated viewings.\n\nFrom what I understand, it was the film that actually introduced professional motocross racing to the rest of the country. It reminded me a lot of the 80s when I first started on trail bikes and then went to Enduro 2-strokes. I've since given up riding like that for the sake of the family, but man, it did bring back a lot of memories...\n\nI wish I had seen it before the TCM showing but I never got around to it. Talk about falling through the radar!",

        "description": "Mention the name Bruce Brown in any crowd and someone will reply: Â“He is the reason I rideÂ”. \r\n\r\nFeaturing Steve McQueen with music by the famed Dominick Fronteirie, this is without a doubt the quintessential motorcycle film, now digitally re-mastered and loaded with never-before-seen extras.\r\n\r\nAcademy AwardÂ® nominated Bruce Brown highlighted this intoxicating race world filled with rugged road riders and the grueling excitement of muddy and murderous motocross, daring dune riding, slicing the ice and the tortuous mayhem of the Baja 1000. \r\n\r\nThe grandfather of motorcycle sport filmmaking now greets a new breed of sport riders and filmmakers, which include sons Dana and Wade, and grandson Wes with partner T.J. Barrack - all of whom had a hand in the Bonus Features for this incredible new DVD set. Wherever a reason, whatever the season, Bruce and his friends for decades, with familiar names like Malcolm and Mert, along with the new breed of riders, taking the sport to the extreme, can conjure up stories and tales of how they Â“almost made it, jumped it, ate it, killed it or trashed itÂ” on practically every Sunday.",
