The amount of research and professionals involved in the making of the film make it a believeable documentary on the topic of all aspects of life after death. From haunted forests to ghosts and mediums, the makers of this film looked at the topics with a critical eye and provided arguments both for and against each of their subjects. Looking forward to watching it again. Kudos to the Ink and Quill Society aka the Paranormal Scholar for the excellent film they have made!",
