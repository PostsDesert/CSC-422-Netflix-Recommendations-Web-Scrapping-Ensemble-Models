        "reviewBody": "This movie has some of the best film noir photography I have seen in all the Charlie Chan entries. This is one I am still waiting to have issued on DVD, so I can enjoy those visuals.\n\nStorywise, it's a decent story with an interesting cast of suspects. My complaint is fairly minor: it is a little below-average in the amount of humorous Charlie Chan proverbs that we Chan fans love so much. Otherwise, I enjoyed the movie.\n\nAlthough not Charlie's official chauffeur-assistant in here as he was in most of these Monogram Chan films, Mantan Moreland (\"Birmingham Brown\") plays his usual role as a guy helping out and adding humor. He's a likable guy as are all of Charlie's kids, two of them joining in this mystery. We get Number Three Son \"Tommie\" (Benson Fong) and daughter \"Iris\" (Marianne Quon. Chan's kids are always nosy, goodhearted and, in the latter-day films, not that helpful.\n\nA few quick action scenes help keep things rolling and, as usual, we get Charlie's summary of the case at the end in which our hero exposes the crook. Overall, is this a great Charlie Chan film? No, it's average....but just average is still good to me. I love these films and hope all of them eventually are available on disc.",
