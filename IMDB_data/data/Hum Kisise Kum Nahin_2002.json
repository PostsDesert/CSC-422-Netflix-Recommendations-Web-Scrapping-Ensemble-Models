Something very different from his regular cast.\n\nStarting with the cast! Sanjay, Amitabh, Aish and Ajay all do a great job! While the rest are okay, it is Amitabh who shines as the aware and alert doctor who tries his very best to keep away from all the troubles.\n\nAish is good as usual, it was a very fresh script for her as compared to her regulars. Ajay and Sanjay bring the best on screen chemistry as two obsessed lovers over the same girl.\n\nThis is not your regular hero heroine villan stuf, but you will still be happy and atleast laugh a bit, no matter what.\n\nSo, incase you are looking forward to a good time, be ready to have a popcorn in your hand and just sit back and tune onto this film for sure!\n\nOverall, a wonderful film.",
