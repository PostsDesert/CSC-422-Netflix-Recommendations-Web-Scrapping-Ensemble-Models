        "reviewBody": "Dinosaur Planet was made in 2003 and in a way is the American counterpart of Walking with Dinosaurs and it more of a focus on a specific dinosaur rather than a safari ,like the Original. To be honest the cgi here has not aged as well as the Walking series and the fact that the environments were digitally edited ,also alienated me for I was used to cgi creatures into a real environment, with no editing in the environment. This are the drawbacks of the series, but its pros are far more strong and important. For instance the series show you fascinating new things you certainly ignore about the dinosaurs and the fact that it is a focus series allows you to understand how the creature feel, though I have to admit that on occasion ,it becomes a bit anthropomorphistic, seen it with human qualities, which is a little selfish. However the overall experience of this documentary was a nice one and the series is available online so ,I recommended to watch it, is for certain a fun ,informative ride dispute the forgiving flaws it has.",
