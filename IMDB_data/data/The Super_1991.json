But as he is sentenced to live in one of his worst maintained buildings, he is forced to learn several lessons about life. Not everyone likes this type of humor, but if you liked Joe Pesci in My Cousin Vinnie I would be sure to watch this movie. As the tight-wad Super, most of the jokes are at Pesci's character's expense. However, it still leaves room for Pesci's particular style of humor. The \"love\" story is pretty typical but in no way detracts from the movie. The people he becomes involved with could be anybody living anywhere in the US. There are not many recognizable names in this movie but has some familiar faces that I remember from other movies. I found this to be a hilarious movie and wholly recommend it.",
