I didn't really understand the humor back then, but this movie can make me laugh out loud.\n\nWith all due respect to George Burns (RIP), Walter Matthau really deserved the Oscar for this film. His performance is amazing--given the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character, Willie Clark. His mannerisms are first-rate. (\"You know what kind of songs he wrote? Sh*t!\" and when speaking to the Spanish-speaking guy at the front desk: \"No! No! No enchilada!!\") Absolutely hilarious!\n\nKudos to Richard Benjamin, who played straight man to Matthau.\n\nI just wish this was on DVD, because my VHS recording is getting a bit old.\n\nI had no interest in seeing the remake with Woody Allen, because in no way can it match the original.",
