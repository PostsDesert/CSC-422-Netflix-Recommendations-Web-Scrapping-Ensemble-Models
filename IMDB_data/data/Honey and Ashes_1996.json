        "reviewBody": "HONEY AND ASHES is about three women who live in a North African Islamic country. Each has a different life. Leila is a headstrong, intelligent student. Naima is a doctor with a young daughter, and Amina is a housewife also with a daughter.\n\nDespite their differences, they have something in common. They are caught between the modern and traditional rules for a woman because they live in a patriarchal society.\n\nLeila has to hide her feelings for her true love from her strict father; Naima's family forces her into an unwanted arranged marriage; and Amina's husband, a popular university professor, constantly abuses her.\n\nThe three storylines captivated me. It is very raw, very real, and in many ways very sad. Despite the circumstances, the film also shows the strength of women.\n\nHONEY AND ASHES is a striking view of the lives of some women. It is a compelling film to watch.",
