        "reviewBody": "Walking with Cavemen is a spin-off of shorts of the Walking With series and its central story is the evolution of homo sapiens, the humans or more simply us. I was amazed when I first saw it ,because I lucked any idea how we came in to being apart of what it is written in the bible. To add, the producers here made a very clever choice: unlike the previous Walking the main creatures are made by actors in suits ,which makes perfect sense considering that they are either our ancestor or close relatives. This documentary has quit engaging stories and you are going to feel that in the end, we are them and Humans have practically zero differences with the rest of the animal kingdom. One other great think is that ,though a spin-off it does not try to copy the rest Walkings, but be a being in its own right, unlike what is usually the case. The only reason why I have not give it a 10/10 is that the science is a bit inaccurate when it comes to who we start to walking up right and the first of its four episodes it is bit slow ,but apart from this nit picks it is perfect. In the end not hear those who say that it is awful or that we are the chosen ones of God, because that is rubbish and we are as part of this planet as we are the creature that create civilization. Go watch and if your liked the previous Walking ,you are going to like this one also.",
