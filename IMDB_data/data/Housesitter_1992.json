        "reviewBody": "It's truly refreshing to see an intelligent movie with so much crap coming out of Hollywood these days. The fact that this was released in 1992 does not say much about what Hollywood has produced since.\n\nI've always loved Steve Martin. I think he's one of the most underrated actors in the past 30yrs. Sure he's not been in a million pictures, but the old adage sticks; quality, not quantity. Goldie Hawn is one of the most honest and lovely actresses to grace the silver screen. This movie would pale in comparison if these two actors were not involved. They deliver the goods in more ways than one.\n\nBeyond Martin and Hawn, this picture is special for it's writing. Mark Stein should be patted on the back and then some. Wow, is all I have to say. You can tell how much thought was put into every scene by the \"believable\" detail that's generously provided throughout the entire movie. The intricate interplay and \"make believe\" between Martin and Hawn is nothing short of genius.\n\nFeel good movie? Check. Intelligent, funny? Check. Worth a watch? Absolutely!"
