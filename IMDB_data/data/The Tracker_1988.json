        "reviewBody": "The Tracker is a made for HBO western movie starring Kris Kristopher son.Kistopherson is perfect for this role and in my opinion, very underrated as an actor. He must come out of retirement to track down a vicious gang. Scott Wilson is great also as the leader of the gang as well as a psychotic holy roller. The story moves along at a steady pacea looks great as well. The acting and characterization is also pretty solid and has the right amount of action and gunplay. Overall, I thought The Tracker was quite good and should please most fans of the genre. It definitely is deserving of more fanfare and was a well made western.",
