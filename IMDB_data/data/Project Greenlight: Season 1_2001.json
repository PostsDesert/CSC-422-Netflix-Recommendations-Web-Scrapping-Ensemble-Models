I found myself cheering for the people that made good(or at least better) choices against the wimpy, whinny directors wishes. He had no vision of the script, his response to every thing was \"I don't know what I'm looking for, but I'll know when I see it\". I'm sure he had no clue what he was looking for, but I'm equally sure he wouldn't know a good thing if it bit him in his considerably large back end. This is just another reality show, which is too bad. And the griping about Miramax/Disney politics seemed very play acted to me. There couldn't be an ounce of the real thing here. I only feel sorry for the talented people that probably tried to get a break from this staged nonsense."
