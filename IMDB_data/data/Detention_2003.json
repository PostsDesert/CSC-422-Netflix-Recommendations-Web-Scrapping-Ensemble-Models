The acting was terrible. and there were so many things in this film that were so pathetic is was unbelievable. I mean, the bad guys looked like they belonged in Layztown. They could not shoot a non moving target, let alone students running away from them.\n\nThere was one scene where it felt like the A-Team. The students were hiding out in the Gym at their school, but in the gym just so happened to be an archery set all ready for them.\n\nI still don't fully understand why the bad guys were in the school in the first place.\n\nHonestly, this is a really bad B movie... funny in places, but not for the right reasons.\n\nI will give this film 4 out of 10.\n\nDolph is lucky Stallone even called him for the Expendables after this film.\n\nFor more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",
