        "reviewBody": "David Moreton and Dennis Hensley did a fantastic job with their screen adaptation of James Robert Baker's novel 'Testosterone.' David Moreton's second-only turn in the Director's chair is impressive, as was his choice of locations. Buenos Aires is one of the most striking and remarkable cities on the planet. The Argentine people are sophisticated and intriguing -- exactly what this story demands. Wonderful costume design highlights the Porte√±os' eye for fashion. In addition, the original music is light and amusing when it should be, turning dark and captivating just when it is vital.\n\nThe casting was virtually perfect. David Sutcliffe and Celina Font bring 'Dean' and 'Sofia' to life as if they were born to play the characters. Antonio Sabato Jr as 'Pablo' IS the quintessential Latin lover. As always, Jennifer Coolidge offers us laughter, this time giving us the take-no-crap 'Louise'. Leonardo Brzezicki's 'Marcos' takes us from distrust and contempt, to empathy and compassion. This guy is a true 'find' -- let us see more from him soon. Then the amazing Sonia Braga delivers 'Mrs Alesandro' at a level of outstanding few others could achieve.\n\n'Testosterone' will make you a bit sad, let you have a few laughs, remind you we have all made at least one bad relationship choice, offer one mans decision on how he will reach closure, and will keep you thinking for days to follow.\n\n'Awful?' 'Dreadful?' 'Terrible?' Harsh for a film that never claims to be an epic blockbuster. Moreover, if this was such a bad project, one wonders why do so many have rather deep questions into the characters, their motivations, and interconnections. Not to mention the seemingly endless quest to figure out the true meaning behind this films ending.\n\nIf you are looking to be entertained and a bit challenged, with a sufficient amount of foreign culture and 'eye candy' to ensure your attention is held, you need to see David Moreton's 'Testosterone.'"
