        "reviewBody": "Like a good relationship that goes sour, \"Heartburn\" is impossible to love but hard to write off entirely. Despite its fine cast and script by Nora Ephron, the film is disjointed and, ultimately, dishonest.\n\nMeryl Streep and Jack Nicholson play two Washington journalists who meet at a wedding, and  seemingly in the next scene  are saying their own vows. The developments that follow in their relationship are just as abrupt and just as believable. The rapid-fire pace of their many separations and reconciliations stretches credibility to the limit, and it's hard to generate any interest in these characters when it was never clear what drew them together in the first place.\n\nStreep does a fine job as magazine writer Rachel, but Nicholson's cad is all too familiar in his role of Mark, the womanizing columnist. Supporting players Stockard Channing, Maureen Stapleton, Jeff Daniels and Kevin Spacey, while uniformly excellent, seem underutilized and distract from the main plot.\n\n\"Heartburn\" is worth watching, if only for its strong cast, but it's as memorable as leftover lasagna."
