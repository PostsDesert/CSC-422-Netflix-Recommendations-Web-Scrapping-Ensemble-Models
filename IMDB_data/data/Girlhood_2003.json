It isn't everyday a female teacher gets a chance to see a story about girls who are being lost and left by the wayside.\n\nWhatever happens with the class clown who just seems to have one or two social problems? Do they go on to reform themselves and be a girl makes good story? Or do they just sink down into a pit of their own making? This documentary is one about two ladies in Baltimore, Maryland. The story might play out differently if people live in different parts of the United States. It even might be common enough where a street smart person might say, \"Yes and?\" For everyone else, it can be devastating.\n\nThese ladies are smart, pretty, idealistic and ambitious. How did they wind up incarcerated at such a young age? Will they make it? The filmmaker just tells you about their circumstances. She doesn't have to go into depth for those of us familiar with the statistics. If you like documentaries and want to find out more, make use of the resources mentioned in the DVD extras and take another step.\n\nIt is worth your time and your understanding.",
