        "reviewBody": "Cindy Crawford is probably the only model out there that doesn't annoy the crap out of me. In this video, instead of constantly showing herself and/or perfectly toned athletic people, a good deal of it takes place in a basement work-out room, where she works out along with us under her instructor, Radu. We see her looking less-than-perfect (yet still beautiful), breaking a sweat, out-of-breath, gulping at her water just the same as we do. As someone who gets PO'd when watching work-out videos where the instructors do every move flawlessly, while I'm fumbling along like a paraplegic walrus, this means a great deal to me.\n\nRadu often counts the moves too fast (I guess he didn't realize that he's not just instructing Cindy in this instance, but all of us), and some of the exercises might be slightly out-of-date (since physical fitness standards are constantly changing). I just adapt the routines to fit what I believe is the current standard. It's the only work-out video I still use, because it remains unpretentious and understandable.",
