Now I am a thirtysomething adult woman and it still fills my heart with joy when I watch the film. Astrid Lindgren has really written one of the most beautiful children's books in the literature history and all the Swedish Pippi Longstocking movies are absolutely awesome. Georg Riedel has also written a memorable and wonderful title song.",
