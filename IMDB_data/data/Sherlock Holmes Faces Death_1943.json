A modern comparison can be made between the chess game in this movie and the one in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Even though no one actually died in Potter's game, murder surrounded the Musgrave Ritual -- so which one could be deemed more violent? Both movies arrived at the mysteries' solutions after the completion of the game, so there's another loose comparison."
