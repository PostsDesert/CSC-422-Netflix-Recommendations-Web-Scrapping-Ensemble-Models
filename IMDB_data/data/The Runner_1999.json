        "reviewBody": "John Goodman is a supporting actor in this movie the same way that Atlas supported the Earth in Greek mythology. First, let us dispel any notion of realism. Goodman plays a sport gambler who beats the house so often that he has his own cadre of runners and soldiers. (In real life such men ARE the casino sport books). Instead of examining this fascinating character, we are thrust into the lives of the pretty boy/girl leads Arquette and Ellard. The end result was an obvious \"producer's instrument\" designed to advance young cinematic careers as much as make a buck. The Runner (Ellard) should have been The 'Sportwonk' (Goodman). Missed exciting themes were How does he beat the books? How does he get his info? Is he mobbed up? What is the life of a winning sports gambler like? Still, the finale is very exciting and worth the price of rental. If you like OC, buy it.",
