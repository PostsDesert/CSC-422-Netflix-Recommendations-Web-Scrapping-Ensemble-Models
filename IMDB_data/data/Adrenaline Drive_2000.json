        "reviewBody": "Everyone can find laughs and enjoyment in this movie, an unpredictable twist on a familiar theme. The lead actors are completely charming and natural, making their somewhat pitiful characters attractive and endearing. One truly hilarious episode deals with an explosion, showing a chain-of-events that is logical, comical and a bit frightening.\n\nEven the secondary characters shine in their roles, and the movie allows them time to bring their characters to life. The strict head nurse from the hospital explores her dark side while the nastiest gangster is humbled by medical procedures and a limited capacity.\n\nSure there are some cliches, like the mousey nurse transforming into a stylish vixen, and the inept thugs who don't have a clue, or the strategically placed pickup truck that leaves at precisely the right moment. But it's all done with enough good nature and energy that makes it more than worthwhile.",
