Great fight-choreography, excellent filming, fine music and a good story. The movie takes you to a world of fighting where \"only the strongest wins\". Jean Claude van Damme as Frank Dux, a young, talented martial artist. This was THE movie for van Damme, beside Kickboxer, he has never preformed so well.\n\nWatch & Enjoy !!"
