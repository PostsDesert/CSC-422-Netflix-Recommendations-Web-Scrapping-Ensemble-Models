        "reviewBody": "The story of 'Blue Submarine 6' is in fact the idea from H.G.Wells novel 'The Island of Dr. Moreau' taken to a much larger scale, global that is. Both style and quality are very good and the computer animated scenes fit perfectly into the film, even though the series is quit short the characters are logical and not 'flat', one will find problems looking for 'black and white' thinking in this film. But most astonishing is the effect this film leaves compared to 'The Island of Dr. Moreau' and the earlier 'real actor' movies from 1933, 1977, 1996 - whereas one could easily drop of the ideas H.G.Wells might had with this novel if viewed on just a 'small ocean island' that no one knows it is hard to deny those same ideas when transfered on a global scale. So I would recommend this series as it offers both - good entertainment and some deep thoughts.\n\nmurx"
