It's a movie about a bunch of goofy characters on a mission to save some people.. I think. Either way, it is TOTAL fantasy with that strange slapsticky Asian comedy that us westerners just don't quite get. Totally off the hook, and here's the clincher. Jackie isn't even a main character! Just an old movie he did as a favor for Jimmy Wang Yu (I think) repackaged under Jackie's name for obvious reasons (moolah).\n\nDefinitely one of the strangest movies I have ever seen."
