They think up of devious plans to break Clarice and Roger up so Roger and Dianne can get married. Amanda lives in an orphanage and Dianne is her social worker. Amanda loves Dianne so much and wants to be adopted by her. Dianne feels the same way too about Amanda but the authorities say that Amanda needs a family.It is the coolest film ever and anyone out there should watch it because it does make you laugh and cry."
