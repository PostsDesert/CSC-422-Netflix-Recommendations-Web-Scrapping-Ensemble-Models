Watching it now, It's still pretty good. The first story is way too short. It deserves a full ninety minute treatment. The second story is pretty obvious. The third story is, hands down, the best of the bunch. The last one was the cause of many bad dreams way back when. \"Trilogy of Terror\" is definitely worth the watch.",
