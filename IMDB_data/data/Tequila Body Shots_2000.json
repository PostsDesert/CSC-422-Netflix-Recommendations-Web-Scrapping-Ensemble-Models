        "reviewBody": "While \"Tequila Body Shots\" ranks in my personal top five worst movies ever made, it is definitely memorable. A film so wretched Jim Varney would have winced, it raises the question \"who gave this tripe the greenlight?\" That being said, it was impossible for me to turn away. I caught the movie inadvertently on cable and could do nothing but follow it through to its bitter end. The effects, the acting, the final denouement involving the movie's namesake all coalesce to make a cinematic masterpiece in shame. Joey Lawrence has grown up, and after doing that movie should have thrown up. Worth watching just to realize that every other movie you thought was bad actually wasn't THAT bad."
