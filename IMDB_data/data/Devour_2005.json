        "reviewBody": "Well acted and shot snore-fest by director David Winkler, tells the story of a computer program linked to Satan himself. Basically just another psychological thriller with out much substance, the story sputters along at the same speed as sheep jumping over a fence. It does have some decent gore scenes, but they are too few and way too far in between, and chances are you will miss them due to the fact that you are sleeping, which makes \"Devour\" almost impossible to pay attention to. The plot involves a collage student who's (Bobby Brady-looking) best friend introduces him to a internet program (as a gift)that turns his dismal life upside down. Certainly not the worst premise, but it's slow pace makes it so boring that I actually fell asleep four times trying to make it through this. Perfect evening's viewing for anyone suffering from insomnia, as I found it more effective then NyQuil... Yawn.",
