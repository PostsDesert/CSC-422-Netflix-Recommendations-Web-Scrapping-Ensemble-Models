BUT, he had plenty of good things to work with including well written and intelligent scripts and excellent production values.\n\nQuality story telling has become something of a lost art in present day films and TV. It's all noise, special effects and four letter words now. Mr Stack was blessed with a fine voice and an authoritative screen presence. His style of presentation reminded me of a top radio talent.\n\nDramatic impact is much more effectively generated by using a slow, deliberate style of delivery rather than waving your hands about, ranting and raving. The use of dramatized recreations in the flashback scenes of this series were always masterfully handled.\n\nI continue to comb the program guide regularly to see if this terrific show has resurfaced. I'm still waiting ."
