        "reviewBody": "I have seen several other reviews here that are really negative, and I could not disagree more. In fact, I am jealous that Australians get quality television like this, and we get trash like Survivor, American Idol, and Fear Factor. I am 49, my 8 year old daughter got me started watching. The photography is beautiful, the plot lines well developed, the acting is excellent. The values taught by the show are universal and good. It is also nice to see Zachary Bennett's little sister Sophie - she not only reminds me of her brother, but has some of the same qualities that made Felix a good character on Avonlea. I notice that Keenan Macwilliam's acting was good enough to get Disney's attention, because they cast her in \"Get a Clue\". Lara Jean Marshall, Heli Simpson, and Kia Luby also get my attention - quite lovely girls! Heli plays the part of Veronica - and plays \"bad\" very well, although you can tell that her character is secretly jealous of the other girls. I expect to see a lot more of these beauties in the coming years! There have been two seasons with 26 episodes each, separated by a year's haitus - so you see the girls at one age in the first season (2001), then grown up quite a bit in the second season (2003). I can't help but think that the show's popularity in the United States spurred more production - when the producers originally thought it had run its course."
