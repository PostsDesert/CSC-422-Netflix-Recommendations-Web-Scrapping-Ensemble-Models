These movies were very popular during the beginning of his career, but more recently he has fallen into doing low class Chinese comedies, so I was refreshed to see him return to his roots. I was also surprised to see that Gigi Leung did a respectful performance. I was also glad to see that she didn't sing the theme song, which was sung by Andy Lau. The first time I saw the movie I was very touched by the father son relationship that was portrayed. Overall, I feel this movie was quite good and deserves to be watched at least once."
