        "reviewBody": "I really don't understand why there are so many excessively positive user comments for this film. The story borrows heavily from lots of other films but never does anything as well as the originals.\n\nAs for being funny, I think the viewer would need to be very drunk to find it funny. Sure there are some humourous moments but they are few and far between. I doubt this film was intended to be funny apart from one scene where Christian sends a rival gang to do some of his dirty work, where it turns into farcical slapstick that's completely disjoint from the rest of the film.\n\nOlsen does a surprisingly good job of playing Christian and most of the performances are fine. It's a shame that the script is so poor. It's riddled with clich√©s and sleep inducing dialog.",
