        "reviewBody": "Its got to be one of the best anime's I've ever seen. I saw Cashaun: Robot Hunter on Sci-Fi channel's \"Saturday Anime\" block. Basically its a movie about a scientist who made a robot who's prime directive was to clean up earth and bring it back to its natural glory. The robot figured that the best way to clean up earth is to get rid of all the humans, thus getting rid of pollution and war. The scientist also made two other cyborgs. One being Cashaun and the other being a dog. Together Cashaun and his dog (whom makes Rush look mega-weak) must stop the eco-crazed robot and his henchbots from driving the human race into extinction. If you really want more on this film you'll have to go somewhere and rent it.\n\n-BlazeFoxKitsune =^.^="
