I have had him watch other DVD's for his age and he will watch for only a short time. The Baby Einstein series seems to be very educational for toddlers and preschoolers. I am looking at other DVD's in the series. The original reason this was bought by us is word of mouth, the animals and my son's name is Noah. This Baby Noah DVD blends real animal video with puppets, and some animation and word association. Some dialog is included, but mostly with this and other DVD's in the Baby Einstein series, you have classical and instrumental music playing to the background.",
