        "reviewBody": "Hollywood has done it again - plundered one of its treasures in service of the Almighty Buck. `Mr. Deeds' is, technically I guess, a remake of Frank Capra's marvelous 1936 classic `Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.' It's no surprise, perhaps, that in this less-than-literate age, the makers of `Mr. Deeds' have found it necessary to trim three words off the original film's title. But the loss of a few words is the least of this film's problems, since `Mr. Deeds' has also jettisoned the subtlety, wit and depth of the earlier film and replaced them with broad slapstick, endless pratfalls and wheezy plot mechanics that better jibe with the undemanding tastes of modern movie audiences.\n\nThe earlier film featured Gary Cooper as the na√Øve country bumpkin who, upon inheriting the fortune of an uncle he never knew he had, journeys to the Big Bad City and shows the people there a thing or two about old fashioned, small town values. The remake retains the general premise of the story, but it has a hard time making a convincing case for those values since Deeds, though we keep being told what a swell guy he is, seems to be guided by a rather questionable moral code, which is that he beats the crap out of anybody he happens not to like. In fact, that seems to be the modus operandi for a number of the people who hail from his hometown of Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire. These violence-prone country rubes don't seem too ethically removed from the callous New York City big shots we're supposed to find so appalling.\n\nMaybe it's too much to ask that an Adam Sandler comedy tone down the raucousness a bit, but the pratfalling and mugging do get to be a bit wearying after awhile. Sandler conveys a certain tone of befuddled charm at times and Winona Ryder does a nice turn as the somewhat ditzy reporter who first deceives, then eventually falls in love with this strange man from an alien world, but one only needs to see Cooper and Jean Arthur in the original roles to see how ADULTS would behave in the same circumstances. (In keeping with the semi-literate nature of the times, the Arthur character has been changed from a reporter working for a newspaper to one working for a tabloid TV news program).\n\nIn fact, every element of the original shines in comparison to its counterpart in this remake. The title is not the only thing here that has been dumbed down."
