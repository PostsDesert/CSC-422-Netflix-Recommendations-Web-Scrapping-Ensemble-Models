        "reviewBody": "France had Vidocq, the States had Attack Of The Clones and now Belgium has Hop. Thanks to Sony en Barco, director Standaert got his money to make his debut feature, only if he made it digitally! Well, the image is great, but the story is weak. This movie is about a young African kid who lives in Brussels with his father after they fled from Burundi, where their mother/wife was killed (or just died?). After an incident with their neightbours, they have to flee again. They are living in Belgium illegally and they know what that means. The father gets caught, but the young kid escapes and finds shelter at the home of an anarchist writer (Jan Decleir, from Daens and Character). To cut a long story short: the fathers gets send to Congo (yes, not to Burundi) and the writer and the kid threaten to blow up a famous Belgian landmark. (the kid already tried to blow up the Atomium, but the anarchist could prevent him doing so) The black and white photography is great, but that's the only thing great about this movie. The acting is soso, the story is ridiculous and the director blew the chance of showing the world that Flemish and French are equal in Belgium. They aren't of course, but still, you see two briljant Flemish actors who play Flemish characters and who talk French all the time!"
