        "reviewBody": "Like in \"Guarding Tess\", I think this is where Nicolas Cage is at his best, although this one takes the cake as far as his comedies go.\n\nA well-written, well-acted all around, original movie with some truly hilarious moments and enough drama and complexity to make it a solid, worth-your-while experience.\n\nJames Caan is perfect as the love-stricken gangster, and his object of affection, Sara Jessica Parker, is also great as the fiance who slowly begins to come around to his advances. (She's also quite easy to look at I might add).\n\nEverything goes wrong for Cage, as he races across hell and high water trying to catch up with the girl he wants to marry, but of course wacky high-jinx ensues. Hey, if nothing else, you can't go wrong with Las Vegas and Hawaii as your two main locations. A very good, funny film."
