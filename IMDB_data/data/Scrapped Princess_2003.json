It's also one of the first show's I've seen where I haven't gotten majorly annoyed at one of the characters. It's also one of the only shows which plot does not lag, keeping at a good pace while still taking time to explain and give detail. Every episode will leave you wanting more. The soundtrack is also superb. Everyone should watch this show, and it's great as an anime for those who have never seen the genre before. All in all, a great series."
