Oh sure.....I also thought Henry's wife Muriel and and two grown up daughters Sara and Jackie added comic relief but my all time favorite character has to be Monroe Ficus (JM J. Bullock) who was a very geeky and stupid person. He became a very big part of Henry's family in later episodes originally passed as Sara's student friend from college."
