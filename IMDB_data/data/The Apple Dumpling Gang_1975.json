A sweet story about misplaced children, an unwilling but good-intentioned gambler as a foster parent and two bumbling crooks as the comic foil. Bill Bixby, of \"My Favorite Martian\" and \"The Hulk\" fame, plays Russell Donovan, the roaming gambler who is unwittingly stuck with some \"valuables.\" Tim Conway and Don Knotts, a little past their prime, play the hapless crooks known as the \"Hash Knife Outfit.\" Susan Clark plays the tomboy stage coach driver who fills in as the kids mother. It also stars Harry Morgan as the town sheriff. Beautiful scenery, lots of action, comedy, and a fabulous saloon brawl that is the highlight of the film.",
