        "reviewBody": "Man, this show takes me back! The Jamie Foxx show was too funny for words. The things this man said and did on his show was hilarious. I use to love this character he use to play named Tryone Coppel. Tyrone Coppel was basically the black version of Ted Coppel and he would say things like \"Westside\" and \"back up off me\" in Ted Coppels voice. There were also a lot of in-jokes on this show about the city of Los Angeles, and if you don't live in LA like I do or are familiar with the city, you probably won't get them. This show followed a really simple formula but it was still hilarious. I also liked the guy who played Braxton P. Hartnabrig. This guy is responsible for coining the word \"bro-ham\" and was a funny straight man for Foxx. Uncle Junior King played by the great Garret Morris was also hilarious as Jamie's cheap-skate uncle. If you want to laugh out loud, then I suggest you check out the Jamie Foxx show. Season 1 is out on DVD now."
