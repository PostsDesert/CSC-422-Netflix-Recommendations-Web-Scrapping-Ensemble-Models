        "reviewBody": "'Guddi' is another good entertainment by the vintage Mukherjee. This is the story of Kusum, a bubbly and vivacious girl who is a great film buff and whose biggest love is Dharmendra, the top film star of that time. Her uncle, Mr. Gupta, wants her to get married to a guy named Navin, and she honestly tells Navin of her real/impossible love. Her uncle decides to give her an opportunity to meet her idol, and with the help of the star himself, gets permission to visit the sets daily in order for Kusum to see what film-making is all about.\n\nThe film intelligently shows how Kusum's enthusiasm is gradually fading with every day as she gets to know more of this world. Mukherjee gives us a great glimpse into the world of cinema, and we learn a lot about it, as does Kusum. She learns that much of the action is fake, that actors are not what they are perceived to be on-screen, that they are simple people who often make mistakes, and through the character of Dharmendra, she witnesses their feelings, fears and regrets. This leads to both a great deal of disappointment and at the same time some appreciation towards the star, but she simply realises he is not what she really thought him to be.\n\nThe film is done realistically, with simple writing and normal situations. The acting is very natural. Utpal Dutt is funny and likable with his comic sense. Samit Bhanja is absolutely fantastic as Navin. Dharmendra surprisingly does not have that big a role, yet he does full justice to it. But 'Guddi' is Jaya's film all the way. Her Kusum \"Guddi\" is a character many would find very easy to relate to, because not once have we ourselves been in love with different artists. I myself remember falling in love with several actresses after watching certain films. The viewer may sympathise and identify with her gradual growth, and that's purely because of her natural acting and simplicity. All in all, 'Guddi' is a worthy film. I wouldn't say it's particularly great, but it's entertaining, well-made and easily relatable.",
