Racer X, Spridal his pet Chim-Chim and Pops Racer all add up to an exciting half hour. The show centers around Speed Racer and his quest to be the fastest racer in the world, with his high tech personalized Mach 5, he saves the world from evil terrorists while still finding time to race in the circuit and see his girlfriend Trixie. Old Japanese animation at its best."
