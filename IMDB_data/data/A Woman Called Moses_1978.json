It's a travesty Tyson wasn't nominated for an Emmy or Golden Globe award for her performance (at least I can't find that information anywhere). I highly recommend this film over the 2018 theatrical film HARRIET. While that film is good, this one is grittier and more realistic. Cynthia Erivo gives an amazing performance (Oscar nominated) in that film as well. Check this one out first though.",
