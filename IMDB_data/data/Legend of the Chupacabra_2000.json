I bought it at the reasonable price of seven bucks and went home to watch it. I love Troma movies... all of them from Surf Nazis Must Die to there most famous character the Toxic Avenger. But Legend of the Chupacabra was just plain borring. I was very dissapointed in this movie. I loved that suit the creature was wearing (there's a extra on the dvd showing how he gets into it... the dvd might be worth getting to watch. I thought it was funny). I thought the old mexician lady was funny, that was about it."
