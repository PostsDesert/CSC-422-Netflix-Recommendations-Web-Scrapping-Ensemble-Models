        "reviewBody": "The first film in a great series of samurai films. Veteran Japanese actor Tomisaburo Wakayama, brother of Shintaro Katsu (Zatoichi), stars as the ultra-stoic hero Ogami Itto, who, along with his infant son Daigoro and a babycart with hidden spears and guns, wages a one-man war against the evil Yagyu clan who killed his wife and framed him for disloyalty to the Shogunate. A very well-made series of action films, some reasonably inventive direction, editing, and photography, a good soundtrack too. The action scenes are especially well-done, from the one-on-one sword duels to the Wild Bunch-style Ogami Itto vs. Everybody battles at the end of each film. A must-see for anyone who enjoys Spaghetti Westerns or martial-arts films.",
