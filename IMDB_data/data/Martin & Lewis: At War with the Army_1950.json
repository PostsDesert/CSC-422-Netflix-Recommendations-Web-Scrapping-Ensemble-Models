        "reviewBody": "\"Martin\" is one of the best television shows of all time. It is by far the funniest black sitcom ever created, far surpassing breakthrough shows like \"The Jeffersons\" and \"Good Times\". The 70's sitcom \"What's Happening!!\" is the only other show that comes close. When you watch a comedy show, it is common to smile, chuckle or laugh - but when you watch \"Martin\", particularly the first two to three seasons, you find yourself laughing so hard it hurts. This is a laugh out loud and stomp your feet show thanks to a brilliant comic talent - Martin Lawrence. Many people who I have talked to about this show have said they \"don't get it\" and that the rapid fire urban cultural references fly over their heads. I say, exactly. This show is clever and sharp and if you actually laugh at crap like \"Will & Grace\", you won't \"get\" this show either. Unlike every other pale, bland humored show out there, \"Martin\" is full flavored, knock you on your ass funny. Do not miss the chance to see it every time its rerun, you'll be witnessing t.v. sitcom history."
