        "reviewBody": "Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller were a terrific songwriting team who wrote classic hits for several well-known singers for decades. The cast is the original who performed in 1995. They reunited to perform for a taped event. The songs are familiar and done well. The cast do a terrific job. If I have one complaint is that there is nothing to connect one song to each other. If you're a fan of the musical, this will be a dream come true to those who enjoyed the show live on stage. The cast and crew don't miss a beat with the music and dancing. It's an enjoyable light-hearted show overall.",
