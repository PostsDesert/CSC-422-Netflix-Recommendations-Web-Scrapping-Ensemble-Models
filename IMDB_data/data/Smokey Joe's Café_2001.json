        "reviewBody": "I saw this show live at a regional theatre in my home state of Massachusetts and fell immediately in love with it. It was a strange and pleasant coincidence that this taped version of the show's final Broadway performance was being broadcast on HBO that night. All in all, I have to say it was better live. Deb Lyons (who was in the regional production) and DeLee Lively shine as the best performers in the whole show. With Lyons' power house voice and Lively's constant movement, one would think this were the first performance. Other good good performers are Adrian Bailey, Brenda Braxton and Frederick B. Owens for their vocal talents (and Braxton in particular for her acting). Ken Ard's voice is good, but he gives off such an annoying air of egotism that got under my skin. Victor Trent Cook is a wonderful actor, but not as good a singer. B.J. Crosby tries too hard to belt her songs and too often ends up screaming incoherently. The worst performer in the whole thing is Matt Bogart. He cannot sing at all, faking his way through every song. The only things he has going for him are his looks. Regardless of all the bad, I taped this special. The show is very well put together. Smokey Joe's Cafe is quite possibly the greatest musical revue of all time.",
