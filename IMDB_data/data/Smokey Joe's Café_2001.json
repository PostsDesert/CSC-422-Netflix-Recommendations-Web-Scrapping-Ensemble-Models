        "reviewBody": "I saw this in NYC right after it opened, a touring production a few years back and more recently, saw it in an intimate dinner theater cafe setting and all productions were great. This is the type of show that grows on you. You never get tired of hearing the songs if the production is good. The HBO production of the last show at the Virginia Theater was well produced and I enjoyed it very much. Deb Lyons was the only non-original cast member and I though she had the best voice. Her rendition of \"Don't\" with Ken Ard was a show stopper. Brenda Braxton was spot on as the sultry black woman as was DeLee Lively as the blonde chick. Does she ever stop moving? The others were adequate with the exception af Matt Bogart as the token white guy. I guess it was no coincidence that he had the fewest solos. Kind of reminds me of a play on the \"Chorus Line\" tune, Looks 10, Voice 2."
