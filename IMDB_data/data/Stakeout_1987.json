        "reviewBody": "\"Buddy Cop\" movies were all the rage in the 80s, and 'Stakeout' is filled to bursting with the genre's clichés. But the fresh titular premise and charming performances by, and great chemistry between, stars Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez help to lift it above the fay and make it feel fresh. Oh, and then there's Madeline Stowe. My God, Madeline Stowe. She is just... wow. But, she also gives a really nice performance here, and she and Dreyfuss make for a strangely good screen couple.\n\n'Stakeout' is a breezy, fun and subtly clever action/comedy (emphasis on the \"comedy\"). It's not groundbreaking, but it is solid entertainment for a lazy Sunday afternoon.",
