        "reviewBody": "Those 3 dvds collection of princess stories offers nice packaging but nothing valuable inside. It is always just 2 cartoons (Ariel & Jasmine), very cheap animated stories and compilation music videos. \n\nSo, beware of your deception and don't be fooled ! If you think that Disney sell for kids and respect them with all the \"Disney DVD\", \"Pure Digital Magic\", and alluring titles as \"Friendship\", \"A gift from the heart\" and \"The inside beauty\", well, forget all this! It is only commercial plots to get you money !\n\nSo what's left : As a big fan of Jasmine, it is cool to discover the Aladdin cartoons. As it took me time to get the titles on the net, here they are: Volume I: Bad Moon Rising (S1. #2): a spoiled kid king: 10/10 Volume II: Love at 1st Sprite (S1. #57): irritating sub gremlins: 4/10 Volume III: Eye of the Beholder (S2. #13): a love test for Jasmine & Aladdin (7/10)\n\nIt was indeed a very good way for American audience or international ones (with the worldwide appeal of Disney) to get in touch with Arabic culture: in how many cartoons can you see African tribes today?\n\nSo, Disney should be less hypocrite and do as everyone, release the Aladdin (or Little mermaid) season cartoons in DVD and get out what they pretend to offer!",
