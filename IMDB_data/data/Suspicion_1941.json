She starts to believe that husband Cary Grant may be too good to be true. It appears that he may be a heartless murderer who may be targeting her as his next victim. Hitchcock, the undisputed master of suspense, does not let the audience off easy here. The film's twists and turns will keep you glued until the stunning final act. Not without flaws, but still another winner from Hitchcock. 4.5 out of 5 stars."
