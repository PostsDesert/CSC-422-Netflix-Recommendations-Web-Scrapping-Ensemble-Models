Aidan Quinn was fantastic, it was nice to see him a role that was very original. After we watched the movie we went in search of the soundtrack. The music and lyrics were very haunting, and gave a good look into how life was like for this particular group of people.\n\nIf you are looking for a movie that is beautiful, thoughtful, endearing, and is filled with original and stirring music this is a must see for you! Even my boyfriend liked it, and he strays from watching many of these artsy films!"
