        "reviewBody": "I saw this movie shortly after it first came out - when I was a kid. The scene that sticks with me to this day is when the scoops come to break up the riot. The cop says, \"The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted. The scoops are on the way.\" Then the front-end loader trucks come and scoop the people up like so much garbage. The fact that 2022 looks like 1973 is entirely plausible because society has gone retrograde. Charlton Heston's performance is beautifully nuanced and believable. Edward G. Robinson is unforgettable as Sol. References to this movie pop up in shows like \"The Simpsons\" and \"Millennium\" for the simple reason that it is a visionary look at the future with real heart - a true classic."
