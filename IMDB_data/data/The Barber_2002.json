The thing i liked most were the Quirky characters, there was some great acting in this movie from start to finish.\n\nYou are left wondering whether or not The Barber was really the killer during the course of the movie. You will find out near the end of the film, and i won't ruin it by mentioning if it was or wasn't him.\n\nRent the movie, you just may like it also...if nothing else, it is a CUT above the rest!"
