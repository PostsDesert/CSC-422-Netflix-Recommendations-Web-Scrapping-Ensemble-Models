I cannot lay the blame on them however, since the dialog they were given to execute seemed to have been written by a 10-year old. Is there so little first hand experience with blacks from the urban areas that director thought they spoke completely in monosyllables or clich√©s? \n\nWere the writers on strike during the making of this film? And who dreamed up this plot line? An electronic genius steals cars for a living. With his talent, why cars? There is no adequate motivation given to our 'silent' hero's actions.\n\nIt's obvious that this single movie killed both J. King's and Portia Cue's acting careers.",
