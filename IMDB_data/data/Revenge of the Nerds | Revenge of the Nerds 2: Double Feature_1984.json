We had just finished watching the phenomenal Ghostbusters and having this follow it was a pleasant surprise indeed. \n\nIt's pretty much a 'Rocky'-type plot. The underdogs fighting back to win it BUT it's how these types go about it that makes this movie so charming!\n\nBeing an 80's film, political correctness was not considered...at all!\n\n Thank-god! \n\nI hunted this movie down after trying several video stores to no avail and finally after popping it in and showing it to family and friends (some of whom were too young to have seen it or not born at all during this film's release!) enjoyed it thoroughly! It's nearly timeless!!! Watching Bernie Casey listening to 'Swing Low Sweet Chariot' had us all on the floor!!! We're black and we weren't offended in the least! Why should we? It's a harmless comedy with good ol' dirty humour for all.\n\nPorky's and Animal House are the only ones of this era that could be considered part of the holy Teen-age comedy trilogy! All the rest, and there were a few, just don't measure up.\n\nMy folks and I enjoyed this film almost 20 years ago in that old drive-in (which has long-been shut-down now), while leaving my dad cited that it was a rare event to watch two great comedies back-to-back like that...two great nostalgic classics...very rare indeed!"
