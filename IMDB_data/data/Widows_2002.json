        "reviewBody": "\"Widows\" is a teleflick which sticks Ruehl out front as one of four women widowed when someone \"offs\" their \"significant others\" during a heist. What follows is a long, tedious black comedy about the motley gaggle of females who set out to get revenge and recompense. Perhaps the biggest problem with this 3 hour miniseries is not what's there but what's missing. There's no significant love or romance or sex; comedy or gags or laughs; heart or gut wrenching drama; etc. There is some action but the bulk of the flick is just scheming upon scheming, busy work, and developing characters who aren't very interesting and who engender little empathy. Too long, too tedious, too little, too late. Recommended as an exercise in conquering ADD. (C)\n\nNote - This miniseries is anywhere from 168 to 273 minutes depending on where you get the info. The DVD sleeve showed 168 minutes which is probably the DVD's run time though it seemed more like 273 minutes.",
