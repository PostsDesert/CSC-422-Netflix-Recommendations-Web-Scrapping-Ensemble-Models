What's worse is that I had to cancel (the reason escapes me), but I bought the DVD a couple of years later.\n\nI don't have too much else to say other than it's a concert I wish I had gone to, and I'm glad I have the DVD of that same concert in my collection. Great music from a great group of musicians who actually perform on stage.\n\nCheck out a copy, plug in your earphones and sit back and enjoy."
