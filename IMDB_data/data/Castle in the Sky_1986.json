        "reviewBody": "This is a really interesting movie that bears some resemblance to another great Miyazaki film, KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE. Like KIKI, the action takes place on some Earth-like world--so much like Earth but different because it had the weirdest flying machines and sky pirates! It was also rather reminiscent of the Dreamcast video game, The Skies of Arcadia. and the X-Box's Crimson Skies. Strange but also pretty intriguing--that's for sure. For fans of airplanes and vintage aviation, this is an especially appealing film.\n\nWell, in this world of sky pirates and bizarre flying machines comes the rumor of a floating castle in the sky. And, of course, our intrepid heroes are bent on finding it and unlocking its secrets.\n\nThe film has amazing animation, a unique style and is very engaging. While kids will enjoy it immensely, unlike some Miyazaki films, I really think that in some cases adults might like this even more than kids. Good stuff well worth a look.",
