The acting was horrid and the \"story\" looks like it was thrown together over lunch but, the way the movie poked fun at the horror genre is something rarely seen. Most slasher flicks are funny but, that's cause they try to make a good movie. After seeing the whole set, they made this movie clearly to laugh at and have a good time watching it.\n\nI did enjoy Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers and would recommend it to friends. Like others have said, it's mindless gory fun. Hats off to the creators of SC 2 & 3 for making a funny/cheesy flick and letting us have a good time watching it."
