        "reviewBody": "Tail Lights Fade\" presents itself as Canada's answer to the \"Cannonball\" films. With a little better pacing it could have been one. Unfortunately it is simply too slowly paced. After watching for awhile with nothing happening but talk, one tends to get bored. Many of the actors seemed bored as well. The only person who really shows some life is a very tattoo covered Elizabeth Berkley. She actually seems to be enjoying herself.\n\nThe film is not without merit however. There are enough interesting scenes to justify watching. The ending segment is particularly well presented. I'd say watch it but don't expect the moon."
