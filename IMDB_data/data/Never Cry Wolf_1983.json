Mowat falsified what the natives he worked with were saying. It turns out Mowat had never bothered to learn Inuit language. Mowat also claimed to be out doing fieldwork when in fact he had not been in the field. Just take a look at Wikipedia article on this fraudster in the \"controversies\" section. he even lied about his combat service."
