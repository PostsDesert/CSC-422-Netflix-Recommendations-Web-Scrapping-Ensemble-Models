        "reviewBody": "Why this film got torn apart by critics when it was released baffles me. It is a solid film with great performances all around. There is drama, tension and all in all very crisp direction.\n\nBrando proves again why he is simple the best ever, he is absolutely brilliant. The scenes that he has with Angie Dickinson and then his legendary beating up scene are just worth the price a ticket. He over shadows everyone. His character is the moral fiber of the town and how he stands up to the bigoted town and then walk away from it is the crux of the story. Some great lines are uttered by him are hilarious and totally steal the scene from the rest of the cast.\n\nA good film and from the period in the 60s when all the so called movie critics said he (Brando) anything great.\n\nwell they are wrong as proved by - the chase, reflections in a golden eye, burn, one eyed jacks, mutiny on the bounty.\n\nway to go Brando and Arthur Penn.",
