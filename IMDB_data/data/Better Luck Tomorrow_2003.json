        "reviewBody": "Its all well and good that this movie is attempting to break down stereotypes (perhaps by replacing them with other stereotypes), but that doesn't necessarily make for a good movie.\n\nYou could have changed a few names, used some different actors, and this would be an ordinary, bland movie about \"rich youth gone bad\". It has been done better.\n\nI liked the characters, but the story just wasn't developed enough and they never really get into motivations. They tried to throw in a few lines of \"what is the meaning of life\", but that does *not* connect various scenes into an actual telling story and it does *not* a plot make.\n\nToo many loose ends are left at the end of this movie. If they want to pretend they \"meant to do that\", well, I just don't believe 'em. You never really get into most of the characters deep enough to explain why you had to watch them run around for the previous 2 hours.\n\n\"Amongst Friends\" was the same movie done several years back, but it was just better written."
