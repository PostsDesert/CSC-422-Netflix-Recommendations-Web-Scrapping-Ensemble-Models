Folks, there are no geysers deep in the Earth like that. They thought it looked neat and in typical Hollywood style they threw it in. And then there is that well that spewed lava. He dropped a stone and I heard a splash. Steam would have erupted out of that well before a blast of lava could, if ever.\n\nAnd the acting was pretty bad as well. Micheal Dorn has sunk to a new low in jobs.\n\nWhat a dog of a movie. I bet the vote goes no higher than a 3.5\n\nIt didn't look like SciFi Channel spent too much other than to have pretty boy Perry as an attempt to draw.",
