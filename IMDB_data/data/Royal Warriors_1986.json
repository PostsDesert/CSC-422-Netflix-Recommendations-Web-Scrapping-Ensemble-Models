        "reviewBody": "Michelle Yip (Michelle Yeoh) of the Hong Kong police is a mild-mannered Kung Fu expert; Michael Wong from air security is happy-go-lucky, stuck on himself, constantly talking, and smitten by her; Yamamoto (Hiroyuki Sanada)is quiet, hard-boiled, leaving the Tokyo police to spend time with his wife and daughter. They form an alliance when they foil a hijacking on a plane flying a mob prisoner from Tokyo to Hong Kong. The mobster and his would-be rescuer die; this sets off two avengers who were their blood brothers. Our three cops become the targets.\n\nMichelle Yeoh and Hiroyuki Sanada star in this hard-hitting cop action film which has non stop action, and of the exhilarating kind. Frantic hand to hand combat, a high-speed chase, a car bomb, the destruction of a nightclub, a spectacular suicide, a fight in a plane, and a tense cliffhanger at the end, all executed with skill. The parts in between the mayhem is much lighter, which is due to Michael Wong who is smitten by Yeoh. It's pleasant, and a break from the mayhem. But ultimately it's the action set pieces and Yeoh's and Sanada's high kicking attitude that makes this a recommended watch for martial arts fans.",
