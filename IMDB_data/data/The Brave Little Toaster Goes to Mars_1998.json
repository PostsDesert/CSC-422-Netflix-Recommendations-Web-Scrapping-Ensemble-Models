        "reviewBody": "Even though I must confess that the premise for the movie still makes my head hurt. It just seemed mind-boggling to have a bunch of household appliances zooming off on a popcorn-powered spaceship made from a fan and a laundry basket.\n\nI can't say more than that simply to avoid spoilers, but since the original movie had an interestingly layered storyline where the plot seemed strangely plausible despite the absurdity of living appliances, this was just too bizarre to awaken the same feelings in me. The songs here are also pretty forgettable, but not awful.\n\nBut with all that said, I actually found some satisfaction in the new character of Tinselina who had a decently touching character arc being a Christmas ornament never been used on a Christmas tree. And despite the out of this world premise that's what the movie is about, having a purpose and commiting to it instead of denying oneself.",
