I think \"La répetition\" is one of the best films that have ever been made on the passion of a woman to another one. The interesting point about that is the passion has not got counter-love or passion from the desired woman.\n\nA story of women, from a woman which reflects perfectly, the ununderstandable relation of passion, hate and rivalry between two friends."
