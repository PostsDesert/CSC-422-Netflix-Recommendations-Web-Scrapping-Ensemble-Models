The doc is full of humor, insight, and love, and is charged with real emotion, thanks to the incredible Papa Wexler, the central character.\n\nI expected a typical Hollywood tribute film, and it is that to some extent. But it rapidly becomes so much more. Surprisingly, the filmmaker Mark Wexler makes his localized Hollywood experience universally applicable to all sons and all fathers. What could have been a dismissable fluff piece is transformed into a rich analysis of the dynamics of fathers and sons. Haskell should be proud; he's obviously taught his son well. I thank both father and son for this film.",
