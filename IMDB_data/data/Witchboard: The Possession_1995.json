No, it's not scary and the special effects are lame, but I don't know, this film still delivers in some fashion. It's about a couple that move into an apartment and the husband soon connects with their land lord and the land lord introduces the husband into the ouija board. From there, the land lord gives Brian, the husband, a ring jumps off of his balcony, just before doing so he states \"see ya in the funny papers kid.\" Brian then pursues use of the ouija board and from there everything seemingly falls apart with his marriage life. \n\nNot a real high body count and like I said before, the special effects aren't ones to get excited about. I kind of liked the script and acting between the husband and wife. \n\nNow if you have not seen any of the rest of the Witchboard films, then I recommend that you start with the original, which is by far the best of the series. 5/10"
