        "reviewBody": "Mixing the plots of Godfather with Casino, Goodfellas etc this follows the story of Tony Cortino who returns home as a war hero who is forced into the leadership of the Mafia following the attempted assassination of his father.\n\nWhat does the plot matter - it is broadly a copy of the first two Godfathers but ropes in plenty of spoofs of gangster movies as well as others (eg Forrest Gump), however it's main success (if it has one) is that it reminds you how good those films are. When I finished watching this I wanted to watch all the real films to wash this nasty thing out of my mind.\n\nThe spoof scenes are lazy and not inspired at all - they are really easy and obvious, totally lacking any intelligence or effort. I actually enjoy spoofs - Blazing Saddles, Airplane, Naked Gun - I enjoy them all, so it's not like I feel they're beneath me or anything. However the jokes here are stupid, I actually chuckled twice in 90 minutes (not laughed but chuckled), and both of these were at stupid jokes.\n\nThe cast are OK but deserve better - when I see Vincent Pastore in this after being so good in Sopranos it makes me sad. Fair enough, Jay Mohr probably doesn't deserve any better but the rest do. The saddest sight is Bridges - so funny in Airplane and Hotshots, but here his clowning is rubbish. What makes it worse is that before the end credits the film is dedicated to his memory! Surely a more fitting tribute would have been to reshoot all his scenes and prevent this from being one of the last things he did.\n\nOverall this is terrible - I'm a fan of spoofs and this barely made me laugh once or twice. This only success in reminding you how good the original films were. A mess!"
