        "reviewBody": "No doubt it's one of the best films of our childhood. Then, many of us didn't know who Kamal Haasan was. While growing we get to know more and more about this legend. This is the official remake of Tamil film Avvai Shanmughi, Kamal Haasan was also there in the lead role. The Hindi remake was to be directed by Shantanu Sheorey, but it's good that Kamal took over as director and we get to introduce with the Director Kamal Haasan.\n\nMany may say that this type of concept will not work nowadays. But, without any doubt I can say that this film would've been same hit what it was back then because of its brilliant portrayal and writing. Lyrics by Gulzar and music of Vishal Bhardwaj were easily lovable and now nostalgic. Loved the entire cast specially Om Puri, Paresh Rawal and little Fatima. Really miss this type of comedies nowadays.\n\nAvailable on YouTube.\n\nÂ© MandalBros.",
