As if someone reading bad poetry on the soundtrack and lots of flashy cutting would make up for the fact this is simply a lot of pictures of pretty boys naked, in various states of dress, and sometimes masturbating, but always alone. The boys are very pretty to look at, but that does not make up for the fact that this is nothing more than an attempt to make artsy-fartsy soft-core gay porn flick. Perhaps if the director had used real people instead of gay models this would have been something different. Still, the pseudo-poetry and the actor reading it are pretty awful. The acting and dancing in the non-modeling scenes are equally pathetic.\n\nDecodings, with which it is paired on video, is a similar bit of nonsense without the pretty boys, just a lot of senseless, non-connected stock footage.",
