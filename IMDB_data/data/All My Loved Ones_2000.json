The focus of the story is the boy's warm large family, and their failure to escape while it was possible to do so. Despite the superficial similarity of the theme to \"Schindler's List\", this film is in a sense the direct opposite--instead describing the unbelievable but true acts of an incredible man (Oskar Schindler), it tells the story of very ordinary people, some of whom act decently and humanly, and others don't. It is unreasonable to ask why weren't there more Oskar Schindlers; one inevitably wonders why weren't there more Nicholas Wintons.",
