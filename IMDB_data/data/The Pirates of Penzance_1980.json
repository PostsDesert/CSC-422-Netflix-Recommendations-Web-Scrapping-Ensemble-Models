        "reviewBody": "...is that I can't take a time machine back so that I can be there for this performance. The tape is technically sub-par, but it's not that bad. There's a bit of a machine hum for a few minutes and there's a little gargliness in part of the finale. But it's absolutely worth it. I'm a big fan of the film version, but it's like the difference between a blow-up doll and a live person. Patricia Routledge gives a great performance. And in the live show, you realize that Rex Smith has a HUGE voice. This performance is so lively, and the audience is having such a great time. I rented it and then promptly went to Amazon and bought it.",
