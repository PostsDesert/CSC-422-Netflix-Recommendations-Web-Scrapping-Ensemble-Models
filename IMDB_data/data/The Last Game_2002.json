        "reviewBody": "Simply put- I am not a football fan and I was forced to watch this by my brother who is a jock and loves anything relating to sports.\n\nSure, this is a movie about football- but if focuses on a father and son and the mother and wife in the middle.\n\nThe father and son must play each other... I won't go into the plot anymore, but the film has a narrative arc that William Goldman couldn't get right without looking cliched.\n\nI hope this film finds an audience somewhere, because it's better than HOOP DREAMS, and maybe it will find an audience, because USA TODAY just said it was the \"HOOP DREAMS of football\" and gave it 4 stars (Mike Clark)... all in all, one of the biggest surprises of my movie watching life- I expected nothing (well, I expected to be bored by macho grunts) and I got one of the most inspirational, life affirming, positive films I have ever seen.\n\nAnd the ending? Absolutely insanely great.\n\nPlease see it and tell a friend and maybe in 10 years this will show up on the mainstream radar...\n\nGod willing...",
