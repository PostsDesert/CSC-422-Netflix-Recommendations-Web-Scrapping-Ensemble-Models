        "reviewBody": "Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx) is a career petty criminal who got caught stealing prawns. U.S. Treasury investigator Edgar Clenteen (David Morse) is working on a case of stolen $42M gold. John Jaster (Robert Pastorelli) double crossed his partner Bristol (Doug Hutchison) and hid the gold. The investigation finds Jaster's fingerprint and it turns out that he's in Rikers for DWI. Before he dies, the sick Jaster tells Alvin to tell his wife that \"There's no place like home.\" and about the Brooklyn zoo. The technically advanced Bristol is using his skills to follow Clenteen in his investigation. The amoral Clenteen secretly plants a tracker/bug in Alvin's jaw, and let a rumor out that he knows where the gold is. They allow Alvin to walk and Clenteen hopes to catch Bristol when he comes after Alvin.\n\nJamie Foxx is trying so hard to be the smart-mouthed fun guy, and the movie is trying to be a high-energy thriller. Neither one reach their goal. It's just too outlandish. There's too much ridiculous stuff going on. Director Antoine Fuqua is trying hide a mediocre comedy thriller with a lot of attitude. It just tires out the movie. Of the three lead characters, I like none of them. The constant yapping from Foxx is not fun, and Mike Epps is not a good partner for him. They're almost the same character. The duo needs a straight guy. And the action is second rate anyways.",
