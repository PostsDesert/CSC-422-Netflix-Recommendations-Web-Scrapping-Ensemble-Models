Others introduce concepts in art and music, or general skills, like determining the proper order in which to do things in a step by step process. Still others emphasize behavioral issues: responsibly caring for pets, dealing with fears, frustration, and frustrating individuals, to name a few.\n\nSteve, the sole live action individual in the show, is a warm, non-threatening individual who manages to project a gentle enthusiasm without sounding sappy and saccharine. I was sorry to read that Steve Burns intends to leave the show, but can understand it for myself. There must be some point where one would want to throttle someone if forced to sing \"We just got a letter!\" one more time."
