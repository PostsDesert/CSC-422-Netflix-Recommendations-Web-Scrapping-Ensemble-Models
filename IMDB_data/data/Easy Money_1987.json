And I'm not saying that because it has very little action; Yeoh's 1996 drama \"The Stunt Woman\" also has very little action, but it is an interesting film nonetheless - this one isn't. It is disjointed, pointless, and not as smart as it thinks it is (George Lam decides that Michelle is the mastermind behind a robbery based on a hunch and the viewing of heist movies). If you are a Yeoh fan, you might want to check this out for completion's sake, since it is her least-known film (and it's easy to see why). (*1/2)",
