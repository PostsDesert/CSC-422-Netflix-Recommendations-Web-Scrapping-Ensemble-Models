It's German, too...but it ain't good.\n\n\"Ein Toter hing im Netz\" (or \"The Horrors of Spider Island\" as I know it) is about horrors, all right: the horrors of male chauvinism run rampant. \n\n Seems Gary, or \"That Lucky SOB\", is stranded on a desert island after a plane crash with loads of gorgeous babes who are headed to Singapore. But not just any babes, mind you. These are babes that wear nicely tattered clothes, murmur and faint a lot, shed their extra clothes and dance and writhe a lot. Can you tell which part of this movie held my interest the most?\n\nOh yeah - Gary gets bitten by a spider (that looks more like the grumpy neighbor of a cartoon character) and turns into a spider monster.... Well, more accurately, he turns into a shirtless guy with a hairy face and three teeth, and almost INSTANTLY after being bitten. \n\nI really can't get much into the plot, as the plot is pretty shallow. Besides, the best exposure to this flick is on MST3K with Mike and the Robots, as you can well imagine. \n\nFAVORITE MOMENT - when a guy is caressing one of the dancers then another woman stands seductively over them as one of the robots grunts, \"Hey, how 'bout tryin' a she-male, buddy?\" And if you ever want to see a robot faint, show them this movie.\n\nThree stars, amazingly, for this movie, for the babes. Ten stars for the MST3K version, as if there was a doubt. \n\nAnd Babs, if you're reading this...marry me.",
