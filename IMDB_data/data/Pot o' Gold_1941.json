I only wish that the DVD master had cleaned up the sound more and brought out better frequency response.\n\nJimmy Stewart was his usual charming self. Its hard to hate a movie with Jimmy in it. Even better, Jimmy actually sang and did quite well with the song. The first half of the movie had me laughing out loud!"
