The characters are really funny, although sometimes they can get a little out of hand and annoying. I enjoyed the first season quite thoroughly. The next season disappoints in a way, though. Those three Dark Axis 'honchos', Zapper Zaku, Grappler Gouf, and Destroyer Dom? They're nothing but comic relief now! It wasn't like before where they actually posed a threat or actually did anything useful. Now they always get stuck somewhere with all of their Zaku Soldiers... Pitiful, really. My only hope is that they are returned to their former glorified funny villain status, instead of their current pathetic comic relief state."
