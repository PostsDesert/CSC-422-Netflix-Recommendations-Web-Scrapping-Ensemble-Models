        "reviewBody": "This sitcom was a launching pad for Tracey Ullman, even Ruby Wax, Jennifer Saunders, and Dawn French in the cast as four unlikely roommates in a Chelsea flat with Lady Carlton (played by the wonderful Joan Greenwood). The series is mindless fun to watch and even thirty years later. Tracey Ullman has always been one of my favorite comics, a British Lucille Ball. She and the executive producer (her husband Allan McKeown) would move to America and produce her show. Tracey is still talented and funny even here. Ruby Wax OBE plays Shelly Dupont annoyingly but lovable too. She met her husband, Ed Bye (director) on the series. Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French's professional comedic partnership is first displayed here. French plays Amanda as a left wing feminist and funny. Saunders plays a moody roommate. Each roommate has a character developed to show their strengths. This series would not be one of British comedy's best but watchable and lovable all as well. You can't help but enjoy it.",
