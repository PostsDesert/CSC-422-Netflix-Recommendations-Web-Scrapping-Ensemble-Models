I haven't seen the original double dare, but people say it was really good so i'm going to have to watch it sometime. I was pretty young when the show came out, six, and I didn't know about it so i never watched it. But when I was 10 I saw it and I loved. I kept watching more of what nick gas gave me to watch like, get the picture, figure it out, GUTS, etc. and they are all pretty good shows. But I love double dare 2000. I also like it that they have families. Jason is a very good host. Though I wish I would've been older when these shows came out because I would really like to be an audience member. I'm 13 now and I never get bored with these shows:) overall- 10/10",
