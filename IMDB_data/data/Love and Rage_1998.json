        "reviewBody": "Period piece. Daniel craig, several years before he did casino royale. Greta scacchi. This one runs like a jane austen, but the book was actually by james carney. Female landowner agnes macdonnell hires lynchehaun to manage the estate on an island off ireland. From their very first meeting, things are a little tense and brusk between them; lynchehaun resents taking orders from a woman, and agnes is determined to keep him in his place. Or is it more than that? They begin an affair. Lots of talk of ministers and sermons. When lynchehaun gets violent and abusive, agnes wants out. But lynchehaun isn't ready to go away. Then things go from bad to worse. A rather rushed ending, in the last ten minutes. The story was basically solid, but it feels like most of the last reel ended up on the editing floor. Directed by cathal black. It's entertaining.",
