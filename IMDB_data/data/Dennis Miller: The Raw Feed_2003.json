Drawing on his experience as the 10-year host of his Emmy-winning HBO show \"Dennis Miller Live\" and his frequent appearances on political and talk shows, Miller fashions an eloquent, insightful and dangerously edgy monologue as hilarious as it is brilliant. Miller's humor is very intelligent, but he speaks from a very common-man perspective, and it's about time someone thew back what the liberals were dishing out. Soon to be launching a political talk show on CNBC later this month, Dennis Miller is sure to be a fixture for common sense political humor for years to come.",
