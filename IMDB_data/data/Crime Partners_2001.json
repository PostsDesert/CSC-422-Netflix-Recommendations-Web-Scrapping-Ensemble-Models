I was hurt because I paid for it before previewing it first If i can help anyone out there, this is my effort do NOT waste your time or money. I am sure Donald Goines thought this would be a proud moment in his literary career. But, unfortunately, this was turned into a injustice to his literary work. The acting was so bad that I could not stand to watch this movie without closing my eyes praying the next scene would be better. How can you put seasoned actors in a movie where the director must have been a new graduate.",
