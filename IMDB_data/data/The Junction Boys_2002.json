I can not imagine the real \"Junction Boys\" having any trouble with their real names having been used. I also have a minor complaint about the players hugging each other. They did not do that, not in 1954. They just didn't. Otherwise, it is an outstanding diversion. As near as I can tell, not a whole lot of\n\nother liberties have been taken with the truth. It is worth watching..."
