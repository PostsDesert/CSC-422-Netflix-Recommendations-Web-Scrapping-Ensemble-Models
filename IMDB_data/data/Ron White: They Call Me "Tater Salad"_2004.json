        "reviewBody": "Ron White: They Call Me Tater Salad shows Ron White at his best. This show will make you all though out the show. Ron White always smoke and drinks when he's on stage. Ron White: They Call Me Tater Salad is a must-see for any Ron White Fan and for people looking for a good laugh! Some of his jokes are dumb, but the other jokes are some of the best ever told. Personally, My favorite jokes are the one about Ron White getting throw out of a bar in New York City, The One about Sears, The one about having to paid a lot of money for a pair of sunglasses and the Big Screen TV, The Jokes about \"Coupins\" and more. This is a must-see for Comedy fans and for Ron White Fans. Ron White will make you laugh so hard that you'll start to cry because Ron White's so funny. So Enjoy, have fun and bring Your \"Coupins\"",
