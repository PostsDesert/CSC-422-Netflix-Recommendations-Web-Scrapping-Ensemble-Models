Half a dozen edgy suspects are rousted and interrogated, with each given the opportunity to voice their alibi.\n\nBernardo Bertolucci's stunning directorial debut at the age of 22 displays the work of a seasoned master that will reach peak fruition in the years ahead from The Conformist to the Last Emperor. Displaying some dazzling camera work and editing he presents a punks gallery of surly deadbeats along with a feral conscript in one audacious act of scene stealing, making all likely suspects. The list of suspects runs a little long, slowing the pace, with the denouement a touch of a disappointment in the face of all the razzle dazzle style leading up to the murderer's capture the film's thunder dominated by Bertolucci's precocious talent..",
