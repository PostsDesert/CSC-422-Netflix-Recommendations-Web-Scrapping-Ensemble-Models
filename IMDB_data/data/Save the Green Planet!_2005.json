        "reviewBody": "The set-up alone for Save the Green Planet demands your attention.\n\nWhen a drugged up, marginalized bee-keeper (Ha-kyun Shin) researches the background of a powerful industrialist (Yun-shik Baek), he can draw only one conclusion: the latter is an alien from Andromeda with designs on taking over the Earth on the next eclipse. And he does what any paranoid, stimulant-addled citizen might do -- kidnap the man, shackle him in his basement, and torture the truth out of him.\n\nFrom this wacky premise comes one of those rare films that successfully mixes dark comedy with true pathos. But the real excitement comes with the film-making, which offers cinematic parodies, inventive plotting, and some penetrating commentary on the evolution of humankind. If Charlie Kaufman were South Korean, this would be the kind of film he'd make.\n\nAlternative history fans will roll in the aisles with the film's wry treatment of UFOs, the death of the dinosaurs, alien abduction, and all sorts of science fiction clich√©s. Save the Green Planet is just plain fun -- scary fun, uncomfortable fun -- but you won't dare doze off for even an instant.",
