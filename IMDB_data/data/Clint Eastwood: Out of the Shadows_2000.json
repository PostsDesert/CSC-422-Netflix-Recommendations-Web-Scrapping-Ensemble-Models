        "reviewBody": "This isn't a biography of one of the big icons, never mind movie stars, of the past forty or so years, Clint Eastwood. But it is a perfect (if maybe just slightly short) take on his career as a whole, how he practically fell into acting, and how he has crafted the kind of niche most actors only wish they could attain. He is also shown as a consummate professional as a director, and a lover of jazz. It's really just what it appears to be, a retrospective, but it is one that goes to just that right adulatory rate. The many interviews talk of Clint's star presence, his ambiguity and quiet-side, and how he probably makes for the most lean-moviemaker ever (not in the physical sense necessarily, just in how his films go). I also really enjoyed seeing them go into depth on the films Bird and Unforgiven, as well as giving both sides to the Dirty Harry issue. And Eastwood himself speaks without any pretense, he just speaks his mind on the facts of his career and of the films, no BS (especially when talking of the good and bad of the Sergio Leone films, plus the influence of Don Siegel). Fans should seek it out if they can, either on DVD or on TV by chance. It only goes to, obviously, 2000, and two of his best films have been made since then (with more time to come for others perhaps).",
