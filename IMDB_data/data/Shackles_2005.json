        "reviewBody": "Wow! So many aspects of the writing - not to mention the acting and directing - rang true. \n\nNot that I've ever been to prison, but what struck me was that this is an intensely dramatic and gripping story, told with no \"sensationalism\". Yet, this film is more disturbing/real/hopeful - and sensational - than anything I've seen in this genre in a long time.\n\nThe main reason I wanted to see this film was the fact that D.L. Hughley was attempting a very scary thing: transitioning from comedic to dramatic actor. He did this quite brilliantly. He brought a depth to the role that would have been lacking in some of our better-known stars. Bravo to cast and production team!",
