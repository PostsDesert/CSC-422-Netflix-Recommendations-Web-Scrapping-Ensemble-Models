        "reviewBody": "Not rocket science, not thought provoking, not an immortal love story, just a fun romance and an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.\n\nThe tale revolves around a rich snob, Joanna Stayton, who hires a carpenter, Dean Proffitt, to do some work on her yacht, then refuses to pay him. She gets her comeuppance when she falls overboard and Dean fishes her out of the sea. Since she suffers from amnesia, the scoundrel is able to convince her that she is his wife, Annie, and mother to his brood of four rowdy boys.\n\nThe leading actors are great in their roles, with Kurt Russell portraying the carpenter, Dean, and the always amusing Goldie Hawn as Joanna / Annie. It is really Goldie's ditsy, golden comedic talents that pull this ridiculous tale off. There is also a wealthy, indifferent husband, who barely misses her, but he is a minor character.\n\nIn addition to the constant laughs, mainly at Joanna / Annie's expense, both characters learn a few lessons. Of course Joanna learns beware the dangers of self absorption and affluent disregard, unrepentantly cheating a skilled worker in your employ. For Dean, it's lessons of the 'oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive' school...some \"chemistry\" he wasn't expecting and some emotions from his four young hooligans he hadn't predicted.\n\nI'm ashamed to say I generally tune in to this mindless drivel whenever it happens to be on TV. A worthy example of its comedic genre, it just always seems perennially funny.",
