Some episodes you may find funnier than others just because of their subject matter. The behind the scenes portion of the disc raises the curtain on their techniques and time involved. How the get their subject matter is amazing. My favorite episode is \"Cats and Dogs.\" The character development is remarkable. You come to believe the characters are not human but, whatever life form you see before you and some fit their build quite well. If you enjoy creative television this is a great gift. You will see things going on the background to give scenes some depth and those may make you laugh out loud."
