Sadly, there weren't even any good sex scenes to make up for the awful acting, pathetic film production and horrible dubbing. The only redeeming thing to watch was Rio.\n\nI'm supposed to write 10 lines on this...but where do I begin. The actress who plays Emmanuelle is easily one of the worst actresses I've ever seen. I don't think there was a script...I think that the actors were supposed to improvise but the result were long scenes that go nowhere. Lots of scenes of naked women dancing around, and even some girl-on-girl action with Emmanuelle's horrible voice-over droning on and on about how the participants are \"taking their love to a new level of fulfillment.\"",
