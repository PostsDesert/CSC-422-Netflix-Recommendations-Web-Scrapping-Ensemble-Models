This is not what I had envisioned, when going to a concert. \"A movie\"? \"I didn't pay money for a movie, not tonight at least.\" The film which turned out to be Beyond The Gates Of Spldor, put me to tears. If you have ever had a tough time forgiving someone for an incident that happened in your past, please watch this movie.\n\nSteve Saint and Mincaye were there and walked on stage right after the film was shown, a standing ovation was given.\n\nFour years later I see the DVD for sale at a video store.\n\nI didn't even think twice about dropping $20.00 for this. It is a must have, and I am proud to own it."
