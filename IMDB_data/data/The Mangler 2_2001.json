OK, I admit that I missed the first 15 minutes. Thank God. But what does this movie have to do with the original? Why was it even rated R? Nothing happened! Talk about low budget! And how about a computer that taunts the token black guy before killing him. Nothing like a race conscious computer! Good grief. If this review stops at least one person from watching this movie, it would be worth it. I would give this movie 0/10 stars if possible.\n\nelcabio",
