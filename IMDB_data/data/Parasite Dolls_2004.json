        "reviewBody": "Nice One !\n\nTokyo, 2034: sophisticated robots called Boomers (and on first sight almost indistinguishable from us, humans) are among us. They are meant to assist us in the shores we despise, but more an more things go wrong and take a nasty turn. In 3 linked short stories we see a world where humanity is as much a thing of machines, as of \"biological\" units. Parasite Dolls is Blade Runner meets Strange Days in animation. Especially the capturing of emotions from the Boomers for pity sexual \"human\" games seemed like a very interesting idea, although this was not worked out in much detail. The rest of the ideas behind the film weren't very original, but the 3 stories were plotted very well and the characters were nicely developed. The score helped bringing a very real \"emotional\" feel to the film. The animations aren't spectacular compared to what you see in Ghost is the Shell for example, but they are adequate.\n\nIf you have a change to see this film, I can only recommend to actually go and see it: a classic Artificial Intelligence story (what's humanity, how about emotions, ...?) that's very well scripted and adequately animated.",
