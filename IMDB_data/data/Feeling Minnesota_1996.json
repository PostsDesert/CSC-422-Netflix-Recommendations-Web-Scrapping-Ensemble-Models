        "reviewBody": "With the possible exception of the minister who performs the wedding, every character in \"Feeling Minnesota\" is seriously flawed and not quite able to have a normal take on life. Keaunu Reeves, Vincent D'Onofrio, Dan Ackroyd, Cameron Diaz, Delroy Lindo, and even Tuesday Weld as the mother who dies during the wedding reception all play their roles to the hilt to create this hodge-hodge of ultimately quirky characters. There's no meaningful message here, except perhaps to remind us that we aren't doing so badly with our lives, if there really are characters like these out there!\n\nI bought this as a budget DVD, the picture is fine and has Doldy 5.1 surround sound. However, there isn't too much in the surround channels. The \"extras\" are spartan, so it is primarily the 95-minute film and nothing else. Critic Ebert has a very accurate review of \"Feeling Minnesota.\" I enjoyed it."
