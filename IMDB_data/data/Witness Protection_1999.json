        "reviewBody": "Witness Protection is a great film from HBO about a family that is forced to entered the witness protection program after their lives become endangered. However it is NOT what you might think, shootouts, narrow escapes, and a face off between mobster boss and betrayed loyal soldier, instead it is turned into a drama about a family disintegrating under the pressures of the situation they are in, and what an excellent drama it is ! The performances are all a knock out, in particular that of Mastroantonio, as the wife who stands by her man and whose life of luxury starts unraveling, this actress has a range that had never been exploited until now, her confrontation with her husband in the kitchen is to be remembered, she is so good that I am really upset about how many more roles she could play if only we had known. Sismore plays the mobster connected husband to perfection, his known ability to play sinister hoods is utilized to play a husband that keeps emotionally exploding as his life and family start to crumble. The actors playing their children are also in top form. The young child playing the daughter is amazing as a girl that is becoming traumatized on a daily basis by a stress filled environment. Finally there is Forrest Whitaker, his performance is fine for the role but again, Forrest is a monotone actor, he plays every character the same way, I never understood what the big hoo-ha-ha is about him, but in this role his demeanor is exactly what his role needs and it complements a movie that has absolutely no flaws. Kudos to the director for bringing out such performances from such unlikely actors. As someone here mentioned, I don't know why this film was not a theatrical release because it would have brought Oscar nominations for everyone involved, it is one of the best films of the year.",
