The erotic thrillerplot, the outragously great design and cinematography. Remember Flashdance or Cat People? Well, you got the idea! Well acted, actress Barbara Williams shines as seducted interior decorator , engaging love story with a great soundtrack and some very steamy sex scenes, it looked to me as if one of the scenes was actually hardcore! Must have been an unrated version! The story revolves around a pro burglar stealing the steamy diary of a bored nice sububan wife and then seduce her. This is not a masterpiece, just a nice erotic high-concept thriller well worth seeking out. 7/10",
