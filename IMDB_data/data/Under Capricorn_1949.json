        "reviewBody": "This is probably the most debated movie made by Alfred Hitchcock, especially in France where it was for a long time regarded as his best movie. As far as I'm concerned, I think that it's a very difficult movie where you don't recognize the signature of a director who was already regarded as the specialist of suspense by the time the movie was launched. Here, you don't find any murder and therefore, no killer, no investigation, no suspense. Without a doubt, it disconcerted the public and the movie was a spectacular commercial failure. \n\n\"Under Capricorn is an impersonal movie too. It means that Alfred Hitchcock made it but it could have been shot by any director. I think about Douglas Sirk.\n\nNow concerning the movie, well it's hard to be interested in the story because it's very complex and it's just laboriously solving in the second part of the movie. The movie also drags on and is terribly talkative. Even an outstanding performance from the actors (especially Joseph Cotten) doesn't manage to save the movie from boredom.\n\nA dull and boring movie which just goes to show that even a terrific director can make mistakes."
