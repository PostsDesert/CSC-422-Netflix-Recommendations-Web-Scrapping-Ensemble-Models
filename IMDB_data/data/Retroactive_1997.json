        "reviewBody": "Interesting premise. If you could relive a moment that went wrong, how could you \"fix\" it? It's not as simple as it may seem, and that is the point. Karen relives the moment that went wrong numerous times and every time she tries to \"fix\" it, it gets even worse! Very enjoyable. It is the imperfect ways that she tries to fix things that ring true. James Belushi is convincing as a red-neck creep who has neither class nor morals. \n\nThe fundamental premise (turning back time) is a real stretch. However, that is not a real drawback, since you only have time to ponder it in retrospect. Also, anyone who watches this will have their own ideas of how they would have \"fixed\" the problem. However even though it's not a perfect movie, it's still one that interestingly and entertainingly explores it's premise."
