        "reviewBody": "Found this ancient game and thought I'd have a have a little fun with it. I knew the graphics would be bad but actually they could be worse. My issue is with the controls and the game's response and lack of response. Immediately I wanted to play as night crawler. Luckily i was able to look up all the moves online. Problem is they dont always work and I tried out 2 controllers. Sometimes it seems you're an inch too far away from your opponent or too close or for seemingly no reason at all they just won't work even during the controlled academy training. Unfortunately rather than nothing happening you do some other attack that'll likely fail while putting you in range for their attack which may be unavoidable. Also at times you may accidentally teleport and for some reason you just can't then attack and have to \"run\" which is just to back away slowly hoping the controls come back before you start getting stomped. In addition to that at the start of a round there's no 321 countdown and it seems kinda random like they let either you or the opponent have a half second head start. It's just a frustrating game for someone who learns how its supposed to work and expects it to. But yeah it's 2 decades old.",
