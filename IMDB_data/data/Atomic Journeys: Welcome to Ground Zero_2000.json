There is some great scenes of nuke explosions! For many years our government (U.S. Government) kept this deadly secret from us. Nuclear blasts in our own backyard. It is very shocking that our own government would keep this kind of secret from us, but they have many more secrets then what they are telling us. Any way, this is a great movie. You need to see it. I would highly recommend this video to anyone. But, if you are going to check it out, watch the DVD version.",
