Sure, there are moments when it is a bit too saccharine, but it is still worth viewing. The cinematography is superb, and I think the music score is AMAZING. It is simple with a folk-song quality that I think fits with Saint Francis's teachings. I only wish there were a soundtrack available; I'd buy it in a heartbeat. I agree with the other commentator that there is nothing really \"new\" added to the story of Saint Francis; however, the story is a good story without something \"new\" added to it. I do wish that the film could have been a bit \"grittier\"; what I mean is, sometimes in the film, Saint Francis comes across as if he were so kind and gentle that he is floating or mindless. I wish the film could have shown the harsh realities that Saint Francis would have faced. Overall, the film is beautiful. Don't miss it.",
