It has a number of skills it teaches as well as musical melodies. She really likes this and everything that The Blues Clues Production puts out. Excellent film, if you want your children to grow and learn and be ahead of the crowd of pre-school children. Another plus...it dosen't push a particular value system on your children. It is straight foward. I personally find that refreshing, compared to all of the politically correct children's programming out there. I reccomend this film for your child."
