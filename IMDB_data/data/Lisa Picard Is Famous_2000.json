        "reviewBody": "\"Lisa Picard Is Famous\" is a mock-umentary about, the struggle and the sacrifices one makes to get to fame. This of coarse is taken with all comic-fun otherwise it would be a worthless film. Laura Kirk is perfectly fit as Lisa Picard, and Sandra Bullock shows up in an awkward slightly wasted scene thats nevertheless a nice touch. The film is taken with such stupid slapstick that it is hard not to laugh even if it is mostly predictable. One of the main focuses is the friendship between Lisa and Tate and how it is nearly terminated, done comically well, hits a little too close to home than one would expect from this kind of film. LPIF is not really breaking any new ground, its just fun, not to mention it has a cool movie title.. try saying it a few times to people.. it makes you seem like you really \"know\" movies with quoting such a little known farce! **Attention All Aspiring Actors**... if this film teaches you one thing... its that most of you really should re-evaluate yourself, give it up to save heartache, or (to put it boldly) admit to yourself that you really don't have what it takes... After all it is truly a shot in the dark, even if there is a little \"Lisa Picard\" in all of us."
