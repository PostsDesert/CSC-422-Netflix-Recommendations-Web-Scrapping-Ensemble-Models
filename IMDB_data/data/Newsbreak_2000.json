But today even the \"investigative reporter caught in intrigue\" hook cannot save this film, considering that films like \"I Love Trouble\" have already pulled this off with much greater flair.\n\nTo top things off, Judge Reinhold delivers one of his worst performances ever, considering how well he has played clich√©d roles in the past. Yet another aspect of this movie that would have been better 20 years ago.",
