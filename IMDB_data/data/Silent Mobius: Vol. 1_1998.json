But when I watched the series on Tech TV's \"Anime Unleashed\",I was right. It truly was the best. But after seeing some of the episodes, the show went off the air. I was disappointed,but I had to see it again,and I got my chance. When I bought the DVD Collection at Best Buy, I got to see all the episodes that I've seen on \"Anime Unleashed\",and they were the best that I ever seen. And my favorite characters in the series were Katsumi,and Grosspoliner.And my favorite song in the show \"Til the end of time\". So in closing,if you have seen it on Anime Unleashed,then see it again. It's the best.",
