Although I applaud the English Dub actors and the visuals, it let me down with a pretty boring and rubbish storyline. I felt the whole storyline just seems like a recipe for disaster but making it something that came out of a bad disney movie. I'm definitely not talking about \"The Little Mermaid\" here, I'm talking about the ones who failed miserably to captivate audiences and seemed like they lack creativity by copying other disney made ones.\n\nJust go with the 1991 version for your own sake!",
