        "reviewBody": "After reading the many comments and watching the movie several times, I think I realize why Albert's friend was French. The people he was closest to in his former life were the French magician and his wife/partner. Therefore it made sense that his imaginary friend was like them. I loved the movie and though Harriet seemed to change suddenly in some people's opinion, I think she was changing throughout the movie. The looks she gave and the thoughts that seemed to be going through her mind, were very evident of that fact. Gérard Depardieu was excellent in the part of Bogus, the evidence between him being so big and the boy so small. How many times have we as adults wished for someone big and strong to take us up and give us comfort? I loved the ending where he wandered away to help another child. Sometimes in my life, I wish for someone like him. He also has a lovely smile. Good movie for that time when you are wanting something different."
