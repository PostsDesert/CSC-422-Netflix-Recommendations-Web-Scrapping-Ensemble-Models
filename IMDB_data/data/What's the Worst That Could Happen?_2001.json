Were we watching a different film as l could find nothing even remotely amusing about this title. Not only did we not even smile but neither did anyone else in the house this was everything a comedy should not be, what is it with Lawrence's facial movements annoying or what! imagine the worst Hope/Crosby title and times it by three then you might somewhere near how bad this film is, on a positive note l also used imdb's review of \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" as a guide, now there's a funny movie but that's another story....... Sorry Popa Joe Algarve/Portugal"
