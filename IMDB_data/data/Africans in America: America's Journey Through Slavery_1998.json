Never sensationalizing history, one still comes away realizing how much each of us in the United States owes to the Africans upon whose forced labor our entire economy was built.\n\nI came away from it wondering what it will take for Americans of all colors to finally realize how this country came to be what it is. We are a nation that has been influenced by countless sources, but none more important nor more lasting than the institution of slavery.",
