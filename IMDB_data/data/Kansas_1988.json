        "reviewBody": "Outstanding performances by Dillon & McCarthy. Great scenery throughout the movie. A young Kyra Sedgewick has a small role as Matt Dillon's girlfriend. Also look for Alan Toy (Professor Finley from 90210) as a news paper reporter. Very underrated. Recommended very highly. I rank this up there with Less Than Zero, Fresh Horses & St Elmos's Fire for McCarthy. One of the top actors of the 80's. The DVD only has an Original Theatrical Trailer. No other special features are on there. At around $10.00, this is a nice deal. Most stores don't carry this obscure gem but it is very available through Amazon or any other vendors on the Net. Hope you enjoy this outstanding movie that doesn't get the credit it deserves."
