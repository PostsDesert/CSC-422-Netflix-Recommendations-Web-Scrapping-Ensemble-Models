I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for just being \"guilty pleasure\" escapist entertainment. Yes the movie is silly and corny - but that was the intent of the film.\n\nIts more than understandable that this movie isn't for everybody, either you love it or hate it. However, if you watched the movie and took it seriously (ie the breakdancing during the first 'hit'), then you definitely missed the point. 8 out of 10.",
