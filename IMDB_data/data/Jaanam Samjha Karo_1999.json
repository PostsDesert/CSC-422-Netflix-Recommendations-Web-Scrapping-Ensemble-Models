Womanizer Rahul (Salman Khan) sees her and is determined to seduce her, but she is not taken in by his lies. \n\nThis romantic drama showcases Matondkar's excellent dancing with some impressive musical numbers. Shammi Kapoor is great in his role as Grandfather. While this is a familiar role for Khan, he does it well enough that I intensely disliked him at times. The plot was good, predictable in it's happy ending, but still enjoyable. Overall, it's an entertaining film for Bollywood fans.",
