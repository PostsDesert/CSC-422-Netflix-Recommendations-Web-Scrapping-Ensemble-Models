Perhaps that's why I disagree with what most critics say.\n\nPerhaps I love it for sentimental reasons knowing that Candy died just before the movie was completed. Nonetheless we had a good laugh and I do recommend this as a good pop corn movie.\n\nThe main premise of the movie is that there are a group of individuals in a small western town that have had it with \"The Code\" of the west. They hire a drunken guide (Candy) to take them back east and thus starts the comedy of errors as they go against the grain.\n\nAdmittedly the acting is only fair at best, but then again most of these characters are comedians do a pretty good job of playing off each other.",
