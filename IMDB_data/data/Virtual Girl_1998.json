I thought that this film was just a soft porn film, but the amazing thing is that there really is a plot. The plot is plausible and gripping, and it could really have been developed into a major film.\n\nMany a times, the graphics of this film looks like a college graduate production. It is probably because of the low budget, but this explains why the film went straight to video."
