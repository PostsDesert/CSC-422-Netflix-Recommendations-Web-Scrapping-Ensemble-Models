        "reviewBody": "This movie is simply great. This movie had debutant actors who came up with good performance. The actors will get unnoticed since they are so real in the movie. The story is not something you have never heard, but still it is a well narrated story with good comedy. The movie is not also just a dumb comedy but also has some message for the society. Movies like this should be definitely screened on in USA and Europe. It is no wonder that one of the debutant Arshad Warsi ( who plays Ballu) has turned out to be a one of the good actors from India. People have finally accepted him after his performance in Munna Bhai MBBS. One of the actress Priya Gill also did not have much success in Bollywood but she was good too but really could not impress the audience because she was not the typical Bollywood typecast actress.As very important part of any Indian commercial movie it has good songs which are both melodies as well as peppy.",
