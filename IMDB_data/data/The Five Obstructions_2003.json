This is for you if you respect the maverick minds of filmmakers playing with each other's head. This is for you if you can appreciate the intention behind this documentary. This is for you if you would like to see a veteran filmmaker being challenged to remake an earlier short film of his. \n\nAlso if you are so used to being spoon fed with a steady dose of ulcer generating colored candy, forget all about renting this gem.Here's hoping there wont be people who watch this, get disgruntled and then plaster all over the internet with not so kind reviews.\n\nInstead, here's hoping these filmmakers come back with a sequel- if that beautiful being called Jorgen Leth agrees!."
