The story is realistic, told in an interesting way, the steamy parts give it a nice spice and it's overall a good drama that doesn't get dull. The actors are great. I binged it in 3 days it's been very addictive to watch. I love the way they mix different perspectives and different points in time. It's really well made to convey the story and make you feel it, understand the characters and walk in their shoes. I'm glad there will be a next season and looking forward to it. Overall a great watch if you are into that type and genre. If you are not you will probably not like it, but hey, don't spoil its rating because it's not your cup of tea.",
