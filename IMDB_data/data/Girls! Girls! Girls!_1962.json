        "reviewBody": "This certainly isn't one of Elvis'good movies -- but it holds a sentimental favorite place in my heart. It was one of the first Elvis movies I ever saw.\n\nSet amongst the islands of Hawaii, Presley plays tuna-fisherman/tour-guide Ross Carpenter, trying to make ends meet so he can buy his dream boat and go into business for himself. Adding complications is Carpenter's love triangle with two very different dames: jaded nightclub singer Robin (Stella Stevens), and young heiress Laurel (Laurel Goodwin), who's looking to experience life on the other side of the social divide.\n\nWith it's exotic location filming and the charm of Presley, GIRLS! GIRLS! GIRLS! is a pleasant movie to watch. It is worth reminding ourselves that Elvis did not write the scripts for the films. Hollywood did. Anything you don't like about any of Elvis' legendary movies, blame Hollywood. But mostly blame his greedy over-bearing manager, 'col' Tom Parker. He put all the deals together!",
