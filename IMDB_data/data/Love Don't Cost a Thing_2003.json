Did you collect Garbage Pail Kids while the NKOTB-buttoned girls played Care Bears and Kid Sister?\n\nIf you did, then there's a chance you had to suffer through quite a few 80's films.. Or rather, it felt like you were being made to suffer, way back when.\n\nWe're a little older now, maybe more mature and hopefully a little more open to rediscovering the 80's.\n\n\"Can't Buy Me Love\" is an 80's masterpiece I still enjoy today. Dempsey's nasal sonnets, his little brother's hustles and their parents' 30-something attitude to everything are classic. Ranked up there with \"Weird Science\", \"Real Genius\" and \"Raising Arizona\", the original tested the times while paving new ground.\n\n\"Love Don't Cost A Thing\" is a paycheck for the producers whose idea of a good time must be making K-Mart xerox copies of ideas they wished they had first.\n\nIf they have a Triple-Gold Globe Awards for the likes of Master P and Snoop's acting quality, I'll make sure to steal a cell phone and call the 900 number that gives your ghetto fabulous trash 5 Bling-Blings and two slaps across your face on GP, Uuuugh.\n\nThis 'Movie' is hard to flush, let alone swallow."
