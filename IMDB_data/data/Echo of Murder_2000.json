Travanti, who is perfectly cast as \"Lon Stevens\".\n\nAs the IMDb summary says, even with what appears to be conclusive evidence that Gil Atkens is innocent, Barnaby Jones has a hunch that something else is afoot. Can he find out what, if anything, is going on here?\n\nI rate \"Echo of a Murder\" 10 stars.",
