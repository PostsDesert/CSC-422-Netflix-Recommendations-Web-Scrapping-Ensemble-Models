        "reviewBody": "It is always easy to comment on these documentary's. David Attenbourough is simply the best naturalist their is, not only because of his witty charm and extremely interesting information, but it is his voice. A voice that I myself used to grow up with on Saturday mornings \"Nature\" when their used to be education on TV, not the Digimon/Pokemon Crap they have now.\n\nThis particular series is exceptional because along with his useful commentary the producers add in a number of special camera's to see the things that humans almost never get to see. Also animation against live backdrops of what pre-historic birds might have looked based on fossil research. I never had such admiration of birds until I saw this documentary. It is a must see",
