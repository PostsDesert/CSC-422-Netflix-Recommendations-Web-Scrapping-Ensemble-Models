The corrupt officials offer him an arranged marriage to get him on their side. She is hot but Sam already has a girl and will not be corrupted. This will not go well for our Sam.\n\nThis is the last movie of a three part series. It is also the last movie for Do Siu-Chun and Zhang Chang-Jun, two great martial artists. The series goes out with a fizzle, too much drama and not enough fights. The plot point, obvious from the title, is completely unnecessary and poorly executed as the missing arm seemed only hidden under his shirt.\n\nOverall, could have been better, but once you watch the first two you might as well watch this once.",
