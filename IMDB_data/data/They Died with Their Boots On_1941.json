        "reviewBody": "Aside from the historical inaccuracies well noted by most of the previous commentators, 'Boots' is satisfying in all departments--good script, direction, music, etc. and is elevated by the chemistry between Flynn and de Havilland, both giving their best performances since 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' six years before. Action fans will enjoy the skirmishes with Indians in shoot-em-up western style with Flynn as the flamboyant leader of men in the 7th cavalry. The 'Garry Owens' tune is woven nicely into the rest of the score, an impressive one by Max Steiner that has recently been released by Marco Polo records on a gorgeous CD courtesy of the Moscow Sympony Orchestra with good notes on the film. Arthur Kennedy is excellent as the chief villain of the piece and Sydney Greenstreet scores as General Winfield Scott. Anthony Quinn is effective as Crazy Horse and Gene Lockhart is amusing as Samuel Bacon (Olivia's father), at first opposed to his daughter's suitor. Hattie McDaniel is delicious as Callie, the maid who has some amusing domestic scenes with de Havilland for some much needed comic relief. Changing Custer's real-life story to suit the heroic mold of Errol Flynn's screen persona is forgivable, if only for the final results which turned this story behind Custer's famous last stand into an epic western adventure."
