        "reviewBody": "This show has been out for almost 12 years. While I love it, I do have to admit that it's later episodes aren't even close to being as good as the originals. \n\nSeasons 1-2: Hysterical. Did not stop laughing.\n\nSeason 3: Still amazing. I miss Dr. Weird but Spacecataz is still funny.\n\nSeason 4: Where most people think it started going downhill. I like it, although I do admit it isn't as good as the first three. They now have more freedom in the maturity factor, and boy do they abuse it throughout the rest of the series.\n\nSeason 5: Bleh. Don't even bother watching the first three episodes of it. This season does get better as it goes on, and I have to admit that \"Bible Fruit\" is one of my favorite episodes. This is where they really start relying on sex jokes and shock humor, but it's still funnier than other shows that attempt to do this.\n\nSeason 6: Better than season 5, but still suffers from the same laziness as last time where many of the jokes are just mindless sex jokes rather than actual creative writing. Just not as bad as before.\n\nSeason 7: Better than season 6. Has a couple of my favorite episodes and is a step in the right direction, as \"A PE Christmas\" and \"Rabbot Redux\" are two of my favorite episodes.\n\nSeason 8 (also known as \"Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1\"): A MASSIVE improvement. I thought at this point there was no hope for improvement, but I was completely wrong. Has a nice balance between mature humor and good writing.\n\nSeason 9 (also known as \"Aqua Something You Know Whatever): Recoil. Their efforts are going entirely the wrong way. With all the other seasons I complained about, I at least still enjoyed all of them. Not the case here. VERY hit and miss. Literally half the episodes in this series have no redeeming qualities about them, but that does mean that the other half is pretty damn good. Just make sure to skip \"Shirt Herpes\", \"Rocket Horse Jet Chicken\", \"The Granite Family\", \"Fightan Titan\", and \"Totem Pole\". I was bored out of my mind through those.\n\nOverall, a very good show. They just need to refocus their efforts a bit. I hope Season 10 will be better than the last one, though.",
