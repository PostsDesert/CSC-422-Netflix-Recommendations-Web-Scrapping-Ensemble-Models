Joe the Movie. It's about this kid named Gage who finds a magical creature named Munchie. Munchie ends up making Gage's life perfect. Seriously, there is pizza in his life and everything. This film will also teach you and your kids valuable lessons. Yes, it is OK to throw away food in your bedroom. Whoever made up that rule is obviously wrong cause Gage does it in this movie. It will also teach you that it is OK to hijack an airplane as long as it's for fun. Most importantly it teaches you not to crash your car into the donut shop cause there are cops in there. Watching this film is one thing everyone should do in their lifetime. It's easily more important than graduating high school.",
