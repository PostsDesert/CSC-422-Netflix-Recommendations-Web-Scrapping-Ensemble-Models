You've got Marc Singer when he was young and fit (not leathery and ancient like in the later movies of this series) and Tanya Roberts who is hot in this film. You've got swordfights, sorcery, the whole works. That said, I did find the ferrets a little annoying, but that's just me.\n\nOn the whole the movie works well and there are some touches, like the flying humanoids that envelop and dissolve their prey, that just make the film.\n\nSUMMARY: Hero who can talk to animals sets out to overthrow an evil warlord.",
