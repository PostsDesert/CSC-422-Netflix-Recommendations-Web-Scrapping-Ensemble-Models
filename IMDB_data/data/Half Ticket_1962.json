They had poor sense of humour in those days.\n\nKishore Da marvellous . Even hard core fan of Kishore da as a singer would hardly know that the song he sang \" AAKE SEEDHI LAGI DIL PE KATARIYA\" in the movie (for both male and female voice) , the male voice played back by Kishore Da for Actor Pran was typically sang in actor Pran's accent and still not even managed to sing both sexes voice but did the history.\n\nThis makes Kishore Da ahead of any Great singer- He is Just Versatile , immaculate. He is EVEREGREEN actor & Singer. Besides this he was great Director/ Producer, Music Director, Lyricist ,Script writer and a Great Yoodler.",
