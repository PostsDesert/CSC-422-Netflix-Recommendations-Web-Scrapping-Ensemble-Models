The actors are pretty lame and try to compensate by being over the top and dramatic, but even so these grand dramatics do not add amusement or entertainment.\n\nOne of the main actors insists on taking of his clothes of at every opportunity much to my horror as he seems to have a half shaved chest or some kind of pigment discolouration which just made me feel ill at the mere sight of it.\n\nIn summary this is a lame rip off of American Pie, down to the sex scene with the pie. I would say don't do it, specially at the prices they are trying to charge for it on DVD!",
