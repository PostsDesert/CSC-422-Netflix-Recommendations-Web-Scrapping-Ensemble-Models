He is on the brink of being a loser. He is counselled in therapy by a psychiatrist and it is that relationship which takes center stage in the play.\n\nIn flash-backs and therapy the source and remedies to Antwones angst are revealed.\n\nOutstanding performances from the whole cast. The story is in effect a family tragedy with emotional and physical torment. All the actors give full blooded performances with conviction and realism.\n\nOne message from the movie is the importance of raising children decently.\n\nThe real Antwone deserves success. To have endured wickedness as a child but to rise above that, shows a magnificent character.\n\nAnd to all those out there who have endured such torment but to have survived and succeeded: you are all winners. 10 out of 10.",
