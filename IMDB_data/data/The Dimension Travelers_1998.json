        "reviewBody": "During the late 90s and most of the 2000s there was a lot of directors who tried out their artistic skills with experimentation movies, Dimension Travelers is a great experience of what is real or fiction.\n\nMidori is a high school student that lives a boring life, with arguments with parents, bullies as friends, and in her spare time she collect flowers and hide them in books in the library. One day a new student arrives, her name is Mayumi, eventhough she acts weird, she does fascinate Midori a lot and they become friends, finally Mayumi reveals to Midori that she is a dimension traveler and Midori is one as well, once Midori how to travel through the dimensions, she suddenly wake up in a psychiatric clinic, was it all just imagination or is the clinic a trick by the enemy?\n\nThe movie is brilliant of playing with our minds and also thanks to the girl who played the role of Midori, when she is a student she is a student, when she is in the clinic she acts like someone who could out of her mind, and when she play as an adult she is adult, it's great acting and according to the DVD by pulp cinema asia she was only 17 when playing the role.\n\nI would recommend to everyone this 1990s classic.",
