There is interesting crew to interact with. There's even a cat. As with nearly all wonderful love stories a war constantly intrudes into their yet to be consummated intimate relationship. \n\nLafiel is in command of the ship but she doesn't possess all the skills necessary to make a great captain. So there's lots of training going on initially. That allows the crew to get accustomed to each other. Lafiel starts out a bit on the cranky side because of her lack of skills. The crew is basically terrified of her because when the Imperial Princess is cranky another location would be nice to go to but their aboard a space ship so.... Don't miss this wonderful saga.",
