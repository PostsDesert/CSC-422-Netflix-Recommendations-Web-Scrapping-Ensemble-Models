        "reviewBody": "The former lead singer with \"Fleetwood Mac,\" gives a concert at Denver's \"Red Rocks\" outdoor amphitheater in 1987, and it was a disappointment, at least to me.\n\nBeing a fan of her smoky voice, pretty looks and song interpretations, maybe I expected too much. A lot of times you can find out just how good a singer is when you hear them in person, instead of the studio making them sound perfect.\n\nI found out Nicks isn't that good a singer as she sounds on disc. What's more, I was totally turned off and disgusted she resorted to profanity in a couple of her songs, even saying \"G- damn\" in one of them. From what I have read, she's into witchcraft, too, which is pretty weird. Anyway, her raspy voice sounded poor and this was not an impressive concert.\n\nI thought it might be fun to see and hear Mick Fleetwood and Peter Frampton, who are billed as guest stars, but they just played backup and didn't have much of a role in here. There are 14 songs in all, the best one being the finale although part of it is just her shaking hands with people in the audience.\n\nFor a beautiful setting like Red Rocks, I thought the lighting was just so-so, not as dynamic as it good have been, sort of like Nick's performance.",
