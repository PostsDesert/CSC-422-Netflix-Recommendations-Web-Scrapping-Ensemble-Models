Especially this nice way with close shots and many details.\n\nThe Life of Mammals look for me little older, than filmed in 2002, it look as something +- 1990 or similar quality. Because it, my vote for this beauty series isn't higher. The quality isn't so high, how it may be...\n\nIn summary this is good education film about mammals, each its part is well separated.\n\nComments are well and not too scientific, so this film may be good for all age groups especially the youngest ones.\n\nFor me personally may be the film little more scientific. I'm see his main purpose to teach kids in elementary school. But its good for older too...",
