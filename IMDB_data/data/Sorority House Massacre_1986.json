Soon the killer returns to continue his bloody rampage and murder a bunch of screaming sorority girls and their boyfriends. \n\nThe killer is a lot like Micheal Myers without the mask. He has a big knife, he is a heavy breather who doesn't say much, and he likes to stand in shadows a lot. He does, however, have a much faster pace. Extremely low budget, acting is nothing special, cinematography looks like something a kid could do, but with a running time of 1 hour and 15 minutes not a total waste of time for slasher fans.\n\n* out of ****"
