        "reviewBody": "ROAD TRIP is a movie with well focused hilarity from start to finish. It is raunchy and wonderful, capturing college days with a light hearted frivolity that really tickled me so that I felt sick from laughing. The New York Times critic reviewed it on Friday, May 19th and said it much better than I can. He also loved the movie and found it very appealing, although neither of us is the age of the target audience, I suspect. I am 64 and love comedies. The sex and comedy is not at all offensive to viewers who have a well developed sense of humor. Sure, the serious and critical audience who love to find fault with any comedic effort will turn their noses up at this film. I do not recommend that they see this superb comedy. Tom Green is not the central character but he is very good in his role. The other cast members may not be well known but after this film it's just a matter of time before they are leading stars. All of the casting is just perfect. Photography and music are excellent. If this is the first of the quality that Montecito Pictures will produce they are a studio to follow in the future. Go see this film. Buy a box of popcorn and a Coke. Be careful not to choke on the popcorn from uncontrollable laughter. Take a long, hard swallow of the Coke and calm down. You will remember this evening for years!"
