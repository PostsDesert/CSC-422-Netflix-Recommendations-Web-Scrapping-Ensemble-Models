Most of her work were musicals, which is probably why I had never heard of her - not my favorite genre. This movie wasn't billed as one but there's some singing and dancing as well. I can see why though: Betty Hutton is a ball of fire. She sings, she dances, she jokes - she would bounce off the walls if she could. It would be a waste not to make full use of her talents. \n\nThe movie's supposedly biographical but it feels more like a Hutton showcase, though grande dame Constance Collier stands out too. It's too bad the story mostly feels forced - the whole romance bit with her chauvinistic boss... ugh. Still, Pauline showcases Hutton's charm well and that's something at least.",
