        "reviewBody": "Well done, more human than some of the other documentaries of the time. Some incredible shots of the Hilary Step that I had not seen before. Focuses on the year after the tragic - \"Into Thin Air\" expeditions with some of the same characters included. Also includes some interesting scientific studies done on the effects of high altitude on climbers (specifically the long term effects). For me, the weakest part of this documentary is Jodi Foster's narration. She seems to be going through the motions and several times became annoyed at the what seemed to me her, \"I am Jodi Foster and yes I am narrating this, just don't forget I am Jodi Foster\" attitude. Unlike, for example, DeNiro's excellent narration in the Lenny Bruce documentary \"Swear to Tell the Truth\" she becomes somewhat overbearing and omnipresent. Other than that, a very well done documentary and a great companion piece to the Imax Movie \"Everest\".",
