        "reviewBody": "For people who believe in second chances. \"Last Dance\" belongs to my top 10 lawyer movies of all time below \"A Few Good Men,\" \"Class Action\" and \"The Verdict.\" I've seen this movie a dozen of times and as a law student I must say that it is better than your average John Grisham legal drama maybe except for \"The Rainmaker.\" This film takes on the professional and ethical dilemma of a young clemency attorney Rick Hayes played by Rob Morrow who befriends a death row inmate convicted of double murder Cindy Liggett played by Sharon Stone. She is about to be executed. He moves heaven and earth to save her from death by lethal injection. The rest of the cast are excellent from Peter Gallagher and Jack Thompson. Randy Quaid gives a very good performance as a sarcastic veteran clemency attorney Sam Burns.",
