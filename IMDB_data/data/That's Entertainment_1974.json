This is the Holy grail of musical documentaries, the very definition of the term \"They don't make 'em like this anymore..\" everyone is here and in the subsequent 2 sequels. Oh, to see this in a movie theatre! 20 foot tall Gene Kelly performing \"Singing In The Rain\"! Busby Berkeley as his extravanganzas were meant to be seen! Definately worth watching even of you see it on video! A time capsule, a treasure. (sigh... Hollywood...)"
