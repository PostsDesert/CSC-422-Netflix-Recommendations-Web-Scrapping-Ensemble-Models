        "reviewBody": "Just got this in the mail and I highly recommend it. In most respects, it's better than the VFTV series of videos for the fact there are several cameras in the audience so you feel more like you are there. In the VFTV series, they are just taken from the cameras used for the giant screens in the stadiums so there are no cameras in the audience and very little audience is seen.\n\nThis video does still have some of the same goofy, trippy visuals to go along with the music (why do they do that?), but the addition of a couple very funny comedy sketches (with help from Al Franken's old partner Tom Davis) and some live interview segments where the boys field questions of audience members on video tape. The last question apparently coming from one of Jerry's daughters who asks when \"daddy is going to get me a car?\" Good stuff.\n\nAs for the music, the set list is top notch and the boys are in a good mood and it shows."
