        "reviewBody": "My favourite version of Les Miz yet - despite it being only semi-staged. Most of the cast are spot on, though a couple of the male bit-parts could do with toning down the melodrama. I think this version is more frenetically paced than usual, giving it a great energy, but there are points where it could afford to breathe more. Boe's \"Bring Him Home\" is perfect and devastating. Fletcher is stunning. \"Turning\" is still useless. Women and gays will probably enjoy Enjolras in particular. I'll take the Albert Hall version of Phantom, and this version of Les Miz. If I owned the Hooper/Jackman version or the 25th anniversary version, they'd be straight in the bin. The charity bag. 8/10"
