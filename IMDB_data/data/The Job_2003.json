They get double-crossed by team member Steve (Edward Norton) and John is killed. After finding Steve in L.A., Charlie reassembles the team to rob Steve and get revenge. However, he needs the help of John Bridger's daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron), a professional safe cracker who uses her skills for good. This also stars Seth Green, Mos Def, and Jason Statham as members of the team. That's a great group of actors, and they had a fun time driving Mini Coopers thru L.A. traffic and under L.A. And I think we all had fun.",
