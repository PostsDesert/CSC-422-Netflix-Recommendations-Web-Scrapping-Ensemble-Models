        "reviewBody": "I LOVE this film, particularly the scene at the dress store, with Dorothy Lamour.\n\nYes, the 2nd model out, IS the one and only Terri Garr. The last dancer out - the one doing the INCREDIBLE 'Swim,' is Ms. Toni Basil.\n\nThese two women have a combined history (which might've started here. Does anyone know?), as, it was shortly after this film, that Terri became a dancer on the late, great ShInDiG!, with Toni as both a dancer and choreographer.\n\nI saw some reviews here which were practically out for blood in their negativity, their dislike of this film. \n\nThe one that stuck in my craw, was the person who said they were in high school (in LA) at the time, and this film was so bad, they couldn't sit through it - 'FIVE(?!?!) times.'\n\nO - kaaaaay.\n\nWhile it's true, it's not the best, it does have things going for it, starting with Tommy Kirk, who I've always liked. I can only imagine how he felt, to basically be given the 'beach movie mantle' - ALONE. \n\nThat had to be a little unnerving tonhave that weight put on you. But, he did have the help of Annette, and a truly fun cast, with everyone from Buster Keaton, through to Dorothy ('poor me, pour me another drink') Kilgallen (huh?).\n\nYes, it's stupid, but, it's fun. It's not supposed to be anything other than lightweight fluff, and, it does it's job admirably.\n\nEvery time this film comes on, I'm front-and-centre, waiting up for that terrific dance at the dress store.\n\nAnd, again, to the person who hates this - but, keeps seeing it: you keep saying you leave after only the 1st few minutes. There are very few films that are great after only a few minutes.\n\nNext time you 'force' yourself to (try and) watch PAJAMA PARTY...just try to at least see Dorothy, Terri, and Toni? You might end up with a smile."
