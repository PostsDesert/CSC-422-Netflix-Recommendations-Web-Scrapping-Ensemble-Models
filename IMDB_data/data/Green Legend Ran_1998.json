        "reviewBody": "I remember being told to \"Think Green\". After watching \"Green Legend Ran\", I am even more wary of environmentalist thought. \"Green Legend Ran\" is a clever fable that takes the issue of environmentalism and injects it with a dose of anti-religious sentiment. What you are left with is a tale of tragedy, mystery, violence, and even ignorance. Even though the animation and story is somewhat draggy and out of sync, we have intriguing portrait of boy named Ran who is torn between loving a girl and avenging the death of his mother. He doesn't really understand the events in the world that are out of his control (hence the ignorance). Ran is unlike any hero I have seen in the anime genre because he doesn't fit the stereotype of the conquering hero. \"Green Legend\" runs long at over two hours but it should not take away from viewing such a masterful heroic story. I really liked \"Green Legend\" and I recommend it to anyone who has not seen it. I give it a 9 out of 10!\n\nHere ends my rant!",
