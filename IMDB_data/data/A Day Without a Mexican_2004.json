There are several references to prominent Mexican personalities that have immigrated to USA and also to the states that belonged to Mexico and have been incorporated to the USA. However, the plot is limited to one joke only and wasted in a boring and unnecessary soap-opera. My vote is five. \n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Um Dia sem Mexicanos\" (\"A Day Without Mexicans\")",
