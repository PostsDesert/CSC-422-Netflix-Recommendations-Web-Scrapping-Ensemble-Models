        "reviewBody": "The acting and cinematography and music are absolutely lovely--first rate all the way. And, in many instances the story is very interesting and engaging. However, at times, I felt I really needed to struggle to keep watching the film, as the characters, in general, are unlikable. The townspeople slowly reveal themselves to be shallow jerks and the grandfather is obviously like this as well, but at least by the end of the film he's more likable and multifaceted. Perhaps the only ones who you feel drawn towards are the cute granddaughters BUT they have such creepy dubbed voices that at first I thought this might be some sort of EXORCIST rip-off. While the older girl's voice isn't as creepy, the younger one sounds exactly like an older woman DUBBING the voice of a young girl. How can they spend so much money and effort to produce such an excellent film and have this creepy cheap-sounding voice? Oh well, it's probably NOT something that will bother every viewer but little things like this really take me out of the moment.",
