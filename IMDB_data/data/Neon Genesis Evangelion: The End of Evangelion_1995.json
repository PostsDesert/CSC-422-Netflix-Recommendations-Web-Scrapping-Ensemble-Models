I was just getting a feel for the information I was being presented and the things I was seeing.\n\nAs I went on through the episodes, it became more and more clear to me that the show gave so much symbolism and analogies related to humans, AI, and creation.\n\nWhen I watched the last episode and additional movie to cap off the Evangelion, it became so clear to me what I was watching. I had major self realizations too.\n\nThis show was one for the books. And I got to learn some Japanese along the way.",
