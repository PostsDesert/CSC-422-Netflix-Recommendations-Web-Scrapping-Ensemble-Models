She documents prayer at the Great Mosque of Qom, Kashan, the land of Zarathustra, and male and female dervishes in Kurdistan. Through her examination of these various spiritual influences, she comments on the use of religion as a buffer between the pull of Western culture and the rules of traditional society. the film is beautifully narrated by the Academy Award nominee Shohreh Aghdashloo.",
