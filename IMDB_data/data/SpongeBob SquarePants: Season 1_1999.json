        "reviewBody": "Overall, I liked this show and loved it as a young child back at the 90s when it was first released on nickelodeon. The first three seasons were amazing with some creative plot lines for each episode (not to mention the funny and witty humor/jokes) and also revolves around every situation my favorite characters are going through and are handled quite well throughout the show. The animation is pretty with fluid backgrounds and brilliant character designs. The characters are likable and timeless as ever. Spongebob and Patrick are dumb, but smart and Squidward is mean, but also likable, Mr. Krabs is funny and Plankton is evil and also funny. Even the new characters in the first three seasons are great and executed the show perfectly with some talented voice actors like Tom Kenny, Clancy Brown and others.\n\nThen, in 2006, two years after the release of it's first feature length film, \"The Spongebob Squarepants Movie\", the show started to go downhill with seasons 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 with the story lines being the same and the majority of those seasons now becomes repetitive. The characters have ranged from likable to very irritating and the pacing is too damn awful! The new episodes started to make me cringe as I wished the show would've just ended with season 3, but nope. Instead, the writers decided to give up and started to continue the franchise as it becomes to get quite boring and predictable which resulted in destroying a great reminder of my childhood! \n\nIf you watch the first three seasons that reminded you of your childhood instead of the later ones, then you are welcome to for this is one of the greatest shows in television history.",
