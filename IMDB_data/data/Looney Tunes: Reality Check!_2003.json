These are NOT the original versions which feature the voice characterizations of Mel Blanc. Any time you put in new voices on cartoons that you know well it just doesn't seem right. This collection is no exception. Not only are the voices wrong the stories have not been crafted with the same care. The stories seem very much out of place as well. If you watched the Looney Tunes Movie \"Back In Action\" you will understand that these are just not the same. For me it was disappointing to watch what they have done to these characters that I grew up with and loved watching over and over."
