Second (after exploring this site): where was video quality during its mastering (ain't that a fake?)\n\nHonestly, \"Live\" subsection in main menu was rather good. I adore Moby for his music. Not for the \"Plays\" like that.\n\n\"Give an idiot a camcorder\" as were announced... Really. CC in the hands of an idiot. \n\nAnyway - MOBY is MOBY, and now we can enjoy his music even with that shabbiness of video & audio quality.\n\nAnd, of course, such gorgeous tracks like \"Honey\", \"Why does my heart so bad\", \"Natural blues\", \"Porcelain\"... This is Moby. Last and all the time!",
