        "reviewBody": "A beautiful love story. Shot entirely on location in NYC. Chow Yun Fat, as a gambling slacker, falls in love with his recently jilted distant cousin, Jennifer. The plot is relatively simple, with a predictable O'Henry-ish twist, but the power of this movie comes from the details.\n\nChow Yun Fat, in a completely different mode from his action films, is subtle, vulnerable, and amazing. Just watching his expression shifting from elation to despair as the camera lingers on his face is heart-breaking.\n\nThe direction isn't flashy, but a few shots make very good use of the NYC locale: the sight of CYF running through the graffiti-covered streets, skipping with happiness, is contrasted by him dejectedly strolling while an endless line of taxicabs file past him. And as the title suggests, the autumn season is effectively evoked.\n\nThe movie is a bit old, so the wardrobe/hairstyles look dated. Also, the quality of the picture & general production value leaves something to be desired. Will disappoint CYF fans who are used to seeing him just be ultra-cool. But well worth the effort. (Also, you do get to see ultra-cool CYF in the final scene.)",
