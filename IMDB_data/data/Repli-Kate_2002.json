Forget the science that supplies the basic premise for the film, it is all hokey (though the book Landry is reading when we first meet her is a currently important text), but if you go along with the impossible premise of the story, it raises some questions that my wife and I enjoyed talking about. I wondered if some of the guys in our society would understand that this film is about them, but they don't get it, just as Landry - thinking like a man - does not get it. The film is full of stereotypes, but they are all fairly enjoyable, and together they make something that is greater than the sum of the parts. But above all - it is Landry who shines as she plays two different roles to the hilt.",
