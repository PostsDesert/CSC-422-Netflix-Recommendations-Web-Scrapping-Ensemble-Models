This show has great animation for its time, and I find the show enormously entertaining. I love the theme tune, very catchy, and the writing is always amusing. I love the characters too, especially Scooby, wonderfully voiced by Don Messick, and Casey Kasem as Shaggy never fails to bring a smile to my face. Fred, Velma and Daphne are great too, and the villains are memorable with only 49ner being a disappointment(too obvious), from Captain Redbeard, the Creeper and the really creepy ghost of Captain Cutler, I can't actually decide which one's my favourite. As much as I like the Scooby Doo Show and most of the movies, this show will always be my favourite. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",
