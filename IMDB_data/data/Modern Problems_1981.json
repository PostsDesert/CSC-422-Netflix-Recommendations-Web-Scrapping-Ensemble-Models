Probably Chevy Chase at his lowest. Although his career has had so many low points, it's hard to say. He must be a masochist who deliberately chooses godawful movies to destroy his career. Or he's a sadist who enjoys inflicting these turkeys on the rest of us. Don't listen to anyone who claims, \"Actually, it's not that bad;\" they didn't actually sit through it."
