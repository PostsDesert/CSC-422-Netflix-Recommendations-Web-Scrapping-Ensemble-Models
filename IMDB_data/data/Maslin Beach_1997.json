        "reviewBody": "This leisurely film explores the lives of a group of people spending a day at a nude beach in Australia. While the film primarily focuses on a guy who breaks up with his girlfriend, we eavesdrop on various conversations among common folk out to get a tan. Like much of the conversations, the nudity becomes mundane. The most amusing thing about the film is an ice cream vendor who rides around in his vehicle. He doesn't pay attention to his driving and sunbathers must keep watch lest they get run over. He also doesn't stop for any customers. It's not a bad way to spend an hour and a half, but neither is it something to write home about.",
