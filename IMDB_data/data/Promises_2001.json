        "reviewBody": "I only saw the second part of the movie, but that gave me enough impression to leave me in a state of \"having seen something everyone should see\". And I think everyone and most of all Israelis and Arabs will agree that a way to peace will only be possible when encounters like these will take place, where kids from both \"sides\" will meet each other to discuss and understand each other problems. I am so much impressed about the openess, sincerity, wisdom and \"the stuff that separates the youth from the adults\": playing a soccer game, making fun, sharing dreams. It's hard to see that two years after the meeting the Arab boy has almost lost his belief in a solution. A while ago I heard an interview on the radio with the famous Jewish military expert Martin von Kreefeld. This interview impressed me as much as \"Promises\", but in a very different way. To Von Kreefelds opinion, the only solution to the Jewish-Arab problem was building a high wall, deviding the two nations, probably at cost of some 30,000 lives. But then, so Von Kreefeld, there would finally be \"peace\". Well, let's just hope future generations from Israel and Palestine will proove him wrong. The documentary is filmed at high speed and will grasp your attention immediately, and will not let loose. Very impressing, very... moving ;-)"
