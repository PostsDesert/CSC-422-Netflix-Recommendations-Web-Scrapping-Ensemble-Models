There were better tap-dancers such as Eleanor Powell or Ann Miller, but Vera-Ellen was extremely good at all types of dance including balletic movement. She also had just about the most beautiful pair of legs I have ever seen & they are wonderfully show-cased in this movie. Rooprect in his review says there are two reasons for watching this movie, \"VERA-ELLEN'S LEGS\". For the ladies there are two handsome, suave & sophisticated men, David Niven & Cesar Romero, but Vera-Ellen's legs are reason enough for me! In his review of \"Happy Go Lovely\", jacob chiong says the plot is \"simple & easily digestible, the humour is light & clean\". That very succinctly sums it all up, really!."
