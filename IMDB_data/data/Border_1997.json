Especially when those whom you are fighting were your own countrymen till a few years back. A pretty good depiction of Indian Army and air force and relationship between different soldiers and their dilemma. Movie also touches on pathetic condition of Indian soldiers financially in those days which is no longer a case.Most haunting scene of Movie is Rakhi wandering in tank ridden field with Serra for his son.This single scene depicts the futility of war. But there should have been paid more attention to details of war e.g. even real life soldiers have said that they were not that outnumbered and main factor was air force not the army but it is true that they did hold a whole battalion with the help of anti tank mines.",
