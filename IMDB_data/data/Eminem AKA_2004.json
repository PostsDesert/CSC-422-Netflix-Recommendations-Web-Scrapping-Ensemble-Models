        "reviewBody": "This is actually a very good and detailed documentary, It covers everything from his child hood to his first few album. It really does help put it in perspective, it is also interesting seeing with Debbie also sharing her side of the story, even going into HER childhood a little. Seeing all the defining details,also mentioning how he found music and discovering comic books (even displaying some of his drawings) really help paints a good picture. I did enjoy how them even spending some time talking about Proof and saying how important he is to Eminem's music. Although, it did leave out quite a few details that also had just as much as anything else. Most notably his little bro Nate, who wasn't even mentioned at all, even though if you look at a lot of his songs about his mom he talks about Nate A lot even in his new song Headlights(Off of the very good album Marshal Mathers LP 2) he talked about events with Nate that really helped define him as a person. It also left out Laney, Kim's niece and having to take care of her, Em talked about her as much as he did Hallie even saying he loves her like a daughter. All together is was a really good documentary that helps take a look at the Rap God himself Marshall Mathers AKA Eminem AKA Slim Shady AKA B Rabbit AKA The White Guy from D12 AKA Evil",
