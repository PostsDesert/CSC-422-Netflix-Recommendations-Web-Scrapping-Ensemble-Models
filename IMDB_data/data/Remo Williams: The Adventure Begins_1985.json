        "reviewBody": "I can't believe that I just got around to reviewing Remo Williams. This is again one of those movies that I have been watching forever and this movie deserves repeated viewing. It is a typical corny 80's action flick and it is not mind-blowing in terms of action or special effects but it is a great ride all the same. Fred Ward turns in a great performance as Remo. I've always liked Fred Ward and he's a good underrated character actor. The supporting cast mainly just fills in the blanks but they are all competent actors. The soundtrack sets just the right mood and Joel Grey deserves special praise in the portrayal of Chiun. Chiun is the greatest and toughest character ever to be in any movie ever and Chiun could kick anyone's ass. Since Grey is white and Chiun is a stock Asian character if there ever was one it may bother some people, but I would tell those people just to get over themselves and enjoy the movie. The interplay between Remo and Chiun is funny and they have great chemistry. Bottom Line: This movie rules. I would go ahead and tell you to buy it on DVD but the powers that be have only made it available in full screen so what's the point of even having it on DVD. Damn them. Damn them to hell. Anyways, enjoy.",
