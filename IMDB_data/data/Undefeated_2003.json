The boxing sequences are some of the best I've ever seen; people are actually fighting, there's no bull.\n\nThe film has a noir quality to it: dark and moody, filled with the complexities that follow us when we pursue our dreams.\n\nTerrific performances from John Leguizamo, newcomer Adrian Martinez as \"Chewey,\" and Nester Serrano as John's trainer. The rest of the cast is rock-solid too.\n\nIf you expect this film to be a laughfest like Leguizamo's one man shows, you will be disappointed. Instead, UNDEFEATED reveals the dramatic, complex Leguizamo; and an authentic look at the friends we may have to leave behind when life forces us to make some hard choices."
