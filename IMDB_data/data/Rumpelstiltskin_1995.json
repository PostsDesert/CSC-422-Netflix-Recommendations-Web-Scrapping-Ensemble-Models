But when I saw it.........WHAM This is a good horror, and if you showed this to a kid he would cry whenever you told him the story of Rumpelstiltskin. This is a crazy film with a weird story and a pretty average ending. I would recommend this to anyone who likes horror movies like me!. I would give this a 5 out of 10."
