        "reviewBody": "This 50s grandpa must be a teenager at heart, because I thoroughly enjoyed Sandler's \"Waterboy\", originally in the theater, and now at home on network TV. It is just a comedic farce, and much better than a more recent comedic farce, \"Best In Show.\" Here the writing and the sight gags are just so much better.\n\nSandler is the college football team waterboy, who can get enraged by certain things. He gets put on the down-and-out SCLSU team, and by visualizing someone who bothers him, gets so enraged that he can break any block, and wreak havoc with any defense. Cathy Bates is his overprotective mother, Henry Winlker is his nice coach, and Jerry Reed is the dastardly opposing coach. His girlfriend, in and out of trouble, is played by Fairuza Balk.\n\nIt has the mandatory \"hero saves team and wins big game on last play with no time remaining\" scene, but here it works, because of the total absurdity of the whole premise. Maybe having grown up in south Louisiana helps me appreciate the humor. While I also appreciate the fine films at the top of the Imdb list, a good farce is hard to beat for pure entertainment.\n\nFWIW, I also really like Sandler's \"Happy Gilmore\" which is a golf spoof and total farce too."
