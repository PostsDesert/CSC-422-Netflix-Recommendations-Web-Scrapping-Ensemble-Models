        "reviewBody": "The film Freddy vs Jason is your typical slash fest with guts and blood dropping every where. Does this movie that I heard about a decade ago kinda lives up to its promise in a very weird and wonderfull way. Jason actually seems more scary than Freddy and at a point you think Jason will turn to the light when the to horror heroes battle it out. But nah hes too much of a goody two shoes to do that. The concept of the story hasnt changed much, but really doesnt tell you in detail enough on how most things happen maybe thats a spawn for several sequels to follow. The teenagers in the movie I would say have acted all very well and it doesnt go in all that typical teenager way they are quiet sensible. I think if the film had more of a plot to it would be one of the biggest movies of the year though competition was tough out their. I cant wait for part 2 though. 6.5 out of 10"
