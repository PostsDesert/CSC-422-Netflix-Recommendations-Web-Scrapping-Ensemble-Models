He is such a great villain.\n\nBut as a stand alone movie it doesn't work. If you don't remember the show you will be going where did that character come from? Why is helping them? Who is he? The episodes they put together were not consecutive episodes so too much is missing. It does not flow well. It seems rushed and choppy. It would be great to see the series in order again.",
