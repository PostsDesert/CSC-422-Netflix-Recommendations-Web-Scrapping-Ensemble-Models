Sacrificing a dozen cats who never asked for anything does not represent my conception of bringing fantasy and entertainment to an audience. \"Sure, let's throw the cat from the roof and put it on film, I'm sure the kids will love it!\" I'm not saying that no animal was ever harmed on any other shooting that this one, but there's a difference between a horse with a broken leg and five cats thrown from a cliff until one survives and the sequence is wrapped up. (I'm not making this up.) Watching Chatran is like witnessing scientific experiments on animals with the medics laughing their heads off in the background. Except here, the only goal is to make money. The ultimate hypocrisy is that it's supposed to be a charming and moving story with big moral issues about life... To think that the director of this thing is one of the most talented and popular writers in Japan really has me wondering. A sickening experience of cinematographic lobotomy. Blindness is dangerous. Stay aware."
