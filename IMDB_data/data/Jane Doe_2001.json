Story is no-nonsense, especially at the beginning, it doesn't wait for you, you have to hurry to catch up. This is as it should be.\n\nLowe is OK in his role, so are the others, Hatcher is very very good. Cox is a real treat.\n\nBut these are artists one assumes trying to make a bit of a comeback. There are so many movies like this, made for TV, and they all go the same way - why?\n\nFor there is little wrong with the directing, or the editing, or the music, or the special effects, or the acting.\n\nIt's always the screenplay. It's always the screenplay which fades, perhaps just a bit, just enough to make the movie dip down in your esteem beneath the \"this is great\" level - just enough so that said actors, directors, editors etc. never get the second chance they work so hard for.\n\nBut see this one. Made for TV rarely gets better."
