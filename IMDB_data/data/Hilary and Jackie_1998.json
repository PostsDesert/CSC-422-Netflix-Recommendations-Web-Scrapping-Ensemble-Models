        "reviewBody": "\"Hilary and Jackie\" tells of two sisters who share a love of classical music and each other but take contrasting paths through adult life. A much lauded film worthy of its critical acclaim, \"H&J\" does have a peculiar twice-told tale approach to its presentation which tends to make it interesting but so complex as to dilute its effectiveness. Nonetheless, this British film with a typically \"stiff upper lip\" approach to its sentimentality, is well shot, scripted, and acted. A good watch which will be a little \"over the top\" for many.",
