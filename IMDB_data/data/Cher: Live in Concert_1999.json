        "reviewBody": "The concert begins with Cher rising up like the phoenix from the stage, clad in a costume of her own creation - the ''Wandering Queen'' costume, complete with long wig, which she describes as a cross between Darth Maul's and Braveheart's attire - and singing U2's 'Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For', a song which she has started every tour with for about 10 years now. She is, in short, stunning. And she means to go on as she began. This is achieved by blending her newest efforts with classic Cher songs such as 'Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves', 'If I Could Turn Back Time', and 'The Shoop Shoop Song (It's In His Kiss)' complete with dancers which Cher frequently joins in their complicated choreographed moves. Plus, there are the quintessential Cher comments which go back to the days of The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour - while introducing the song 'Walking In Memphis' she refers to the video which will be playing behind her in which she is dressed as a young Elvis by saying ''All you gay guys in the audience? Don't fall in love with me 'cause I am a REALLY cute guy!'' Another highlight worth mentioning is 'Take Me Home', Cher's comeback track in the mid-70's, as much for the outfit as anything else (I won't spoil the surprise by describing it!). And then the finale - Cher bounces out in a spiky silver wig and matching silver outfit surrounded by her dancers, some of which hang from the ceiling and perform aerial acrobatics. This is, of course, 'Believe'.\n\nIn short, an amazing Cher extravaganza of some of her very best songs, punctuated with short clips of her finest acting performances on the huge screens above the stage while she herself is having one of her frequent costume changes. A truly remarkable woman with amazing talent who, despite her previous 33 years in the business, still manages to make her performances as fresh and new as ever. Viva la diva - CHER!",
