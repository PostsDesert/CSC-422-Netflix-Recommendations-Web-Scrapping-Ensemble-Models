My grandma used all her resources to manage just two tickets. So the oldest member, grandma, and the youngest member, me, saw the movie.\n\nAnd what a movie it proved to be.\n\nHero sitting in the middle of a river in an easy chair, fishing. He taming the shrew. The shrew, going by the name Vijeta Pundit, now wants a house in a garden by the lake. And the back-story.\n\nWait a minute. Add naughty Aruna Irani. Add in-great-form RD Burman. Bring in Amit Kumar - son of the late Kishore Kumar - as the fresh voice of the biggest debuting star ever, Kumar Gaurav. What we get is a blockbuster.\n\nBut hold your breath. There is a very big surprise coming. Amjad Khan. As never before.\n\nYou can't even blink start to finish.\n\nBut the titles didn't mention the directors' name. The movie didn't make itself. More backstory.\n\nReview by Hemant Singh",
