The cast is great especially the kid from Star Trek (who knew he was funny?), the guy from Who's Line... as much fun as you would expect and everyone else is recognizable and great. Although, I hadn't seen the woman who played Jane White before she was just teriffic, amazingly funny and twisted. There were some really funny moments mocking TV and our obsession with it. I don't know when it's coming out but, if you get a chance see this movie!"
