        "reviewBody": "Isn't it weird how these erotic vampire movies always seem to be all about lesbianism? I could be wrong but I don't think this is what Bram Stoker was having in mind when he wrote his famous novel Dracula.\n\nOf course this wasn't a very good movie, which should hardly come as a surprise to anyone. It's cheaply made, with silly writing, weak acting and nothing else in it that can impress.\n\nI just also can't see how anybody could enjoy this as a soft-core porn flick really. There really aren't that many sex scene's in it and there also really isn't all that much nudity in it. I have seen 'normal' movies with more nudity in it, to be frank. But I can still say that the girls are all nice looking. Normally I'm not always that impressed with the 'actresses' in soft-core movie attempts but the girls in this one were all quite nice looking. Perhaps it was because they were played by some girls in their mid-20's who were also very natural and not 'perfect' looking, as opposed to exaggerated and fabricated, Barbie-doll looking, teenagers.\n\nIn this case I can really say that I would probably had enjoyed this movie far better if it had less story in it. I say this only because it has such an horribly written story in it. It's the sort of story that actually works out confusing, due to the way how badly written and constructed it is. Basically you could say that it has 3 different story lines in it, that don't really ever come together well. This is what makes the movie so needlessly 'complicated' and also quite annoying. And it's not like any of the story lines is written well or interesting enough. The character's are all very lame ones and the movie doesn't even have a good or likable main character in it. No hero and no real villain in this one. Just a bunch of blood sucking lesbians doing- and shaking their thing.\n\nSounds like plenty of reason for some people to go and watch this movie but no, this movie is just a failure and disappointing at everything it wants to achieve. It's not directed and made well enough to even consider this somewhat remotely of a must-see for the lovers of the genre.\n\nTo be honest, it's not the worst erotic lesbian vampire movie (is this an official sub-genre yet?) I have ever seen but I still can't think of any reason why anyone should ever get some enjoyment or 'psychical pleasure' out of this production.\n\n3/10 \n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",
