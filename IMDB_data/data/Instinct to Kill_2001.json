The cast, directing, storyline, and all other movie-making essentials were SUPERB- PERIOD!\n\nGiven the choice to view the CRITICALLY acclaimed movies \"Titanic\", \"Star Wars\", \"Austin Powers\" and \"Harry Potter\" (consecutively and for free), or PAY to see \"INSTINCT TO KILL\", I'd pay to see the latter EVERYDAY of the week! HONESTLY!\n\nBy-the-way, in America's educational system we're taught A's are better than B's. Keeping this (nationally accepted 'Institution for Higher Learning' fact) in mind, why on earth are \"INSTINCT TO KILL\"'s cast members B-Labeled?, while the cast members of the other aforementioned movies are A-Labeled?\n\nPLEASE! Give me \"INSTINCT TO KILL\"'s (UNDULY B-Labeled) cast and you can keep your (SO CALLED) A-List wannabes!"
