When my Boss bought me the entire collection of this series online. I enjoyed it, it was the best,and very killer. I do like Momosuke,and the 3 outlaws. But what this show kinda tells us is stories are the most things people like to tell. We are want to write stories,and come up with ideas that would tell an interesting story. The series also features the great voice talents of:Grant George,Steve Kramer,Michael McConnohie (famous for Transformers,and others),and Mia Brady,and others. So if you plan to see this series,be careful when watching it. It can mess with your head.",
