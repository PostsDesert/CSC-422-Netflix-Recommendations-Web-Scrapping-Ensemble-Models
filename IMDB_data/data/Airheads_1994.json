But as far as 1990s comedies go, or films connected to \"Saturday Night Live\" (this one very loosely), this ranks up there in entertainment value.\n\nIf nothing else, the cast sells this -- David Arquette and Michael Richards before their prime. Adam Sandler at his peak. Brendan Fraser in a transition from Pauly Shore to \"real\" films... and Steve Buscemi? This is just loaded with talent.\n\nThe music will not appeal to everyone. Even as a fan of metal, I have to say a lot of the music is not as top-notch as it probably should be.",
