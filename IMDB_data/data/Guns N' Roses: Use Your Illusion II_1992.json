The first artist to win the Michael Jackson's MTV Awards (the golden moon man!) And this concert shows that the stage is where they feel more comfortable. The track-list is amazing, check it out:\n\n1- You Could Be Mine 2- Drum and Guitar Solo 3- Theme from \"The Godfather\" 4- Sweet Child Of Mine 5- So Fine 6- Rocket Queen 7- Move To The City 8- Knockin' On Heaven's Door 9- Estranged 10- Paradise City (introducted by 'Mother' from Pink Floyd) \n\nAxl was on top!!! the whole band was a hit!!! The Tokio Dome totally full, about 20.000 Japanese having the pleasure of attend a collection of songs that now make part of the Rock 'N Roll history!!!!\n\nJust for reminder, there are 2 volumes, the other one is great too!!!",
