        "reviewBody": "Last Resort features a capable comic cast but it really makes the sesnses whirl at times. It starts off as a family comedy and then starts throwing in lots of sex-oriented humor along with some real lame jokes and offensive stereotypes. One gets the feeling they sort of made up the story as they went along. It does have some laughs and some surprises but don't expect any sort of coherent story line. Chances are the better known cast members aren't too proud of this one.",
