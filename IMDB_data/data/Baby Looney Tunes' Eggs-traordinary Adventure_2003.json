I hope cartoon Network sees the ratings and take off this terrible excuse for a show. Bugs was so fun to watch in the original series. Here he's an unlikeable bastard who tries too hard to be perfect & has annoying voice. Daffy and Sylvester have become TOTAL IDIOTS! Taz went from a fearful creature to a copy of Mr. Sunshine (the one from CatDog, remember) Tweety is the only likable character in this show, but do they have to alter his voice to sound younger?! ALL the villains (Taz and Sylvester) have become unlikeable in this bland spin-off. And there's this Taz, You Like it episode that should BE BANNED! My Score is 1/10 this still sucks PS, this quote will explain it all \"I don't hate Baby Looney Tunes because it's nothing like the original. I hate it because it's painfully unfunny\"",
