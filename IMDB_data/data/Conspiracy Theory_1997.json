The only thing I disliked was the fact that Patrick Stewart didn't have a bigger role...\n\nThe movie also has quite some funny moments and lots of action. This definately is one of Richard Donner's best films to date, due especially to the outstanding performance of Mel Gibson! If you haven't seen it yet and if you're looking for an intelligent, well-acted movie, this is the one!"
