        "reviewBody": "An interesting, beautifully shot film that takes place on the English seacoast. The story concerns a widow who meets and falls in love with an American sailor, much to the dismay of her intelligent son. This marked the directing debut of playwright Lewis John Carlino, who went on to direct THE GREAT SANTINI and the vastly underrated CLASS. Here he shows great promise for a first-timer. His shots are detailed without being show-offy. He takes his time telling the story, but it's never boring. The characters are well-drawn, especially the club leader that the widow's son belongs to. In fact, the actors who play the boys are more interesting than Sarah Miles and Kris Kristofferson, who play the lovers. The love scenes are erotic without being overly explicit, and there is a strange ending. Try to see the letterboxed version."
