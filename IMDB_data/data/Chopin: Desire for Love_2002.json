Yes, it is the same movie. The title is the same, the casts are the same, the plot is the same.\n\nThis is the second movie I've watched this year about a Polish Pianist. The first one was Roman Polanski's The Pianist (stars Adrien Brody).\n\nThe world-renown cellist Yo-Yo Ma, pianists Emanuel Ax, Yokio Yokoyama, and Janusz Olejniczak, and violinists Pamela Frank and Vadim Brodsky use their talents brilliantly to bring Chopin's music to life.\n\nI guess I do enjoy this type of movies. Most would find watching these type of movies boring but I tend to enjoy them. :)",
