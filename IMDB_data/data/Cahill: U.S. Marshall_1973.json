When Cahill returns and ends up arresting innocent men, it sends the two youths scrambling to do the right thing.\n\nThough one of Wayne's later, less acclaimed movies, there's still a whole lot of fun to be had in this well produced, action filled morality tale.\n\nKennedy is in truly fine form here as a truly vile bad guy, while Neville Brand, who's usually typecast as despicable villains and psychopathic cretins, delivers a standout, heroic performance as Wayne's halfbreed sidekick.\n\nThe tense, bloody climax is pretty good.",
