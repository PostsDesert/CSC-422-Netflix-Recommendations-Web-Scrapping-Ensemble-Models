        "reviewBody": "This film is one of the best films I have seen. It presents Lesbians as independent and confident, as well as doing away with the usual stereo types. Go Fish shows that lesbians are human too, dealing with topics such as love, parents, relationships and sex, it gives insight into a world that most people don't believe exists. Rose Troche's directing is amazing, giving a real image of lesbian life instead of a Hollywood idea. As far as I am concerned, Rose Troche is one of the best directors of our time and Guinevere Turner is an amazing and beautiful actress. Keep it up girls!!!!!!"
