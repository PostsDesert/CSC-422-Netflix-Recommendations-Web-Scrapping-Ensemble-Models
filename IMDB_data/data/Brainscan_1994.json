        "reviewBody": "Brainscan is a fun, shocking, and enjoyable horror film that is one of the most underrated films around. Edward (T2) Furlong stars a troubled teen named Michael who loves horror movies and horror video games. His dad is never around and his mom died when he was a kid. He also likes to spy on his school-mate neighbor as she gets dressed. One day he gets a game disc in the mail for a new virtual reality game called Brainscan. A game in which you commit murders. But Michael soon finds a severed foot in his freezer and all hell breaks loose. Especially when the creepy and bizarre Trickster appears...guiding him to certain terror. This film was a pleasant surprised that had a charm about it. Furlong is believable as the troubled teen and turns in a great performance and T. Ryder Smith is both disturbing and cool as the evil demon behind the video game. Trickster easily steals the show. There is some good deaths and some decent gore. You get some T&A, a lot of hard rock music, a nosey detective, horror movie references, and some solid special effects. The movie seems to fly by and the end is a real treat. A solid horror rental for any horror fan. I have no idea why someone tried to compare this to \"In the mouth of madness\". Too bad the girl next door wasn't actually cute or attractive."
