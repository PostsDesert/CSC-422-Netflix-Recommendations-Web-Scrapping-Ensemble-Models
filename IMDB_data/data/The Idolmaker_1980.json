The supposedly really good ones would not get on HBO for 3 or 4 years.\n\nI just saw it again tonight, after 23 years, and I still enjoyed it. The music is great, the acting is great, and the plot is great.\n\nWhat is there not to like about it? I tried watching Chicago in 2002, the academy award winner, and it was a piece of crap. It was a combination Alfred Hitchcock/Showboat/Singing in the Rain movie, that was a total flop in my opinion. I much more enjoyed this movie.\n\nThere are a few slow points in the movie, but they don't last for long. There is such energy and vivacity in this movie that it holds your attention as it builds up continually to the next \"Idol.\"\n\nThe songs stick in your mind (at least in mine), but they are always \"in the wings\" of the Ray Sharkey character. For example, the first idol he made, Sharkey is shown off stage mimicking the singer's moves.\n\nAnyway, it is a fun movie to watch, and one of a kind for its time, so I highly recommend it!",
