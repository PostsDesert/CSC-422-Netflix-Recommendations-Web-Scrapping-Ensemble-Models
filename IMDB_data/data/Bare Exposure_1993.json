If this had been made back in the 1980's during the heyday of the Teen Sex Comedies, I MIGHT have made some allowances for how bad this was. But today, there is no excuse. I mainly rented this because Ashley Rhey is in it, and she's quite pretty, but if one word could sum of this film, it is \"lame.\" Whoever thought nudity could be so dull? There was no life in the acting, photography, ANYTHING! I've seen a lot of bad films and still managed to find some enjoyment in most of them, but this to me was a total waste. If you want a teen sex comedy with some spark, rent \"Rosebud Beach Hotel.\"",
