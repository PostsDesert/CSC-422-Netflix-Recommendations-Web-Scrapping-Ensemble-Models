        "reviewBody": "When the Russell family invests all their savings and move to a huge old house, their young daughter Gina (Sofia Vassilieva) claims to have some small new friends, The Huldre, living in the doll house in the yard. Her reluctant mother believes it is fruit of Gina's imagination, but finally she accepts the advice of the schoolteacher and takes the girl to the psychiatrist Dr. Werner (Malcom McDowell). In the end, the family realizes that there are many Trolls living nearby their house. \"Inhabited\" is almost a good movie. The story has a good atmosphere, but the effects of the monsters are very poor and the conclusion of the plot is not good. In the end, \"Inhabited\" is nothing but a conventional horror B-movie of haunted house. One of the best movies about Trolls that I have seen is \"Cat's Eye (1985)\", in the module with a young Drew Barrymore. My vote is six.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"A Casa Do Medo\" (\"The House of the Fear\")",
