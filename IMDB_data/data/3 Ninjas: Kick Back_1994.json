I will always make time to see this film. It is a great family show, kids, and adults will not have to be bored watching it. There is plenty of action. The boys have a grandfather that teaches them how to protect themselves and all about the heritage of the Ninja.The boys love their grandfather, and manage to get into trouble, but get out of it too because of what they learned from the grandfather. They love being with him, and enjoy his company. If you liked home alone then you will love this movie too. There is non stop action, and fight scenes geared to the family, no bad language, but loads of laughs as they beat up on the bad guys. Entertainment and fun. You cannot beat that combination!",
