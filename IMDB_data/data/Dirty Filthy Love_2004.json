        "name": "This film offers a fairly realistic view of OCD and Tourettes",
        "reviewBody": "\"Dirty, Filthy Love\" certainly serves the OCD and Tourettes suffering community well. It may be exaggerated with the coprolalia (ie, spontaneous swearing), but most people think that is what Tourettes is, anyway. I recommend this film. Other films that also help include: \"The Tic Code\", \"Maze\" and \"Matchstick Men\". In each case, the actors provide some dimension of reality to the afflictions. More humorous renditions include Jack Nicholson (\"As Good as it Gets\") and the television show \"Monk\" (Tony Shaloub). A primary value is helping the sufferer to explain the condition to others (read: family), which is hard for many people to understand. The educational value alone makes all these efforts worth while. I applaud the actors, directors, cast and crew of all these films."
