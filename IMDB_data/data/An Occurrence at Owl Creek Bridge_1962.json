        "reviewBody": "I'm curious: What happened to this film? I know it was included on the A. Bierce collection w/ Campbell Scott. But, when I watched it I couldn't believe my eyes. Or ears. I saw a longer version of the film about a year ago. I was very excited to see it on the collection. But, I was so disappointed to see it all cut up. Thankfully the collection has it as a 'longer version'. But, the version on the DVD (the short one) just didn't have any heart or guts. Seemed like a cookie-cutter remake of the old version everyone calls \"The Twilight Zone\" version. I had a chance to meet some of the people who made this film in Virginia. That version sort of haunted me, but maybe that's because the man who played Payton Farqhar was sitting in the room with us. The screening room was jam packed full of viewers. Everyone jumped and gasped at various moments of the film- in unison, because the effects and visuals made them jump. I have always known how OC ends. But, the version I saw in VA made me forget about that. I guess I was \"convinced\" so much by the new version that disbelief really was suspended. Kind of like when you watch the latest \"Titanic\" film. Everyone knows the ship sinks... But, you were so drawn into the film, that you hoped they would escape, or somehow live. Same here. I would rate this film a little higher but the shortened version on the DVD really brings it down.",
