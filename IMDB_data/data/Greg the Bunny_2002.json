        "reviewBody": "Greg the Bunny is an old fashioned ensemble cast TV series that tickles the funny bone. Everyone who watches the series will immediately have a favorite character (mine is the delightfully slow turtle, Tardy). The show had (I use the past tense since this show was never given a shot to find an audience before FOX pulled the plug on it.) an interesting mix of likable (Greg, Jimmy and of course Tardy), misunderstood (Gil and Alison) and just downright strange (Count Blah and most of the fabricated Americans--puppets.) There are a few other human characters who get their time in the stoplight as well. What FOX screwed up was the irreverent nature of the show. Seeing shows like 'Arrested Development' and 'Malcolm in the Middle' on FOX that are boarder line tasteless at times, makes me wonder why they'd try to tone down a show like 'Greg the Bunny'. But they did. The first half of the series is great, then there is a steady decline as the show got whitewashed and sanitized. A wonderful highlight of the DVD set are the commentaries by the creators. At one time it was a passion but then they caved to other peoples whims and the show sank. The Tardy the Turtle mini movie, if you enjoy Tardy is great as well. I highly recommend this show to anybody who enjoys The Simpsons and most other FOX adult cartoons.",
