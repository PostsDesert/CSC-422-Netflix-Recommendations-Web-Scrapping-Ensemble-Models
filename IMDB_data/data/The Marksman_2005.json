Confusing initial attempt to set stage for world wide danger, continuity staff (if any used) were asleep at the switch. Army Ranger in tower would shoot out window with AK-47 and then the inside shot when he ducks from bullets had him holding a HK. One of the scientists when alive was a woman with long blond hair, all dead ones were men. Avoid at all costs!\n\nEven Snipes action scenes were not up to his usual standard. His 'stealthiness' in kicking the Rangers' butts during the training mission consisted of him running through the woods at night and they just couldn't see him. Then later he outruns a jeep with a guy firing a mounted machine gun at him. Stinko!",
