        "reviewBody": "Aashiqui Review :\n\nOriginally planned as a video film, director Mahesh Bhatt convinced Gulshan Kumar to make Aashiqui a musical love story fit for a theatrical viewing.\n\nIntroducing Rahul Roy and Anu Agarwal as lovers who battle through the odds, Aashiqui was reportedly inspired from Mahesh Bhatt's own romance with his first wife Lorraine Bright (Pooja Bhatt's mom).\n\nOf course, the real stars of the film were music directors Nadeem Shravan who composed outstanding score; every song more melodious than the other.\n\n\"Bas ek sanam chahiye Aashiqui ke liye\" \"Ab ter bin jee Lange hum\" \"Nazar ke saamne jigar ke paas\" \"Main duniya bhoola doonga\" \"Dheere dheere se meri zindagi mein aana\".\n\nAashiqui created a new record for audio cassette sale and T Series consolidated its position in the music industry with this album.\n\nThe film was special for its poster as well. Typically, debutantes dominate the posters of their first film so as to familiarize their face to the audience. Only a maverick like Mahesh Bhatt could think of hiding them under a coat. The curiosity factor worked in favour of the movie.\n\nI saw Aashiqui in its very first week on VHS. I loved it so much that I purchased the video cassette and saw it multiple times. My theatrical viewing was much later at Paradise cinema, Mahim where it released in its 50th week. I enjoyed it just as much there..\n\nRegards",
