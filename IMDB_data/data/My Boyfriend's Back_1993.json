        "reviewBody": "* My Boyfriend's Back * has good production quality and a great cast of well-known actors. Of course, I'm bias cause I drool over Traci Lind. She's a hottie and a fine actress too. I loved her in *Class of 1999* and *Fright Night 2*. I really liked her in this film, though. This is a very witty, fun film to watch. No, it's not a * Titanic * or a * Gladiator *, but it is one of the best of its kind - campy, lighthearted family fun.\n\nIt's in the vein of films like * Back to School *, * Just One of the Guys *. . .\n\nIf you are looking for a film with good humor entertainment then I recommend this one!"
