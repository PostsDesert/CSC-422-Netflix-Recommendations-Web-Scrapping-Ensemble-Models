        "reviewBody": "It is true that the way this movie was shot it did seem similar to the Billy Crstal and Meg Ryan romantic comedy. But everyone forgets that Hollywood rips everything off all the time. This film manages to keep the watcher interested and makes you feel for it's characters.\n\nAshton Kutcher is usually very unwatchable, but in this picture he helps create a shy and ambitious lead in Oliver Martin. Oliver is a dreamer who puts all his energy in creating a internet company to sell diapers. Then there's the always animated Amanda Peet as Emily. Emily from early on tries to push Oliver to explore life. Ashton and Amanda make a great team on camera and also have great chemistry when it comes to the more emotional parts of the movie.\n\nOverall \"A Lot Like Love\" is a great romantic comedy with real heart and is really worth watching.",
