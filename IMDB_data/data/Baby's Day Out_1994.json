        "reviewBody": "...but I really love this movie! It's a pity this was released on the coattails of \"Home Alone\", since it's inevitably perceived as a knock-off. But the comparison is really unfair. \"Home Alone\" featured McCauley Culkin as annoying, precocious, and self-sufficient far beyond his years. The criminals who were his foils were reminiscent of The Three Stooges in their ineptitude. The one quality both Culkin and the criminals shared was a being mean spirited to some degree.\n\nBaby Bink in \"Baby's Day Out\" is a true innocent who survives on luck while remaining adorably unaffected. His criminal foils are more reminiscent of Laurel & Hardy than The Three Stooges - cleverer and more subtle. In this case, the quality shared by Baby Bink and the criminals is innocence and an underlying decency.\n\nThe supporting cast is superb, led by Joe Mantegna in one of his best comic roles.\n\nIf you're not too jaded to appreciate it, I highly recommend this movie.",
