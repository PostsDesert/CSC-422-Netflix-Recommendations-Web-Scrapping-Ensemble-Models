        "reviewBody": "I have recently seen the movie \"Cruel Intentions,\" and let me say it is one of the best films I've seen in a long while. As a big movie buff, I always see the latest movies on opening night, but I got a chance to see this one months before it will be released. Sarah Michelle Gellar is a stunning actress, and portrays Kathryn extremely well. Her character is evil and cunning, and is delivered with such grace and perfection... Ryan Phillippe is excellent as well, and he portrays Sebastian Valmont with as much talent as the lovely Ms. Gellar. They work very well together, as they did in their last movie together, \"I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER\"\n\nReese Witherspoon gives a nice performance as well, and Selma Blair's acting is worthy of as much recognition as Ms. Gellar's.\n\nAnyway, I should stop ranting about the cast... the story is a great update of \"Dangerous Liaisons,\" with a perfect mix of satire, wit, and drama. Writer Roger Kumble certainly has a sick sense of humor, and I applaud him for that. This is the most beautiful, wicked film since \"Wild Things,\" and though that may not impress some people, oh well. I thought it was incredible."
