Beside him even Snipes shows up some acting abilities.\n\n The story is, honestly, nothing special, even unlogical from time to time, but nevertheless it got something inside, maybe this eastern touch that keeps viewer glued to his seat. If then movie would be little deeper (like Blade runner for instance) it would be surely a classic. But despite that and mostly because of great performance by Connery it deserves a strong\n\n 8 out of 10.",
