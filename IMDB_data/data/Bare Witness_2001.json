Then I run them through this data base.\n\nGee...almost all of them received good reviews.\n\nNow...most of my all time favourite movies are outside The Hollywood Hype Machine....Tombstone, Heat (with Burt Reynolds), Something Wild, Searching for Bobby Fisher, The Wanderers.....so I'm always looking for something a little different.\n\nHmm...two good reviews for Bare Witness. Really? Oh hell...why not?\n\nI quickly discovered many why nots. What was the lousiest part of the movie? Script, acting, soft core porn scenes? All of the above.\n\nWhoever reviewed this movie before me must have had something to do with writing the script."
