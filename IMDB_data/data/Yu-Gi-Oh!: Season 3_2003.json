        "reviewBody": "This series hasn't really began to take off yet, but I must say the first episode very much impressed me.\n\nI hate to say this, but I honestly do think Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abridged Series is finally starting to lose its edge. What used to be a fantastically funny series with jokes worthy of Monty Python has now become merely another comedy show. Why? Mainly because the series now rely on recycled jokes from past episodes and pop culture references. And the new voice actors really don't help.\n\nBut the Pilot episode of this recent series is a fresh new start. I laughed several times from some fantastically timed gags, and even some pop culture references made me laugh they were so well done. All the characters have the same lovable personalities that they did in YGO: TAS.\n\nI really hope this show doesn't fade away like Cr@psule Monsters did. I want LK to make more of these. But if he's going to continue making YGO: TAS episodes (at a surprisingly slow pace, mind you) then I recommend getting rid of the voice actors and stop reusing jokes. The series isn't what it used to be, but that doesn't mean it can't change its ways.",
