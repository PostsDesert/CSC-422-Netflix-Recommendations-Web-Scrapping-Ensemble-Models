It looks like someone said, \"Hey! What if we made a movie about these two guys?\"\n\nIt tries way too hard to manipulate our emotions and make us \"feel\" the pain of the protagonists, but the only thing I felt was discomfort and irritation. Might work for some people, but did not work for me, not for one minute.",
