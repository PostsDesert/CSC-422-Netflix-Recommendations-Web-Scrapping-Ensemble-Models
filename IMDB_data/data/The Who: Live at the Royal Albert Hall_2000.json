        "reviewBody": "Features: Sometimes ferocious treatments of band classics, comparatively brief acoustic interlude and multiple guest spots.\n\nMerits: Best parts will be a thrill for longtime fans, providing a taste of the old glory - powerful, interesting and varied, including active use of the rim of the drum kit, Starkey in particular appearing to push himself on this night. But all are good. Nice shots of venue - which looks appealing - and effective close-ups. Extended base solo. On-stage banter.\n\nLimitations: Three-song acoustic interlude, although competently executed (at least during first two numbers with Pete by himself) amounts primarily to an interruption. One or two other portions with the full band also drag a bit. Most guest appearances come off as intrusive, the other musicians appearing out of their element. Floodlights sometimes block out all or part of the band at key moments. Missed close-ups. Extended base solo. On-stage banter.",
