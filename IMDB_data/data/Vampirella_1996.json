The acting probably isn't the best in the world, the costuming is at times camp (though who are we to complain about a babe running around in a bikini with a golden bat drawing our attention to her crotch -- when it isn't focussed on her ample cleavage or her gorgeous eyes? Oddly, the guys in the film don't seem to notice this), only it was the special effects that first set us off as the guns started shooting -- or whatever it was those guns were meant to be doing.\n\nThe script, well...we don't get _MST3K_ in this country so I don't know if _Vampirella_ has been given that treatment. No matter: Without straining our brains we were doing a good job of supplying our own commentary as this film sets itself up for that constantly. Though _Vampirella_ simply doesn't need the witty comments for you to end up rolling on the floor do add them; the audience participation really adds to the enjoyment. Get your mates around, pop the tape in the player, and let the hilarity ensue."
