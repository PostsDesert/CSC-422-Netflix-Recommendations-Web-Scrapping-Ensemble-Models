        "reviewBody": "Documentary of the 1994 senatorial campaign for the Virginia senate seat with a resurgent, from the Iran-Contra hearings, Ollie North running on the both Republican as well as Family Value ticket against former governor Chuck Robb the man as he called himself who never told a lie in his entire life. Both candidates had enough skeletons in their closets to fill Arlington Cementery but it was North who was the front runner in this race in his being involved in sending money as well as a birthday cake to the Ayatolla Khomeini regime in Iran-In return for arms to the Nicaraguan \"Freedom Fighting\" Contras- that at the time held dozens of US citizens,mostly working for the CIA,hostage. North was the point man in this sleazy undercover operation with the US practically in a state of war with Iran and that had him dubbed not as Ollie but \"Muhammad Ollie\" North by many Americans in and out of the US media.\n\nNow seven years later Ollie seemed to have cleaned up his act with all charges of lying to the US Congress dropped , on a minor technicality, from his record he seemed to be well on his way to become a members of the US Senate with only the dull as dishwater Chuck Robb blocking him. Robb himself was anything but a perfect candidate he was accused of being involved in both sex and drug parties with former Playmate & beauty queen Tai Collins who he claimed he had no knowledge of, he said he was drunk or high on pot at the time, and that Tai only gave him, while completely undressed ,just an innocent massage.\n\nAs the campaign went into it's final week Robb well behind Ollie got the support of the former Afracan/American-Who looks even whiter then Robert Redford-Virginia governor Douglas \"Wild Man\" Wilder who up until then had nothing but sheer contempt for him. The death blow on Ollie North's run for the senate was when former President Ronald Reagan's wife Nancy not only came out to endorse Robb but calling the All-American & Family Value Ollie a bold face liar. That's what finally turned the tide in Robb's favor. As the vote came in Robb took the lead and held it getting 45.6% of the vote to Ollie's 42.9%. It wasn't Robb's sparkling personality family values and honesty, no one really believed a word that he said, that got him elected but Ollie's checkered past. in his involvement in the drug and gun running between Iran and the Nicaraguan Contra \"Freedom Fighters\" that in the end finally finished him off.",
