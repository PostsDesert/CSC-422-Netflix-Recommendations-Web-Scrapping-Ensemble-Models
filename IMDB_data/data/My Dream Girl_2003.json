        "reviewBody": "This film borrows liberally from \"Pygmalion\" and \"My Fair Lady\", which are much better. The story is a automaker tycoon has a daughter who lives in the slums and re-claims her. He hires an image consultant (Ekin Cheng) from Hong Kong, so she can fit into Shanghai society. The pretty even when dirty Vicky Zhao plays Ning, who lacks in social graces. Strictly, this is a by the numbers romantic comedy. Vicky Zhao cannot and doesn't even try to touch Audrey Hepburn (thats next to impossible anyway), but I'm giving it a possible see for anyone who likes romantic comedies. The film is just over 90 minutes and it looks nice, so its not horrible, just not very essential. If you're a serious moviegoer you can skip this film.",
