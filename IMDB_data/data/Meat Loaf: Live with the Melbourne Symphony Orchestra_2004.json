        "reviewBody": "Meatloaf with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra is a definite top shelf rock music DVD. The big man belts out the classics and proves yet again that he doesn't just do music - he IS music.. and it comes from every pore as he delivers all the best hits from 30 years of rocking. Its obvious from this DVD that its the audience, not Meatloaf, who is in danger of not keeping up.\n\nThe Neverland Express is at full pace with Paul, Randy, and Kasim working like hyena's on the guitars while Mark lights up everything with keys on it. C.C. keeps the band (and the choirboys) hot while Patti Russo partners the big man with splendid animation and spectacular voice.\n\nKeith Levinsen leads the orchestra which fills out the already big tracks,. Watch for the best brown-eyed girl you ever saw playing a cello, and check out the percussionist guy who gets a solid workout to Steinmans music.\n\nI attended the Melbourne concert and am well qualified to say that this DVD is an essential keepsake for everyone who went and compulsory viewing for all those who couldn't make it on the night.\n\nSit close to the screen and play it loud for best results !",
