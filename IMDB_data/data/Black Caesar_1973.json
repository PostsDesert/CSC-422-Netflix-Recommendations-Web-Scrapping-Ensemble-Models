        "reviewBody": "Having grown up in extreme poverty in New York City and seeing firsthand the corruption, racism and criminal activity of those in law enforcement, \"Tommy Gibbs\" (Fred Williamson) decides that he wants to rise to the top and doesn't care what it takes. So he murders a mobster in cold blood to ingratiate himself with a rival kingpin and for this is allowed to set up his own small operation in an unprofitable part of Harlem. What follows is a steady rise to power helped in great measure by his obtaining some ledgers which list all of the corrupt politicians and the payments made to them under the table. Now, as far as a \"blaxploitation film\" is concerned this one wasn't too bad. Fred Williamson performed decently enough but my main concern was that it seemed like the sum didn't equal the parts. To be more specific, there were some very good scenes but they weren't connected very well. All in all then it wasn't a bad film and those who enjoy movies in this genre might like this one too. I rate it as average.",
