The viewer is hoping for the best and won't know until the very end of the movie. There were two endings made to this movie - one is sad and the other is happy. It all depends on what the doctor does when he comes out at the end. Watch to find out! It is a sweet movie of love and romance that'll leave the viewer in a teary suspense.",
