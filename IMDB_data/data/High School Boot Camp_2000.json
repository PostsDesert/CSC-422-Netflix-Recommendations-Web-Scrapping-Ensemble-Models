        "reviewBody": "50 boys (aged 13-18) are headed to a boot camp in Florida to try and clean up their lives. Witness these street punks turn into fine young men and hear the boys comment on everything from the constant yelling of the drill sargeants to the compliments on how the Eagles Academy changed their lives completely. A definite must see. There's very sad moments yet very happy moments. The boys must not only learn to change their lives but to believe in themselves which proved wasn't easy at times. Great documentary!! Just the respect the young men gain while spending 5 months in this academy is amazing. Watch how drill sargents become friends and how the families of these boys experience the change for the first time.",
