I knew that \"Orphans\" is the first directorial debut of Mullan.\n\nThe entire film has been brilliantly directed.The story of the movie in short: four brother and sister gather at a stormy night for their mother's funeral.As they gather, their love, hate, grief, for each other are expressed individually in that brilliant drama.\n\nThe entire cast and music are nice. actually, i like Stevenson's acting as \"Sheila\". She is brilliant.\n\nCongratulation Mullan to direct such a brilliant drama!\n\nI would like to rate this movie : 8 out of 10.",
