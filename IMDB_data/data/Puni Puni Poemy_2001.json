I personally didn't like it, but that's not to say other people will. This anime is wacky, random, over the top, and just plain weird. They break the fourth wall a lot, so the creators are aware of what they made is absolutely absurd, which is good to know. I'd be scared if they thought otherwise. So yeah, I didn't like it simply because I don't enjoy those qualities, at least not the amount found in this anime. If any of those qualities sound appealing to you, then I cannot recommend this more. It will not disappoint, as long as you like this kind of anime.",
