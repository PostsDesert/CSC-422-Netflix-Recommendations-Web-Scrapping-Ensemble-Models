However, although she didn't feature in it as much as I would have liked, Rachel Griffiths provided a fairly compelling performance which kept me happy throughout the rest of the movie.\n\n I was a little disappointed by all the characters EXCEPT Pamela though, and I'm afraid not even the girl who played Stacey can sway me on that. I felt that they were all very 2D. \n\nI am glad I've seen the movie (if only to get a glimpse of Christine in such AWFUL tights) but I'm also glad I didn't have to pay any more than Â£4.99 for it."
