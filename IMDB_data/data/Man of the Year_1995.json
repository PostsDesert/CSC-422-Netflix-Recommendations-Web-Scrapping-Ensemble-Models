(\"Best in Show\", \"A Mighty Wind\"), yet interestingly, it was made before all the ones I can think of except \"Spinal Tap\". And to my mind, it is just as good, if not better than the others. \"Man of the Year\" is based on Dirk Shafer's experiences as a Playgirl model--personally, I'd love to know just how much of the movie was based on real events; the movie is so skillfully done, it's difficult to tell. It has a subtle, intelligent humor all its own, and is, at times, quite touching (something other mockumentaries never get near).\n\nA fine piece of movie-making, well worth watching."
