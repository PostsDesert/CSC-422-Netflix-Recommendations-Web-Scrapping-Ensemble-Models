This is as good as the early seasons of 24 in my opinion whilst being very different in tone as well as structure, plus a much more global narrative, also slightly reminiscent of Bourne in a few places I think. Two hugely likeable and believable leads, quite a few hugely likeable supporting characters/actors, not all of who make it through to where we are now, and some fabulous location work. What's not to like? I will be gutted if season 4 really is the last.",
