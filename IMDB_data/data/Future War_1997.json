        "reviewBody": "My local Wal-Mart has $5 DVD bins. While I worked there, I used to buy some. Sometimes you can find classics, hard to find comedies, and a bunch of action films you've never heard of (but more recently you can get the whole Rambo trilogy). Well, I decided to take risks on buying some of the films. A lot of them weren't that bad, and definitely worth the $5. Then I found \"Future War\"...it had super cool looking cyborg graphics on the cover...so I bought it. I like schlock films, but this is even beyond schlock. I've seen better dinosuars in silent films, and for 1995, these dinos don't even hold up to them let alone \"Jurassic Park\" (of which they used raptors...very bad raptors in Future War). The cyborgs are push overs, and I can't even think of any worse looking cyborgs to compare them with! The story is also a bit funky. The woman who finds the escaped slave is an ex-gang member/drug person who's becoming a nun. Teamed up with her old friends and making an alliance between the local gangs (nuns and gang members and druglords don't mix-I'm sorry, I just can't see it) to fight the cyborgs and their raptors (the raptors disintegrate after they die). The cover art looks cooler than anything in the film. If this film was made during the 1960s-1990, the effects could almost be forgiven-but 1995!! This film is negative schlock, schlock wouldn't even touch this film. Troma wouldn't even touch this film! Yet I have a feeling, that if somebody wanted to-they could remake this and turn it into a modern hit. Sure, you'd have to improve nearly everything-but it can be salvaged. If you watch this, then watch T2. You'll laugh that such a film was made 3 years after T2-or fully appreciate T2."
