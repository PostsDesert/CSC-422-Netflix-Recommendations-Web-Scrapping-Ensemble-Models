But really, this is a idiotic film, with an idiotic plot, that is only watchable when Ms. Beart is on screen. Yes, she can do with just a glance what most actresses need a few pages of dialog to convey. I can't recommend this boring, badly directed and badly everything film, except for Ms. Beart. She's the only reason why you should watch this film, but fast forward any part she's not in."
