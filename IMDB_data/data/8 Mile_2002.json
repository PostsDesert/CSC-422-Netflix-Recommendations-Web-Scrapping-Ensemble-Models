        "reviewBody": "This movie was amazing! I was pleasantly surprised! I wasn't an Eminem fan going into the movie but I'm certainly one now. Seeing how different things are on the 'other side of the tracks' was a big eye opener for me. I loved the script, the actors, the music - basically I loved everything all the way down to the lighting. It's got everything for everyone in it! Comedy, drama, action, fighting, guns, drugs, sex, and of course - Bunny Rabbit. I loved the movie. I laughed so hard I cried at times and then I just flat out cried at others. I would HIGHLY recommend it to everyone whether they are an Eminem fan or not. Do be careful trying to get into it though. We had to go to four different movie theaters before my 16-year-old friend could get in. They're checking I.D.'s on this one BIG time. Anyway - go see the movie! You'll love it! I swear on my grave it's the best movie that I've seen in a long time!",
