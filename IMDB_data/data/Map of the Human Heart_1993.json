        "reviewBody": "This film reflects its international pedigree. Canadian films are wonderful when viewed in their \"language\" and film syntax, kind of a cross between French & English & Australian films in caprice, intelligence, plot development, and subjects. \n\nAmerican movie goers and film watchers (and Reviewers here) find something missing or too over-the-top in Canadian projects, wherever they're financed. \"Snow Walker\" was good but not \"Hollywood.\" \"Battle of the Brave\" was good; not exactly Hollywood. \"Map of the Human Heart;\" very, very good in its own vernacular. Very good - and moving and thought-provoking, and so on ...\n\n\"Map...\" has a love scene that could have come from the mind & imagination of Spielberg. Though not long or overly explicit, it may be one of the most unique and remarkable and perfectly contextual in all of film. Beautiful. Watch and see, near, or in, the 3rd Act.\n\nAnnie Galipeau is young here, and good, and presages her role in \"Grey Owl\" with Pierce Brosnan.\n\nThanks MIRAMAX for putting money into risky, off-the-worn-sprocket-hole projects.",
