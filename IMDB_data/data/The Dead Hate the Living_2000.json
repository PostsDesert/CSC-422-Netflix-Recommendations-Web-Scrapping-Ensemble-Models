        "reviewBody": "Being the Bruce Campbell fan that I am, I consider that one of the greatest lines in cinematic history. This is a horror movie for horror fans by horror fans. The Dead Hate the Living is what low budget horror is all about. The zombies are original and extremely creepy. Gaunt, the huge 8 foot zombie, is incredibly eerie. The film's atmosphere is great too. The scene where Maggot pulls Marcus off my his entrails is awesome. There are two computer effects that I was not happy with, the electrocution and the zombie barbecue. Other than those minor flaws, this is certainly a step up for Full Moon Studios. Full Moon pictures has been in a slump for years. This is their best movie since Castle Freak. Actually, I can only recall them having four good movies: Castle Freak, The original PuppetMaster, Subspecies, and this one. The tributes (Sam Raimi, Lucio Fulci, George Romero, John Carpenter, and others) within the film are great too. If you are an underground horror fan, you should at least check this one out for those. This is a must see for all genre (especially zombie) fans. The Dead Hate the Living will turn into a cult classic within a few years. \"Glorious Megadeth!\""
