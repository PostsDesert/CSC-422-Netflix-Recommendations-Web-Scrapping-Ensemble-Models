For those of you who enjoyed this movie but have not read the book I would strongly encourage you to do so.\n\nFor those of you who have read the book and felt a little unsatisfied with the movie, I feel the same. Unless I missed it they left out Hanoi Jane's visit to the camp which is totally unacceptable. Also, McCain's theft of another persons washrag was not part of the movie.\n\nI'm glad a movie was made from this great book, but as is often the case, the movie is substantially inferior to the book.",
