        "reviewBody": "This movie borrows a great deal from F/911. It does do a nice job expanding upon the Florida voting sham/scam of the 2000 election. It's a shame these films did not receive their proper exposure prior to the 2004 election. The truth hurts, and sometimes I think Americans are guilty of avoiding the truth for the sake of convenience. Are we intellectually lazy as a society? Perhaps. Then again, maybe the \"red state\" values are different from the traditional \"blue state\".\n\nAnyhow, the film does give a special thanks to Michael Moore at the end, and it was great entertainment overall, however no where near the gem F/911 was.",
