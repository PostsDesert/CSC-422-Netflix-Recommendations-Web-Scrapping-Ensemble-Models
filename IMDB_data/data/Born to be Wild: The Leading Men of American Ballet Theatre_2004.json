        "reviewBody": "My mom got this DVDfrom PBS, I assumeand I borrowed it. My wife and I watch it over and over, 3 or 4 times so far at least. It sparkles with skill, grace, and fire. It takes you to the former Soviet Union, Cuba, Spain, and the Midwest to hear the dancers' teachers and loved ones talk about them and to see the environments in which they grew up and trained. It gives clips from old performances and the dancers' reminiscences. We also see them rehearsing a new dance made for the four of them, culminating at the end with a performance. I myself found the solos from classical ballet more exciting than the new dance, but perhaps that is just my conservative taste. They are all amazing dancers, and it is a real treat to experience such intense male energy, in four unique and individual expressions, all quite different from female dancers",
