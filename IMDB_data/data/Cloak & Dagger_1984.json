The script is much better quality than similar Marvel TV titles like AGENTS OF SHIELD, and it's practically a masterpiece compared to INHUMANS. Then again, INHUMANS looked like bad cosplay with a $20 budget.\n\nI'm surprised to find this on Freeform instead of regular ABC television, but whatever, the series looks like it has a bright future if the story quality stays at the same level.",
