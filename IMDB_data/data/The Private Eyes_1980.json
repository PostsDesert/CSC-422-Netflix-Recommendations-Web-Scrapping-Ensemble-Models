        "reviewBody": "Any movie that features Don Knotts as a brilliant detective and Tim Conway as his faithful assistant certainly has courage going for it.\n\nBut \"Private Eyes\" is better than you might expect; the setting (Biltmore Castle) is beautiful, the supporting cast (Fox in particular) is hilarious and a lot, if not all, of the gags are priceless. \n\nThen again, what would you expect from Knotts' above-it-all air of pseudo-intelligence and Conway's endless pratfalls and an overcoat full of pigeons (don't ask)? They're two of the old-school comedians who know what's funny and never try to go further than the jokes will go. \n\n \"Private Eyes\" works because Knotts and Conway are, more or less, just being themselves. Definitely a film worth seeking out.\n\nYou'll laugh. Trust me.\n\nSeven stars. And don't drink the ink.",
