        "reviewBody": "1 Giant Leap was nominated for two Academy Awards in 2003 and should have won. It is a unique creation specifically originally made in non-sequential chapters for DVD (ie not a plot-linear movie transferred to digital format). The music is stunning (world genre), and the visuals are exceptionally special. It is not a rehash of Baraka or Koyaanisquatsi but if you were impressed by either of them, and/or if you love world music, you need to see 1GL. It also carries some very interesting and pertinent comment on many political/philosophical themes. My only criticism is it's a bit over-respectful perhaps of specifically Hindi spirituality.",
