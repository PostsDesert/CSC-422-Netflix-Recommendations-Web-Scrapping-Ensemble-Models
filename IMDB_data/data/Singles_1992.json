What I liked about this movie is that all the single people know that they need \"someone\", which is the constant struggle that goes on in their lives, but finding that \"someone\" isn't as easy as we think it would be. This movie does a good job of showing this. It is well-written, funny, played out well by the stars and has a nice soundtrack to fill in the voids.\n\nIt's about \"people\" and it has a style like a chronicled life where the characters every once in a while talk to the camera as if their lives are being documented. Excellent effort by Crowe and his crew to bring this segment of society into view for all of us.",
