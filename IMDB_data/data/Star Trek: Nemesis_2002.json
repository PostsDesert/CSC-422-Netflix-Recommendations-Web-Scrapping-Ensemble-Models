        "reviewBody": "This apparently final flick of the TNG crew went unnoticed in the theaters, and I don't think Paramount invested heavily in either the movie itself or its promotion. Despite the many scathing reviews I found some quality in the movie. Many of what have been interpreted as ripoffs of previous scripts were deliberate nods to the series' high points, and if it wasn't clear enough the many cameo appearances should have given the hypercritical some pause. Many of the sets and scenes were well done, and Tom Hardy and bad guys did good. The weakest part of the movie is that there should have been more sense of the crews' closeness, principally through better dialog. Even Data doesn't have many good lines. It just doesn't have much of an edge to it. Even if they didn't get a huge budget for it better character interaction could have made this a much more memorable movie. Certainly not the worst Star Trek, its too bad that it couldn't have been a better movie to end the series.",
