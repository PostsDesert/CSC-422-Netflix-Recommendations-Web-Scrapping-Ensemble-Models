        "reviewBody": "I couldn't agree more with a post about this stand-up show, it was a nice one hour escapism, but rather unmemorable and plain. Richard Jeni even pointed out how he was going to p** off all kinds of people, but I can't imagine the jokes being more bland, especially considering the tabu stuff that he stuck his nose into. I've never seen Jeni perform before, so I can't possibly give an objective opinion on his stand-up routines, but he striked me as a comedian who has decent, if not even rather good jokes, but perhaps fails to realize their potential when he delivers them. Too monotone for my taste, but still better than average.\n\n7/10",
