        "reviewBody": "\"Boys Life 1\" and \"2\" are a collection of short movies dealing with gay youths. \"2\" actually contained an Oscar-winning short--\"Trevor\". This movie isn't as good as the first two, but occasionally works. It contains 5 shorts--\"Majorettes in Space\" comes first. It's a French film that juxtaposes gays, straights and the Pope in a very interesting way. Short and very well-done. Second is \"hiTCH\"--a very boring story about a young gay man and straight man on a road trip. Annoying direction and a pointless story. Third is the longest (27 min.) and called \"Inside Out\". It's about a young man (Jason Gould--son of Elliot and Barbra) dealing with being a celebrity's son and gay. Well-done with a few good lines and a nice cameo by Christina Crawford, but it lacks a specific point of view and is kind of dull. 4th--\"Just One Time\" is basically a promo for the feature film of the same name. Cute and quick. Last is \"$30\"--an excellent short about a prostitute (Sara Gilbert) and a closeted young man trying to lose his virginity. Predictable, but sweet and entertaining. Worth seeing for the first and last episodes. Hopefully, there will be a \"Boys Life 4\" with a better selection.",
