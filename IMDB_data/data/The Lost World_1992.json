After hearing Challenger's fantastic tale of possible living dinosaurs, Malone joins his expedition to the location of the title.\n\nLeading the team is Professor Summerlee (David Warner), a long-time skeptic of all things Challenger. Photographer, Jenny Nielson (Tamara Gorski) and an eager, 13 year old boy named Jim (Darren Peter Mercer) round out the group. They are also joined by a beautiful -No, seriously, this is one of the most breathtakingly gorgeous women ever filmed!- interpreter named Malu (Nathania Stanford). After an arduous journey through Zimbabwe, the mesa is reached, and the dino fun begins.\n\nThis movie is a nice, family-friendly update of the 1925 original. Rhys-Davies is his usual, awesome self, as is Warner. Oh, and Ms. Stanford has many scenes! The entire cast returns for the sequel..."
