        "reviewBody": "When \"Auntie Mame\" was first published, I read and re-read it (and its sequel, \"Around the World with Auntie Mame\") for several summers. Believe it or not, the books are even funnier than the film. They were not \"memoirs,\" though that was the PR at the time. Edward Everett Tanner, or \"Patrick Dennis,\" ultimately admitted as much. Auntie Mame was a creation from Tanner's own talented imagination.\n\nNo one ever has, or ever will, embody Auntie Mame as well as Rosalind Russell, who, by the time her Broadway performance in the role was filmed, had honed her portrayal to one of the finest in American theatre and film.\n\nListen to her vocal technique: from high girlish squeals to basso-profundo sarcasm.\n\nOr watch her remarkable body language throughout -- from grande dame theatricality to lowbrow burlesque.\n\nRussell's supporting players are magnificent -- from the 12-year old Jan Handzlik, through Coral Browne, Peggy Cass, Forrest Tucker, Fred Clark, Patrick Knowles, Connie Gilchrist, Yuki Shimoda, Robin Hughes, Roger Smith, Pippa Scott -- and, my own particular favorites who almost, but not quite, steal their scenes from Miss Russell: Willard Waterman, Lee Patrick and Joanna Barnes as the unforgettable Upsons.\n\nGeorge James Hopkins' brilliant sets and set design, and Orry-Kelly's amazing costumes, along with Branislau Kaper's score and Morton Da Costa's direction are like Tiffany settings, showing off this flawless cast at the top of their form.\n\nLawrence and Lee's original Broadway script was adapted by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, whose main contribution would appear to be the hydraulic furniture at the final dinner party.\n\nThe famous line, originally from the Broadway play and not found in the novel, is \"Life is a banquet! And most poor sons-of-bitches are starving to death!\" \"Damn\" and \"hell\" both are heard in the film: but \"sons-of-bitches\" was apparently too strong for the MPAA in 1958.\n\nIs the film dated? I suppose. In the same way that \"Citizen Kane\" is dated, or \"Some Like It Hot.\" It's also timeless. And Miss Russell's performance, here at the zenith of her long and distinguished comedic and dramatic career (Eugene O'Neill's \"Mourning Becomes Electra,\" anybody?) is an acting lesson unto itself.",
