Its \"The Goonies\" for the 90's, and, well...sure kicks butt compared to \"Home Alone.\" Did you cheer when he rolled down his own stairs in a sled? Not exactly. Of course who wouldn't cheer for three kids taking down a six-foot, two hundred-plus pounder henchman (who's really posing as a light-up dummy)? Even though slightly unintelligent...plot remains solid with sharp humor and on-your-feet fight scenes. Yet, its not exactly Bruce Lee...but did you ever see Bruce Lee kick butt at age 13? See the movie. It's definitely some high-kickin' fun."
