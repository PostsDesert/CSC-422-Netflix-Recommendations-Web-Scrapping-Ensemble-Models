It was funny! It's one of those films that if you live of have lived in Los Angeles, you can appreciate the humor. Kind of like Swingers (I saw Swingers when I lived in NY, and I didn't get the hype, then I saw it a few years later after moving to LA and I couldn't stop laughing).\n\nNot a masterpiece but if you're ever home on a rainy day and should happen to stumble across this one on cable, it's the worth the time.",
