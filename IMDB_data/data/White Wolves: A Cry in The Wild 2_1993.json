        "reviewBody": "When I was about 11 my mom bought this movie on VHS from a Christian/Family based movie salesperson that came to our door. This is one of the worst acted movies I have ever seen. However... that makes it entirely worth watching. It is hysterical. I'm particularly fond of the performances from the actors playing Cara and Jake's Girlfriend. They are AWFUL. I have seen this movie no less than 50 times and it just keeps getting funnier every time. I know that this wasn't the intent, yet now as a 26 year old I still have a special place in my heart for this flick. Watch it once just to see the creepy actress playing Jake's girlfriend delivering the line, \"There they are,\" from a rescue helicopter. Easily the worst acting in cinematic history. I need to invest in a DVD copy since my tape is worn out. Happy Laughing!",
