Warhol coined the word \"superstar,\" became one, and changed the way the culture looks at and understands celebrity.\n\nAlthough Warhol is a controversial figure in art history, I have always been drawn to his work and the people around him. As one person says in the film, he really defined the 1960s. I would agree. The art, the films, the personalities. So many people can be tied back to Warhol.\n\nYet, at under 90 minutes, this film feels incomplete. The inclusion of Dennis Hopper is great, but we could use more than an archive interview from Lou Reed. And where is Joe Dallesandro? It would be nice to see a longer cut of this film, maybe an anniversary edition or something.",
