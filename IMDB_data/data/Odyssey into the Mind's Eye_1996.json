After successfully surveying some of the best computer based animation in three wonderful volumes, they seem to slack off and go with imagery that has nothing new, and almost nothing worthwhile to offer. Some of it is nice. Some of it is neat to look at. None of it breaks the ground of offering high end imagery to the masses.\n\nThe music was also subpar in this edition. After being touched by the work of Jan Hammer, and being blown away by Thomas Dolby, they seemed to have the music take a back seat to an already mediocre offering.\n\nMy advice: Go back to The Gate to the Mind's Eye. There's more there worth experiencing.",
