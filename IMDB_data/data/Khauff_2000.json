Only thing is that 'The Juror' succeeded in being a dark thriller, whereas Khauff just proves to be your average masala flick. Loaded with colorful songs and silly comedians, we have some ugly villains in the mist, who looks more like drunk nightclub folks, more than men from the mafia.\n\nSanjay Dutt, the sinister villain, is the ONLY hitman who can sing, dance, dress like Calvin Klein, wear bright colors, romance and... fall in love.\n\nMaybe Sanjay Gupta should've seen The Professional, first, to get a feel of what a hitman is really like, rather than throwing his glamour-doll in the scene to scare us.\n\nSorry Mr.Gupta, but using scenes from Replacement Killers, The Juror & Endless John Woo films, and stealing music from Wild Things, Replacement Killers & Prince of Egypt (Yes, I noticed that one in the end, too) will get you nowhere as a director...\n\nInstead, you'll be better known as a DJ... the mixer of movies-n-music.",
