        "reviewBody": "Based on the muckraker Sinclair Lewis' novel, and superbly translated to the screen by Richard Brooks (In Cold Blood , The Professionals, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof), this story of huckster-ism by religion is a masterpiece.\n\nBurt Lancaster player the greatest role of his career, getting his only Oscar for his performance. Lancaster, so good in such films as From Here to Eternity, Atlantic City, and Seven Days in May, was spellbinding as the salesman for God.\n\nShirley Jones (The Music Man, \"The Patridge Family,\" was simply delicious as Gantry's first conquest, and now a \"five-buck hooker,\" that he left behind: \"Oh, he gave me special instructions back of the pulpit Christmas Eve. He got to howlin' \"Repent! Repent!\" and I got to moanin' \"Save me! Save me!\" and the first thing I know he rammed the fear of God into me so fast I never heard my old man's footsteps!\" 1960 was a great year for movies, and this was certainly one of the best of that year, and one of the best of all time. If you want to see real acting, this film should be on your \"must-see\" list.",
