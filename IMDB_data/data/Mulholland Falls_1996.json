        "reviewBody": "As a fan film noir, I loved the 1940s and '50s period atmosphere in this movie. This particular story takes place in the early 1950s. Parts of this reminded me of \"Chinatown,\" but this film doesn't have the impact of that one. It's just not as memorable.\n\nYou get an idea that this might be another cops-or government officials-are-a- little-over the top when you see who plays them: Nick Nolte, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Chazz Palminteri, Treat Williams, Bruce Dern, John Malkovich, Ed Lauter, Andrew McCarthy, etc. Those guys usually play crooks, not cops. Same with the women in here. Jennifer Connelly and Melanie Griffith aren't exactly Irene Dunne and Doris Day!\n\nWe also see CSI star William Petersen playing a Chicago mobster! Unbilled in this film were Louise Fletcher, of \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\" fame, and Rob Lowe.\n\nThis story is a rough-edged for my tastes, with the normal political agendas (government is bad.....again) thrown in here and there, but what I really liked - outside of the look, the \"whodunit\" angle and the deep cast, was Haskell Wexler's photography. He makes it fun to watch, even if it is no \"Chinatown\" or \"The Big Sleep.\"",
