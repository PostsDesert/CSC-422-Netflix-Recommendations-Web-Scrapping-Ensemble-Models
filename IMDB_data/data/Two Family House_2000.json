        "reviewBody": "I like many things about this movie, not the least is a cast of nearly unknowns. Being from the western US, the community of Staten Island was completely unknown to me and a departure from the New York I've seen in depicted in most movies. I found the story, while not startlingly original, well told and the characters mostly believable. I reluctantly have to admit that some characters -- especially the fifties housewives -- are more stereotypical than I would have liked, comporting with most east coast Italian coming of age movies we all have seen.\n\nI was delighted that the story stopped short of being maudlin while still telling a story with a moral about perseverance and risk taking. I think others will find the story to be believable and wonderful.",
