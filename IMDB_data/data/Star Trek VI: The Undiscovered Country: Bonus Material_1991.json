        "reviewBody": "This movie has it all, it has drama, action, special effects you name it. It also has a nice resolving conclusion to the Kirk era of Star Trek, the possibility of peace among Klingons and Humans.\n\nOn the technical side the directing is beautifully and masterfully done by Nicholas Meyer. Well edited movie. The director took careful consideration to keep you in suspense, for example, hiding the villain in the background of the light, things like that. The special effects, though not remarkable, as in The Wrath of Khan's in-your-face effects, the effects in this movie generally are good, the battle sequences in this movie are just as good as The Wrath of Khan one.\n\nAgain a nice motif is the scripts placement of Shakespeare quotes into the villain, just like Khan in Star Trek II. Speaking of the villain, Chang, here you see excellent acting thanks to the actor Christopher Plummer.\n\nThere are a lot of in-line jokes, which adds to that atmosphere of closeness between the characters. Sulu's transfer to a new ship, the Excelsior is sought here. The set construction and pieces are great. The new enterprise bridge looks more military like. The presidential office (may note it is a redone Ten Forward from St, the next generation), the peace talk location, etc.\n\nThe end of the movie has a sad feeling towards it, a teary farewell to the crew of the Enterprise, and a clear passing of the torch to the new crew.\n\nA great movie that you must see,\n\nRating: 9/10"
