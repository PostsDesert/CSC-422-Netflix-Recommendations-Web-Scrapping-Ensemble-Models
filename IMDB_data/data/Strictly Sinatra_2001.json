        "reviewBody": "There is something which, for me, is more compelling about films set in Europe which are made by filmmakers in their home areas. Even if Spielberg, Allen, Mamet or the like, from America, with all their talent and resources, make films in Great Britain, France, Spain, etc. - they never seem to gain the true \"feel\" of the locale as well as native producers and directors. As an example, absolutely nobody can evoke the true character and feel of Madrid and the rest of Spain like the great Amodóvar.\n\nAlthough this small film is hardly in the category of one of Amodóvar's, it provides a true \"feel\" for Scotland and Glasgow, including its often gray, dreary atmosphere, in the most authentic manner, making the amusing, light story even better.\n\nThe music is great, the acting and characters engaging, and somehow the characters seem both realistic and fanciful, sometimes simultaneously, a trick many larger films miss.\n\nAs a bonus, we also can now see where Mike Myers likely obtained the accent he employed for the \"Fat Bastard\" character in his Austin Powers work.",
