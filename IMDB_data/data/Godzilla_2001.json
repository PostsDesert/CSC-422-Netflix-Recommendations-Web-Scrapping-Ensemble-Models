        "reviewBody": "A crazy parody of the classic Godzilla series of films. Adam Black, obviously Caucasian, runs around Dallas in an attempt to save it from Godzilla (who rises from the depths of the oft-polluted Trinity River), until he discovers that his enemy might not be so bad. It's been dubbed over, presumably from gibberish to English, which gives the movie a nice sense of light-heartedness. Production values aren't very high, and some footage is obviously taken from other (older) Godzilla movies. But it all rests on the shoulders of leading man Adam Black, who fills the role quite well. The funniest aspect of his performance is that, in Black's performance, everything is taken seriously and with full (sometimes slightly exaggerated) gravity.\n\nThe concept of Godzilla tearing his way through Dallas, TX, along with a plethora of cheesy effects, makes this a moderately worthwhile watch for any fan of parody, but Black's performance also makes it a worthy tribute to the classic Godzilla films.\n\nOh, and it's a lot better than that OTHER American Godzilla movie!",
