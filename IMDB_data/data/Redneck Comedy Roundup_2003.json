This is not a great version of this particular material, but Ron's mediocre work is better than some people's best work.\n\nIt contains some work by members of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour and a couple of others who are real Pro's, but again, it is work from the early '90's when most of these people were still working out their material.\n\nAll in all, I'd say it's worth a look, but remember, the better performances on it, may come from some performers who were not even on the Blue Collar Tour.",
