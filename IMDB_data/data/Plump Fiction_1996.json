        "reviewBody": "I rented this one because I heard it was funny. I don't remember where I could have possibly heard that because it was anything but funny. I've seen all the movies it attempted to spoof and I understood all the \"jokes\". I was even amused at first, but that didn't last long. The pure and simple truth is that this movie was not funny. Not in the least. It was so bad, it reminded me of The Underground Comedy Movie. That was horrendous, too. I think I laughed at least once in that one, though. I didn't laugh at one joke or gag in this one. I did find it a tad clever at times, but not enough to make it anywhere near a good movie.\n\nThe worst of the worst was Sandra Bernhard. Man, she has to be the worst actress I've ever seen. She would give the girls in Savage Roses a run for their money for worst actress. It's pretty bad when you can't act well enough for a parody. I can't believe she's still getting work. Enough time wasted on her.\n\nIf I had to say something good about the movie, the only thing that stands out is Tommy Davidson. He can do a dead-on Samuel L. Jackson and he was the highlight of the movie. Not something to be proud of. It's a shame that Bernhard is still working and Davidson hasn't been around for a couple of years. \n\nIt is because of Tommy's performance that I would give this movie 2 stars out of 10 (instead of 1). Don't say you haven't been warned."
