The later film also concerns obsession getting close to madness but that one is a little easier to watch than this. Well enough made, with some beautiful shots and close-ups and good performances, this is pretty gruelling stuff. I found, even the early scenes where there is a lot of laughing and licking of each others fingers slightly uncomfortable and that's before we get onto flavouring their food with each others juices and ultimately, games involving the tying of a pink cloth around the neck. Nicely non linear, with jumps forward and the reveres with newspaper clippings and some historical detail, but it is still claustrophobic, being mainly set in one room, and always unsettling.",
