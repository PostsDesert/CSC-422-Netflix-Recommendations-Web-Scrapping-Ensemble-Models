I grew up with them and I still think they are quite entertaining and I can share them with my little girls. I wish more fans would rate these movies higher. Although I have noticed lower ratings for most movies nowadays. People are harsher with rating things as nothing is left to shock or surprise these days. I was a BIG fan of all Mary-Kate and Ashley stuff and was glad they put out more content for me to follow as they and I got older. I hope one day they'll both do one more movie or show for the fans to enjoy! That would be amazing!",
