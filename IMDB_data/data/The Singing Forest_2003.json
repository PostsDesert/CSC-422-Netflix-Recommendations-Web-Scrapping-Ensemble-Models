I agree with most all the negative comments about the directing, lousy sound, poor lighting, no action, etc. But, worst of all, our intelligence was insulted by an ignorant script which completely failed to deal with the basic story idea. It was so contrived that it should be named \"The Groaning Forest\". The actors did the best that could be expected with such a miserable script. I'm giving my copy to the local gay rights organization, with a warning \"See it with friends who can make bad jokes about this taaackkkky flick, then you may get some chuckles.\"",
