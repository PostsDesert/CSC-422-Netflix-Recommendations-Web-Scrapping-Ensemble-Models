So there I am at the salad bar at the Hollywood Sizzler, and who is next to me, but Richard Dreyfuss, hiding under a baseball cap.\n\nI had to write him a note, before this rare opportunity slipped away. \"Dear Mr. Dreyfuss, your performance in \"Inserts\" was worth an Oscar. You were brilliant. The whole cast was perfect. I loved the \"Cuban Gothic\" house. Thank you for taking such a professional risk. Bravo.\" Signed: An Admirer Paid a waitress $5 to take it over to him. He was with his wife and kids, with his back to the room. I then slipped out after he opened the folded note and read my words. Read what others who love film have written about this underground classic yet to be discovered? The whole cast went on to become big movie stars after making this little masterpiece. Bravo to the writer, cast and crew.",
