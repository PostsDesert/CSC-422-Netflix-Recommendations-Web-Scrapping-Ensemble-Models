        "reviewBody": "Out of 84 films at an independent film festival in Tampa during spring of 2004, this was my favorite. The humor was well thought through and laced in the movie. There were some truly hilarious moments, my favorite being when Nick and Joey see The Pretty Girl and Nick does a double take. The music and slow-motion just carry it perfectly. His other films at the festival (Friendland, Another Hit) were very smart also. Though his comedies (Winter Break, Friendland) were the best, his crime/drama Another Hit was good too, especially for a student film, it was better than most of the films at the fest, even the ones that had a large budget. I look forward to seeing more of Nick's work. \n\nA-",
