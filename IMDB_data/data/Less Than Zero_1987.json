Julian uses his daddy's money to start a record company. Blair abandons her plans for college with Clay and sleeps with Julian. Six months later, Julian returns home from college for Christmas. Blair convinces Clay to help Julian who is in trouble. Julian lost all of the money and had to borrow from drug dealing school acquaintance Rip (James Spader).\n\nThis captures a certain superficial 80s L.A. decadence. Robert Downey Jr. delivers a big-time performance as a druggie mess. It is probably a bit of real life imitating art. James Spader has the perfect creepy sleaziness. McCarthy is still in the full bloom of his boyish charm. His problem is that he's a bit inferior for the part. He's not quite the leading man this role calls for. Jami Gertz does functional girlfriend acting. Downey is the key and he's great.",
