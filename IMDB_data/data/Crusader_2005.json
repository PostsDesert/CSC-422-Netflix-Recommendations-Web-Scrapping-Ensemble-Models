        "reviewBody": "The thriller element is alright, but the script is one of the most laughably bad I've heard in a while. Some of the lines are real clunkers.\n\nThe odd combination of a couple Americans (McCarthy and Bo Derek) and a Brit (Michael York) in the main roles and a cast of Spaniards is incredibly unrealistic. Hokey, but still, kind of fun.\n\nThe opening scene is full of gratuitous violence. It was so full of death I almost stopped watching, but some people may find that cool.\n\nAndrew McCarthy looks thin and wizened. He really should pack on a few pounds. Bo Derek is surprisingly good considering she really isn't much of an actress.",
