        "reviewBody": "Phil Hartman may not have had the hype during his SNL career that Dana Carvey, Mike Myers, Chris Rock and Adam Sandler received, but he was easily their equal in talent and importance to the show's reputation in the '90s. As has been said before, he was as versatile and reliable as Dan Aykroyd was to an earlier era. It's not just the dead-on impersonations of Clinton, Donahue, Sinatra, etc. that are so funny, but maybe even more so the oddball original characters who can turn ordinary lines like \"This is something; this is nothing...\" or \"Oh, there's a little tear in the paper bag..\"into comic gems. I love this DVD just for Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer, which manages to simultaneously spoof primitive minds and legal weasels. \"Your world frightens and confuses me!\" We miss you, Phil.",
