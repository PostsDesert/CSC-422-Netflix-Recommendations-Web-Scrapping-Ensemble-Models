        "reviewBody": "Despite the electricity of \"The Odd Couple\" the emotional force of \"Lost in Yonkers\" and the Depression-era angst of \"Brighton Beach Memoirs,\" this remains the best movie made of a Neil Simon play. \n\nLike \"The Odd Couple\" it owes most of its enduring success to the chemistry between Jane Fonda and Robert Redford (reprising his role in the Broadway show) as the hapless newlyweds trying desperately to make it work. This is the movie that is responsible for most of the \"mismatched\" romantic comedies we've ever seen, including \"Along Came Polly\" and TV's \"Dharma and Greg.\" It proves that flowery romantic prose isn't what makes a great love story, bold heroes and damsels in distress don't make a good love story. No, what makes a good love story are two people who, from start to finish, makes the audience go \"Oh, God in heaven, please let them work it out!\"\n\nThe brilliant dialogue of Mr. Simon, the charm of Mr. Boyer and the majestic backdrop of New York City make this a must-see for anyone who loves 1, comedy, 2, love stories or 3, Robert Redford because after this, he never really made another movie that was at all comparable. \n\nOh, I just remembered \"Laughter on the 23rd Floor.\" I guess it's a tie for best Neil Simon movie."
