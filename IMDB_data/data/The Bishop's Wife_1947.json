        "reviewBody": "For those who have asked about the name of the music sung by the Mitchell Boychoir in this movie, it took years, but I finally ran it down. \n\nThe original piece is named NOEL, and it was composed by Charles Gounod (1818-1893)as a classical church piece. It is not a hymn at all (in the sense that Gregorian Chants aren't hymns), but was translated for film purposes from the original church music.\n\nIt can be ordered from AMAZON.COM, the entire title is \n\nCHARLES GOUNOD Musica sacra\n\nand it is track 8 on the CD. I have loved this movie with the Boychoir performance all my adult life. Yes, I know how primitive and predictable this film is when measured by the whiz-bang techno-blitz of today's movies.. but I suppose that's why I love it so.. it's a retrospective trip where for a scant hour-fifty I can revisit some of the familiar stuff that was around when life really did seem a bit simpler.. having said that, it was pretty tame even at the time. But when the Middle East is ablaze with hostility, and no one can agree on anything anymore, I find it somehow reassuring that elements of this movie still have a universal appeal.",
