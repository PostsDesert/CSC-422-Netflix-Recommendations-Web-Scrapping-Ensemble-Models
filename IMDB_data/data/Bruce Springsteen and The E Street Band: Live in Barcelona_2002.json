        "reviewBody": "The E Street Band fizzled out after the Human Rights Now tour in 1989.\n\nAfter working solo and with other performers, Bruce released an anthology of unreleased/outtakes Tracks album in 1998 and reunited with the band for a world tour.\n\nThe final two shows formed part of this concert film. This was an enjoyable celebration of the bands music from the early days to the Born in the USA era and a few songs from Tracks and some new material including (American Skin) 41 shots which was a controversial song choice dealing with race and police brutality.\n\nThe concert is the band together again, enjoying themselves and truly rock the joint.\n\nThe band would come together to make a new album, but this concert marks the celebration of an era of a band before they got back to start another phase of their story with The Rising.",
