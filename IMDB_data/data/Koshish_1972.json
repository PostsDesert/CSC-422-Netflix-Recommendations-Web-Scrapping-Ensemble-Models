It is not all about their dignity to live proudly but it also touches the emotional side of this unique couple. It also represent the struggle of deaf and dumb couple to live a comfortable life style.\n\nThis is third movie of Gulzar which I watched after Andhi and Machis. Gulzar is changing my views on Indian cinema by some superb writings and directions. Now I am looking forward to Ijaazat, Mausam and Khushboo.\n\nAnd yes Sanjeev must be mentioned because of his splendid performance as a Haricharan. He and Jaya makes the movie more beautiful and emotional.",
