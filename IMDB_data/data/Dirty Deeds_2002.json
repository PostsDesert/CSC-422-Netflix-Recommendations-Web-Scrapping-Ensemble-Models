Every time i see him in stuff i'm amazed at his ability and here he gives a really moving performance. The young bloke is really good too, and some of the guys the filmakers have found to play small time hoods have fantastic faces.\n\n The direction is cool, the script really is fast and funny and its got a great soundtrack as well. Hope this gets shown in the UK so all my mates can see it to?",
