        "reviewBody": "I'm picking up the show these last few months. I've found it to be nice knee slapping (funny) show. The show hearkens back to the original's concept of putting characters in silly social situations. However they do take themselves seriously. Near latter part of the series, it does start to come apart become bit too silly fighting Yamata's nasty bad luck.\n\nIf you compare this show with too the newly release Tenchi Muy么!Ryo OhKI (season 2) which has been released in Summer of 2005. (not even on the IMDb yet of this writing.) The GXP is still a better series in comparison. Makers of newest Tenchi Muy么! OVA (This is resumption of the original OVA series from 1992.) draw heavily from the GXP be series success and story events to reinforce resuming of Tenchi Muy么! OVA series. However, its crappier in comparison to GXP. CGI at times is spotty, English voice acting is not as good, missing key voices and bad choices of replacements.\n\nGXP's is a tighter ship, if not for its flaws beyond episodes 17+.\n\nExcellent series, a very re-watchable Scifi comedy series!!!"
