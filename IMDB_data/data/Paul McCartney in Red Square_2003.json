        "reviewBody": "McCartney is back with Rusty Anderson, Brian Ray, Abe Laboriel Jr. And Paul 'Wix' Wickens - aka his best band since The Beatles - playing all the Beatles and Wings hits you can imagine as well as a few deep cuts from those two super groups - nineteen songs in all.\n\nThe most exciting thing about this brilliant concert is that - as the title suggests - the concert is taking place in Moscow's Red Square(and there's a concert in St Petersburg on the DVD as well, with an outstanding version of 'Helter Skelter' and 'I've Got A Feeling) and at one stage, Vladimir Putin joins the crowd. This gets McCartney to reprise his most poignant song given the circumstances - Back in the USSR, at full tilt - and the crowd predictably goes nuts.\n\nSeeing the emotion on the faces of people in the crowd (and listening to the documentary-style pieces that are inserted between songs) you get an understanding of how McCartney and the Beatles made an impression on people in the USSR, even if their music was not exactly state-sponsored. Music really can bridge all sorts of gaps, be they generational, financial or even political.\n\nWhy doesn't this one get 10 out of 10? Simple: the cut-down version of Band on the Run. C'mon guys! What were the producers thinking? Either feature the entire Wings epic or none of it at all.",
