The plot was good, the acting wasn't that sucky, and this movie had a great beginning. Don't get me wrong, this movie had a good potential, and it had Betsy Palmer and hot girls, but turned out to be a mess in the end. Low budget, a lame score, off-screen deaths, and a killer that is to laugh for, make \"FEAR : THE RESURRECTION\" a bad horror film. What is a slasher film without on-screen deaths? \n\nAnyways, check it out and think : more budget, and more wishes to make a good movie would make this a good one."
