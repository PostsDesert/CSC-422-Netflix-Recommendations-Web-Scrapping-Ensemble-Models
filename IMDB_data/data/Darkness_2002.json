        "reviewBody": "I knew nothing about this film until I stumbled across it while reading reviews for another movie. So, I checked out what people were saying, and having read so many mixed reviews on it, I had to see it for myself. I love scary movies...always have. And I'm a particular fan of any movie that can bring back that feeling of terror one experiences as a child...whether from watching movies, or fearing the ever-present monsters in the closet. At times, this movie was able to do that.\n\nDarkness starts out strong, grabbing you in out of sheer morbid curiosity. Throughout, there are moments of profound creepiness quite similar to the flashes of the twin daughters in The Shining. Actually, this movie has some similarities to the old classic, although it falls far short of what the Shining was able to accomplish.\n\nThere are some drawbacks to this movie. The acting is, well, not entirely believable. And, in my opinion, Paquin is not at her best in this movie. Many of the lines fall flat and have you sitting there scratching your head goin \"huh?\" These moments come quite frequently when watching the dialogue between Mother and Daughter...it simply isn't believable. The other main drawback is the copout explanation of events. Like with many horror films, the movie starts out strong with an intriguing storyline, only to have the writers throw together a flittery, half-witted explanation to everything. Darkness follows that formula to a T, unfortunately.\n\nHowever, amongst the drawbacks are moments of great potential and overall eeriness that is missing in many of today's films. Also, the ending in and of itself is a breath of fresh air in comparison to the stereotypical hollywood ending found in far too many movies.\n\nHad I spent $8 on this film, I probably would have been disappointed and wanted my money back. However, this is definitely worth a rental cost...especially for a \"horror movie night\" or a teens sleepover. Don't expect a great one...but don't expect a dud either.\n\nIf you're looking for jumps and that creepy feeling reminiscent of a childhood fear of the dark, this is the movie for you.\n\nOverall, I give this ***1/2 out of five.",
