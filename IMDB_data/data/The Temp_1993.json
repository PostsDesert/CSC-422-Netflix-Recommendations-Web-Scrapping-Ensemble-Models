        "reviewBody": "THE TEMP stars Timothy Hutton as marketing executive, Peter Derns. When his assistant leaves suddenly, the title character, named Kris Bolin (Lara Flynn Boyle) arrives to fill in. At first, everything runs swimmingly, due to Kris' amazing skills, and her innate ability to overcome adversity. She seems too good to be true.\n\nWhen a series of serendipitous \"accidents\" occur, causing mutilation and death, Peter remains oblivious to the obvious. Meanwhile, Kris starts doing exceptionally well, even attaining executive status!\n\nThis movie is as much a black comedy as it is a thriller. It could easily be viewed as a biting satire of big business, climbing the corporate ladder, etc. Hutton's paranoid, everyman character would fit right into the likes of CATCH-22, THE TRIAL, or DR. STRANGELOVE. It helps that Faye Dunaway, who starred in NETWORK, one of the greatest black comedies of all time, has a role as head of the corporation.\n\nA great movie to watch if you've had a terrible day at work..."
