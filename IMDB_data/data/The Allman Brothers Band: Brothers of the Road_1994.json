        "reviewBody": "This is the Allman Brothers in concert at the Capitol Theater in the mid-to-early 1980s. Also on the tape is a two-song, 10-minute unplugged session. I found this - maybe because it was different - to be the most interesting segment to watch and hear. Greg Allman just plays and sings by himself on \"Come and Go Blues.\" I appreciated his acoustic guitar work on that number.\n\nThe rest of this is the ordinary Allman Brothers concert, meaning good songs but nothing visually to offer. Most of it solid, hard-driving rock and blues with some excellent guitar playing by Dickie Betts. However, since so much of the music is the same, it gets to be too much after awhile. A good slow, bluesy-type number in the middle would have improved this tape a lot. \n\nOn personal tastes, I always thought \"One Way Out\" was their best number and it sounds great here, too. The 13-minute \"The Judgment,\" featuring a long drum solo, was nothing special, unless you enjoy long drum solos.",
