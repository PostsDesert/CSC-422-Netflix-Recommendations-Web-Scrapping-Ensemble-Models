        "reviewBody": "If followers of Jesus wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls, Jesus would be mentioned in the Dead Sea Scrolls, but he's not, not even once. Are we really expected to believe that the Essenes either spawned Jesus or somehow connected with him and adopted his teachings, and then literally failed to mention him ever again at all? By the time the Dead Sea Scrolls were buried Israel was completely destroyed, so there would no longer be any reason to hide a connection to Jesus or hide Jesus behind a mysterious figure called \"The Teacher.\" This documentary is just another ruse to invent yet another false history for Jesus, who most likely never existed. An invented savior god like all the other savior gods invented during the Messianic era."
