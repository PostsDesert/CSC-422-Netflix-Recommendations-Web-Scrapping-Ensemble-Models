        "reviewBody": "This is one of the most boring films I have ever seen, for 81 minutes all you get is loads of tough looking guys talking about themselves and their experiences of being doormen. There is not nearly enough violence or footage of them actually doing their job to make this watchable, if there was some actual scraps and some real action going on it might grab your interest, but the bouncers themselves have no charisma or presence to make you want to give a s**t about what happens to them or anyone else. The doorman King is such a smug ass that all he talks about are the things offered to him such as blow jobs, cash etc' ,and the fact that none of things ever happen to him doesn't seem to alert him to the fact that he is in his own little dream world. Boring, boring, BORING. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ",
