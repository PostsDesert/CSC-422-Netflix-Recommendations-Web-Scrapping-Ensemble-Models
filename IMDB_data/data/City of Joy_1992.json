Even the role played by patrick swayze was good as he plays an disillusioned doctor. All the casts played good role in the movie. \n\nThis movie touches the way of poor people living in calcutta slum, I know because I myself is a bengali and belong to calcutta. The way the poors were reflected in calcutta is actually the way they are treated.\n\nThe best quote of the movie was at the end when the movie ends and when om puri says \"All that is not given is lost.\""
