There was something magical about this one, and I still remember all of the exciting and fantastic elements that made this my second favorite. The first one had some scary moments(for a kid, that is) but this one was much more upbeat and friendly. It will always have a special place in my heart, and my children's hearts as well. I can't believe the people who've panned this film! You need to re-live your childhoods again, or lighten up! \n\n10/10",
