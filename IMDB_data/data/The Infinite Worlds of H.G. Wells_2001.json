All the supporting characters were nicely developed with very few light touches. The two main characters of H. G. Wells and his scientist wife were really charming. Their story of courting was told so effectively in parallel with the main storyline of various mysterious events. The period details were faultless and lively. I almost felt I was there with all of them! And the most important of all, the stories themselves (6 in total) gave me the kind of pleasure and fun mixed with curiosity that I used to feel two decades ago as a child, reading Jules Verne books and dreaming of those faraway exotic worlds and adventures. Thanks to everyone involved in this production.",
