It sounds like a real waste of film, but they actually have plot, subplot, character development -- it ain't Citizen Kane, but it sure is a lot of fun. The special effects probably didn't cost more than a lunch at McDonald's, but they were entirely adequate and a real treat to watch.\n\nI thought for a moment that Det. Mackaroni's speech was going to evolve into the Second Coming of Christ (which would have been quite wonderful), but alas they went a different direction. I'm really glad I taped this one.",
