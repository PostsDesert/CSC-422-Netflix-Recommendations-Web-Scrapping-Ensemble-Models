        "reviewBody": "We have seen in the past a growing convergence between movies on history and documentaries trying to look like movies.\n\n\"Ancient Egyptians\" takes a step forward, bringing together a scrupulous attention to facts (from language to scenarios) and super production features (careful casting and acting, special effects, musical score, dramatic plot,...) in a way one can hardly argue against.\n\nMaybe the only 'drawback' could be a false assimilation between modern Egyptian actors and ancient Egyptians that producers decided to exploit. Even after the carefully restored ancient language and superb acting, the Arab look and gestures does bias character performance.\n\nNevertheless, the outcome is a must see. Take every one of the four different tales with time enough to enjoy its delicate features and powerful story telling resources. A more vivid and brighter Egypt will be brought to life for you."
