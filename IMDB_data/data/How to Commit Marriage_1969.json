The writing is definitely in the tone of the grown-ups making fun of the band names during the sixties.\n\nIt was surprising to see Tim Matheson in this movie. Also Tina Louise of Gilligan's Island fame. Leslie Nielsen is another one who is still popular.\n\nBut who is that sensitive sixties band with the dreamy sound and the groovy philosophy? They're called \"The Comfortable Chair\" in the movie, but embarrassing as it is to admit, they sound like a real band from the time. Someone like \"Small Faces\", or whatever their name was."
