It stars Michael Douglas in the lead role (and he IS well cast) as a psychiatrist whose daughter is kidnapped by a bunch of men who want him to extract a six-digit number from a mentally disturbed young lady. Both parties then proceed to match wits en route to a great climax towards the end of the movie.\n\nThis was based on the book by the same name. The book was quite good, too. I rank this movie as your typical thriller with good twists.\n\n *** out of ****"
