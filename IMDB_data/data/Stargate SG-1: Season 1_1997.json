I've just watched the first 6 episodes of season 4 and each and every one of them has been a cracker.\n\nThis show has lots going for it; intelligent and convincing plots, great multi-dimensional characters, superb actors (both major and minor players), expert direction (hats off to Peter DeLuise), continuity of story, consistent use/appearance of sci-fi technology, witty but subtle dialog and almost as an aside, stunning FX.\n\nThe only thing left to say is that I feel sorry for people that haven't been watching up till now. Please, it's not too late."
