I picture this is how an actual police department and it's homicide investigations are conducted...with professionalism and seriousness. I enjoyed this consistent feel the director kept throughout the film. The casting was very good and effective at keeping this feel of realism. I hope to see Pare and Phillips together in another film! \n\nLee Majors is a popular actor and it was fun seeing him in the rare antagonist role. I would like to see Majors in more films. As well as Pare and Phillips. At one time or another I have wondered what happened to each of these larger than life actors?"
