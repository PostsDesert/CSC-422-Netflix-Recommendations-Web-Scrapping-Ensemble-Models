She sings a number of beautiful songs with her angelic voice. Her range is pleasantly astounding. Whether you're an opera fan or a pop lover, Sarah can do it all in this concert. Just some of the many highlights are \"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again,\" \"Deliver Me,\" \"Eden,\" \"Only An Ocean Away,\" \"The Music Of The Night,\" \"Who Want To Live Forever\" and \"Il Cuore Mio Va\" (the Titanic song in Italian). If heaven is anything like the music of Sarah Brightman, then \"who wants to live forever?\"",
