        "reviewBody": "Shows like Inspector Gadget, Dangermouse, Scooby Doo, Looney Tunes, Pink Panther Show, Tom and Jerry, The Flintstones, Darkwing Duck, Talespin, DuckTales, Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain and Tiny Toons make me realise how much I miss my childhood. Whenever I see an episode of either of those shows all those warm, nostalgic memories come flooding back.\n\nInspector Gadget is a classic. Forget the movies, which were both quite poor, this show is the real thing. The animation has a great look to it, I loved the designs of the characters and backgrounds and the colours are visually pleasant too. The music alone gives the show its classic status, the theme tune is wonderful. The writing is very consistent in a good way, the stories are always exciting and well-thought out and the pace is spot on.\n\nThe characters add a huge amount to the show. Gadget himself is bumbling yet very lovable, Penny is not irritating instead she is very likable and smart and Dr Claw(who you never see other than his claw) is a great villain. The voice acting also adds a lot, Don Adams, Cree Summer and Frank Welker are all top notch. Overall, this childhood favourite is a classic and worth looking out for. 10/10 Bethany Cox",
