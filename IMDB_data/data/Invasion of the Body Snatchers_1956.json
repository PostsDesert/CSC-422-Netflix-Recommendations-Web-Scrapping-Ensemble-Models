The man then tells the doctor about how a small California town has been invaded by some sort of alien seeds that grow into human clones...\n\nComing straight from the McCarthy era and general Cold War paranoia this is one scary movie. There is not a gun fired, not a drop of gore shed but the final effect of the film will stay with you for a good while. More contemporary film viewers might recognize the concept from John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" which itself was an update of the 1951 film. However, the themes of paranoia and tension are just as nail-biting and intense here.\n\nThere is a lack of visual punch that so many people are used to today, but just think of the historical context and the implications, basically use your mind! Then you'll see why the film scared studio executives so much that they forced Don Siegel to add an intro and outro to help soften the overall effect. It wasn't the best play in the book, but the film remains a great classic chiller. --- 9/10\n\nNot Rated. It would most likely receive a PG from the MPAA, there are several tense moments, though no violence.",
