        "reviewBody": "This was a pretty good PPV, which surprised me, because Smackdown's! PPV's are usually rubbish.\n\nMatch one actually took place on Sunday Night Heat, in which Tajiri, Akio and Sakoda took on Paul London, Ultimo Dragon and Kidman in a very good but short match. If only McMahon could get his 'WWE is only a big man's promotion idea' out of his head!\n\nThen all of a sudden WWE changed its minds and laid out some pretty crap matches. These included The Basham Brothers and Shaniqua vs Scotty 2 Hotty and Rikishi in a passable effort, Rhyno vs Hardcore Holly in a boring match (however I must give Holly some credit, he took a nasty spine buster from Rhyno which made my toes curl and the crowds as well!) and the APA vs Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas in a solid but unspectacular effort. \n\nUnlike Wrestlemania 7 were Jake 'the snake' Roberts took on Rick Martel in a memorable blindfold match, the same match putting Nidia and Jamie Noble done nothing for me. Noble cheated and won of course, but why did this match take place?\n\nThe next two matches were good indeed. United States Champion, Big Show faced John Cena and Kurt Angle in a fine match, which shocked me because Cena sucks on the technical side of wrestling. Then Brock Lesnar put his WWE title on the line against Eddie Guerrero in a fine match. The only thing that spoiled it was Goldberg spearing Lesnar, but it was very solid enough!\n\nAkio/Sakoda/Tajiri vs Dragon/London/Kidman - 8.5/10 Noble vs Nidia - 3/10 Bashams/Shaniqua vs Scotty and Rikishi - 5/10 APA vs WGTT - 5.5/10 Mysterio vs Chavo Guerrero - 7.5/10 Rhyno vs Holly - 5/10 Cena vs Show vs Angle - 7.5/10 Lesnar vs Eddie Guerrero - 8/10",
