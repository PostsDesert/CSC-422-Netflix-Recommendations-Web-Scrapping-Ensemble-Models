If you have ever remotely experienced, witnessed or have known anyone associated with the scenarios outlined in this gritty film, then you will understand. It's characters are believable including the brief cameo by pornography actress Kitten Natividad, who probably knows more about that life style than anyone else on the set. If you are a bleeding heart looking for life's answers through political correctness or stereotypical \"substantitive\" films, do not watch this one. You will be disappointed.",
