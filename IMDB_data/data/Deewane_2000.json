        "reviewBody": "Before I comment on this hopeless and great flop movie, I must warn everyone not to waste your precious 3 hours on this movie. If possible, instead go out with your car and make new friends within these few hours. Yeah, Ajay is back again in his double role after Hindustan Ki Kasam. But this is a movie with a little touch of James Bond 007 or you can accept as a 'desi Bond'. Deewane's plot and script is very poor in nature. It's a big wondering matter how Harry Baweja made such a nonsense movie after his history of Dilwale and Diljale! He wanted to carry on his traditional \"D......E\" type of titles, but unfortunately failed in the third installment which is unlike James Bond route. Also Ajay's double role for second time did not produce any pure scenting smoke, instead resulted in a big bombing at box-office. He played double as a cop and other as a crook made no exception to flop the movie. The twisting love story with another third angle Mahima made it very poor and boring. It's usually a common story 're-wined again and again in a new bottle' with new brand names and looks. Sometimes copying the taste and smell from another brands.\n\nA big fact is that, Deewane was released on the same day with heart-throbbing blockbuster Dhadkan. In that case Mahima had a great achieving as she starred in both these movies as a cameo role. Dhadkan was a huge hit whereas Deewane was out of discussion.",
