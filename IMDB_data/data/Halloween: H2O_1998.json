She wanted to get the whole crew back and John Carpenter to direct. He refused after divorcing himself after his anthology idea was ruined. I consider Halloween, the fog, season of the witch, Prince of darkness and the thing his true series.\n\nWilliamson wrote a script that was quite different from the finished project yet Jamie didn't want her character to be seen as a bad mother.I don't blame her. Who wants to look bad?\n\nThe supporting castes were all fresh faced and did fine. The Halloween theme and scream score mix well together.\n\nThe only problem is Donald Pleasence passed away before It was even dreamed of. \n\nIt truly was the final Halloween in my opinion."
