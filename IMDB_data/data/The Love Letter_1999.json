        "reviewBody": "\"The Love Letter\" was visually pleasing: All the main characters were attractive; the setting was beautiful--the water, boats, birds, narrow streets and old houses; and the book store had an appealing clutter. The movie was sweet and funny. The letter itself was like a main character. The romantic relationship between Helen and Johnny is easy to imagine for no other reason than that they appealed to each other. Add to that the letter's imagery, and the romance becomes even more compelling, more credible. The movie's flavor and texture were consistant--a fine piece of work and a pleasure to watch."
