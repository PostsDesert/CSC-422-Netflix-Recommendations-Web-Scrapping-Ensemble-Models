        "reviewBody": "Being a fan of this British techno-pop group since the late 80's and having accumulated a rather lengthy collection of their pop albums, cd singles and remix albums, I purchased this video which featured their first 20 hits in music videos. To say the least I wasn't disappointed after viewing it in it's entirety. It's nice to see how their videos have progressed and improved over they years since they first collaborated in 1985. Their very first video 'Who Needs Love like That' is a rather cheesy one which has a cowboy, western theme to it and has Andy dressed as a cabaret girl prancing around on stage in a saloon. The video for 'Oh L'amour' is another campy video which features Vince and Andy in a french restaurant setting. In this one Andy is dressed in a black beret and leather jack and god forbid 'black laced stocking'. He said in a later interview that it was a hideous video and one he wanted to forget. Nearly all their videos just feature the boys themselves singing and performing as they don't particularly like lavish or extravagant backgrounds. In every video, Andy always has a different hair-style and look while Vince remains un-changed. Videos like 'A little Respect' is great to watch because the two are acting out each lyric to the song and having fun doing it. Another great video to watch is the very last one 'Take a Chance on me' which has Andy and Vince dressed up to look like the female counterparts of Abba. In all a great video collection of their hit singles. A must for any Erasurehead."
