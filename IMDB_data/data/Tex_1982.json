Hinton adaptations starring Matt Dillon (happy birthday, Matt!) behind \"The Outsiders\"; \"Rumble Fish\" was too weird to make any sense. This one casts him a young man trying to make his way in Oklahoma after his mother dies. Although its status as a Disney movie gives it kind of a strange feeling, it still comes out very well, with good performances by pretty much all the cast members. But I will say that he reached his apex with \"The Outsiders\". In all these movies, he was showing the sort of talent that eventually earned him an Oscar nomination for \"Crash\". Worth seeing. Also starring Meg Tilly, Frances Lee McCain (the \"Gremlins\" mom), Ben Johnson, Emilio Estevez and Zeljko Ivanek.",
