Despite the incidental difference in plot and character, you don't feel any difference - it's star vehicle for Carmen Maura as Molly Bloom.\n\nNever have I seen an actress that made a more fascinating Bitchin' Middle-aged Broad :) She has that old-fashioned Hollywood charisma that no other actress seems to have in the last 20 years. This is good because besides her, this movie has very little to recommend from music, cinematography, plot to characterization (in the order that I noticed them). A point-to-point comparison to the Almodovar masterpiece would serve as a quick & fun Filmmaking 101. And the ending? It feels like the screenwriter flat ran out of idea and screen time.\n\nWhen is someone going to film Ulysses and cast her in it???",
