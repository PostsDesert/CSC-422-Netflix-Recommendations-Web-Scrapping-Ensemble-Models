        "reviewBody": "Hey, this is a kids' movie and a good one. I like time travel movies a lot especially when the traveller takes stuff with him (like inlines).\n\nThere a couple of real cool parts that I think stand out to make this movie appealing. The wooden bicycle is awesome even if it didn't last very long. The kid taking the knight's place in the jousting near the end was predictable but satisfying. And King Arthur and the princess coming to the future at the end made for a good windup.\n\nNow I watch movies like this for pure enjoyment and never (on purpose) look at technicalities. I've spoiled several movies for myself that way. This is one of those movies that probably won't stand up to dissection very well. But, it made me laugh and it gave me a feel-good ending so I feel it did its job. People seem to dis a lot on predictability in movies, but if it works, why not use it. I like a nice happy ending. Movies are something I watch for pure enjoyment anyway. If I want reality, I watch the news.\n\nThis kid did two time travel movies that I know of (this one and \"A Kid in Aladdin's Palace.\" I liked em both. Another nice time travel movie for kids was \"Durango Kids\".\n\nThis movie was in no way original as there have been a whole lot of movies based on \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\". Still, it had enough unique parts to make it worthwhile. Most kids should like this one.",
