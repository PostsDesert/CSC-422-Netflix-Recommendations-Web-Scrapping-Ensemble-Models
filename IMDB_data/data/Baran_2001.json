The story is in some scenes humorous, in others moving.\n\nThis film has lessons to teach in humanity and generosity.\n\nIt is also a window for viewers in Western countries (such as myself) whose lives are so far removed from those of the characters and real people like them. Very few films have to ability to transport you to another place so completely, as this film does.",
