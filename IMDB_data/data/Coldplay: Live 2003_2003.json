Me and my girlfriend (the beaty Remigia) are great fans of them, that's why do we find these guys and their songs so great. Sometimes we listen to their songs together but now that we have their new live DVD it's good to watch them rock, because we didn't have had the chance to watch them live. Politik and Clocks do rock,like no other, but The Scientist is harmonic and pleasant. Among all songs (we think) that Yellow is the best. That is it! Their new ones are also huge and I just can't wait for the new album! So hurry up boys!",
