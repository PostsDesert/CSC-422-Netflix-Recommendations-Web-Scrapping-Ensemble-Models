        "reviewBody": "I have seen dozens of National Geographic shows and must say that \"The Photographers\" is the most unusual of them all. Instead of focusing on some animal or group or place, its focus is on the photographers who have worked for the magazine...and in particular some recent ones. This affords the folks to come out from behind their cameras and be recognized for their hard work and amazing talents. I was amazed to hear how often these folks have had malaria, parasitic worms, been robbed as well as the awful conditions and patience they require...as well as the hundreds of shots they take just to get that one outstanding shot...and all before digital cameras became available!\n\nThe show, like many by National Geographic, is narrated by Keith David, a man with a gorgeous voice. But often they show just let the photographers talk and narrate their own stories. My favorite was the one about the Peruvian boy whose sheep were killed...the outcome is quite touching. All in all, a most enjoyable show...and a unique one at that.",
