        "reviewBody": "This is a film about the Vatican that is narrated by Martin Sheen. It purports to be a behind the scenes look into the inner workings and daily goings on at this micro-State. It consists of various interviews, lots of interesting film footage and a tiny bit of background information. It is all very interesting but also a bit brief--too brief considering how extensive the place is and the history of the place. You cannot boil almost 2000 years of history into less than an hour! A mini-series on the place and on the papacy itself would be wonderful. But, to the film's credit, it wasn't all positive and public relations, as it also talked briefly about a few of the evil popes--such as Julius II and Alexander VI (who was super-evil). Overall, the film is well worth seeing--whether you are Catholic or not. Full of interesting facts and scenes that make it a nice introduction to the place.",
