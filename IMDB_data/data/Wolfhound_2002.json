And the once Penthouse Girl of the Year is not bad either (for the eye that is). And if you are spoiled by Twilight, this definitely is not for teens (in America that is). As it seems I also watched the unrated version (do wonder what they cut though ... can't be violence, so it must be some of the nudity).\n\nThe movie does not have a big story, the acting is mediocre at best, the editing tries to be fancy and if you actually think there are not enough supernatural movies out there (check the TV show, although I haven't seen it, I'm sure it more than worth it, plus will give you enough hours to enjoy), then maybe you will find this intriguing. Or you like the really beautiful woman (who's also on the cover) ... Nothing wrong with that. Other than that, stay clear of this",
