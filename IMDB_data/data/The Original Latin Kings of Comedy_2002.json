However...if you don't speak Spanish, beware that you are actually going to miss about half of the jokes. We tried to turn on the English subtitles, so that we could get the entire experience, and the DVD doesn't translate the Spanish jokes into English on the subtitles!!! That was a bit frustrating! We were disappointed that there was so much of a language barrier when we are more than willing to support the Latin Kings just as we have enjoyed many other comics who have come out with DVDs/videos. I think the DVD would definitely have been better if we could have enjoyed all of the jokes."
