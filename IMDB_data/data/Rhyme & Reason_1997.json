They get so excited when we're going to watch \"Daisy and Cole\". They will even watch it instead of paw patrol which is a feat in itself.\n\nThe songs are revamped and catchy, the show has a storyline that goes with nursery rhymes and the characters are fun! Mary Mary is my favorite. She's a sassy hedgehog :)",
