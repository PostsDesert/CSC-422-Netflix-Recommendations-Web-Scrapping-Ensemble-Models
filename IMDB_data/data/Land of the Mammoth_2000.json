        "reviewBody": "Despite being based on a kids show, this is not really a kids' film. The dialog can be a bit adult at times! And Chaka seemed to spend an awful lot of his time groping Holly! I could try to describe the plot, but frankly it's too bizarre and defies my sad ability to describe it. Suffice to say it's about three people (two of which are total idiots) stuck in some bizarre land where time/space are all jumbled and they have to somehow make things right and get back home. In the process, you see lots of dinosaurs and strange creatures that make this film like taking a hit of LSD.\n\nI need to point out that I never saw the TV show \"Land of the Lost\" as I was a bit too old to watch it--and I hated Sid & Marty Krofft's shows (though they DID produce this movie). And, when I heard that this movie was coming out, I wasn't thrilled as I didn't want to see a silly kids show on the big screen. However, the film makers instead chose to parody their show--making fun of it by making several of the credits just too dumb to believe--sort of like sticking Ricky Bobby and Kyle Naughton, Jr. in a position to save the universe! Often the really dumb jokes, dialog and situations made me laugh but the film was uneven as well. There were also quite a few scenes that fell very flat or were just rather gross and super-low brow (such as the urine scene). For Will Ferrell fans, this would all be very familiar territory but for others it will probably be rather stupid and nonsensical. Low-brow and dumb throughout..but for me, in a good way.\n\nOverall a very stupid movie...that STILL made me laugh.\n\nBy the way, Danny McBride sure seemed to be doing a great imitation of John C. Reilly. His character was a lot like the ones Reilly played in the Will Ferrell movies \"Talladega Nights\" and \"Step-Brothers\"--really, really dumb and quite funny. I wonder if this part was originally intended for Reilly--it was that close.\n\nDig that Matt Lauer! He's so darn cool!",
