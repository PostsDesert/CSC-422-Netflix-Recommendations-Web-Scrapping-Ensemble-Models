        "reviewBody": "Although I enjoyed the talents of Ginger Rogers more in her infamous teamings with Fred Astaire, and her comic abilities in the Katharine Hepburn movie \"Stage Door\", she cannot at least be given some credit for her fine dramatic acting as well, of which pleasantly surprised me. Her portrayal a woman convicted for manslaughter, is inspirational, as her character helps a suffering soldier find solace, while attempting to hide the secret she dreads will threaten his full recovery.\n\nWith Joseph Cotten and Shirley Temple in the supporting cast, the movie is nonetheless up to mainstream Hollywood standards. I did find that the movie was a little light on the drama in some parts, in comparison to later Hollywood films like Audrey Hepburn's \"The Nun's Story\", but the romance story was lovely.\n\nDefinitely a must for Ginger Rogers fans, and fans of a good old fashioned Hollywood flick in the best style that they just don't make anymore.
