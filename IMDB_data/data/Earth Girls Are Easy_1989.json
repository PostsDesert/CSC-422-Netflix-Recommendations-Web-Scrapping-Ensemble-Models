        "reviewBody": "Three furry multicolored aliens (Jeff Goldblum, Jim Carrey, Damon Wayans) land their spaceship in Geena Davis' pool. Wackiness follows. This is a fun little musical comedy with a great cast that's having a blast and it shows. Goldblum, Carrey, and Wayans are all good but it's the girls who really make this one work. Geena Davis is funny as well as being smoking hot in this. Julie Brown owns every scene she's in. She's a riot and her songs are great. Music video director Julien Temple maintains a brisk pace throughout. This is a colorful, bubbly comedy that I think will appeal to a variety of viewers. It's got '80s stamped all over it so if you enjoy movies from that decade (and you should), you'll enjoy this one.",
