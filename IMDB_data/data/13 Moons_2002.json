        "reviewBody": "What we have here is an attempt to shape a movie by simply defining interesting characters. These aren't radical characters like, say you would get with \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" inspired projects. \n\nYou have a few choices when sitting down to write a story. One of these is to decide what sort of agency your characters have. To my mind, the best storytellers start with a world, a notion of sweeps within that world that creates situations or drives or needs. Within all those gusts you place characters, or perhaps (depending on the world) your characters are secreted by other forces.\n\nNoir, the great invention of cinematic storytelling has this character. Cinematic storytelling is different than writing because you see the world with the people. With the written world you can separate them and the world always comes through some voice.\n\nThis is to say that starting with characters is risky in film. I think it never works, ever, by itself. These aren't particularly interesting characters. But if they were, you would need something else to season them: some dialog or situations.\n\nIt didn't work here.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."
