I'm Serbian from Belgrade, so I understand what the really point of this movie is. The sentance when Rasha says:\" There is no place like Mostar\" remindes me on my friend Marko Pishtalo from history studies in Belgrade. Exceally, he is Bosnian immigrant from Mostar just like Rasha in this movie. For those who didn't know that is one of the most beautiful Bosnian cities. Sincerelly yours Dushan Petrovic from Belgrade, Serbia.",
