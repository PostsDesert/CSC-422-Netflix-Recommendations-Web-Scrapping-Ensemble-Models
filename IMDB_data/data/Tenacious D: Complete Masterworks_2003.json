You'll be hard-pressed to find a frontman as vigorous as JB. He is humorous, but also positively intense. He has a remarkable vocal range. Kyle's guitar work is highly commendable as well.\n\n The episodes from HBO and other exploits on the DVD are worthwhile, but not as enjoyable for me as the concert. I do recommend this DVD in its entirety. Anyone who dislikes the use of the \"f\" word may not agree with me."
