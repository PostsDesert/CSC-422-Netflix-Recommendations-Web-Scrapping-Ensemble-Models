        "reviewBody": "After accidentally killing his brother-in-law in a fight a young farmer by the name of \"Kurt Westover\" (Gary Busey) rides away from his small German immigrant village in Texas and heads for the Mexican border in an effort to escape the vengeance of his father-in-law \"Herman Pahmeyer\" (George Voskovec) and his other two sons \"Otto Pahmeyer\" (Kai Wulff) and \"Floyd Pahmeyer\" (Wolf Muser). However, not being used to the life of a fugitive, Kurt soon finds himself out of his element and it's then that he meets a notorious outlaw by the name of \"Barbarosa\" (Willie Nelson) who reluctantly takes him under his wing and teaches him how to survive against both nature and ruthless people in general. It's also during this time that it's revealed that Barbarosa has met a similar situation with his father-in-law \"Don Braulio Zavala\" (Gilbert Roland) who has also sent family members after him to avenge the murder of two of his sons as well. But what neither Don Braulio nor Herman Pahmeyer realize is that-based on the mutual support of their two intended targets--gaining their revenge is going to be even more difficult from that point on. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this turned out to be a surprisingly better film than I initially realized due in large part to the acting of Willie Nelson who seemed quite suitable for his specific role. Admittedly, a couple of the scenes could have used a bit more substance here and there but all things considered I found this to be an enjoyable film for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",
