It was definitely wasted in such a late time slot on Australian TV. The TV network and film would have benefited from an earlier time slot.\n\nIt had great atmosphere, sets, locations and an excellent British supporting cast. This gave the film an eerie atmosphere reminiscent of the British \"Prime Suspect\" series.\n\nI was surprised by the American casting although Andrew McCarthy was likable and vulnerable as the lead.\n\nThe script and direction were very good and the British cast were superb. I was hooked on the story and for a change I didn't work out who the Killer was till the end.\n\nI hadn't I seen or heard of this film before?",
