        "reviewBody": "The animated The Power of the Daleks features a first. The post regenerative Doctor played by Patrick Troughton interacting with his companions Ben and Polly. Both of them are confused and so is the Doctor. He refers to himself in the third person, unsure if he is the Doctor and so are Ben and Polly. I actually found Ben to be rather aggressive in much of the story here.\n\nWhat is rather refreshing is that the second Doctor might be in a post regenerative fog but at least he is not out of action and confined to a bed for long periods which seems to affect the subsequent Doctors.\n\nThe Tardis lands on the planet Vulcan where a human colony is having to deal with a rebel faction. The Governor of the colony seems to be an affable sort but some of his men are plotting, there is an Iago among the ranks.\n\nAn examiner has been sent by Planet Earth to investigate the colony and is murdered. The Doctor takes his place by taking his badge. Chief scientist Lesterson has found a crashed capsule which contains a few dormant Daleks, despite the Doctor's protestations, he wants to power them up. At first the humans find the Daleks to be subservient and helpful, they are just here to serve mankind.\n\nThe Doctor knows better though and the Daleks are playing a long game.\n\nThe helpful Daleks trope was revisited in the Matt Smith era; Victory of the Daleks. The Daleks were shown to with more nuance here, cunning and duplicitous.\n\nAs for the colonist. A part of me thought that when these humans were sent from Earth to Vulcan, the average IQ of both planets went up!\n\nThere was a lot of stupidity in display here. The Governor putting his trust in one person who was influential with the security force, humans trusting the Daleks repeatedly.\n\nFor a story of its time, this six part moves along at a nice pace, although I did think this could had easily been done in four parts.\n\nAs for the animation. It certainly is low budget in places, some of the movements reminded me of Captain Pugwash. At other times the producers break free to make good use of animation sequences such as the overhead shot of the Daleks.\n\nHowever we finally get to see Patrick Troughton's first full story as the Doctor.",
