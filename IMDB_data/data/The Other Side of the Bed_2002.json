        "reviewBody": "THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BED is a musical / comedy about two couples. This is the end with any similarity on any American movie in several years.\n\nHere the romance is not the main point. The sex is. The story is simple. Two couples (Javier / Sonia and Paula / Rafa), very good old friends. One day, Paula end his relation with Rafa for another mystery man (who is not other than Javier). They have a friendly break up, but Rafa obsessed tries to find out who is the other guy asking Javier for help. Javier, is not sure about leaving Sonia creating a crisis on his new relation with Paula, plus the problems trying to hide everything to his best friend.\n\nOn the other side, as Rafa gets more depressed Sonia gets hook on his tenderness and a few days later they are having an affair. Of course, Javier notices something happens to Sonia and goes to his friend for help. Add to the mess: another couple in a similar situation, a lesbian, a detective, a non stop talking friend plus some songs and dancing.\n\nYou can realise that the thing is not a tragedy even if it looks like that. And this is the best thing. Not only there is a lot of humor, but the end is not moralizing or sad; is just what EVERYBODY deep inside wished.\n\nThe acting ranges from excellent (almost all men) to very good (Vega, Verbeke and Esteve). Men characters are better developed than women´s, but (I believe) is because men´s reactions on this type of situations are funnier.\n\nAs I stated before, this movie is not about romance, is about how little things destroy a couple even when love still exist. And sometimes, the only solution is to clear our moral limitations and look for new things and experiences. That does not mean an orgy or an bizarre sexual experience, but just starting again in a different way.\n\nI am a Christian, and according to my education, everything here is sin. But according to the Bible, who makes de mistake and repents (then learning from them) is the one to be saved.\n\nMy hopes are a commercial release for this movie and that the MPAA does not declare this movie NC-17 only because of the subject resolution. The nudity sex scenes are very light."
