        "reviewBody": "So it is, right at the first frame next to the title, \"a romantic musical comedy\" is the tagline -- up front with no misconception whatsoever for everyone to see. The entrance is grand in Patrick Doyle's scoring style, along with the credit treatment on red satin and all. What an invitation! 'Like it already. Shakespeare would approve and applaud.\n\n It's truly \"there's no business like show business like no business I know.\" Here Shakespeare and his comedy of errors, a-mixing and a-matching love signals at play again. This common \"love bug\" (literally so) theme is ever present: in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", in \"Much Ado About Nothing\", it's all love wires a-blindly and mistaken assumptions a-crisscrossing. 'Tis all seeds of \"Love's Labour's Lost.\" \n\nThe outstanding ensemble cast, the charming pairings of the lovers, the song and dance numbers (including a sizzling \"Let's face the music and dance\"), the costumes and sets, Branagh's script and the \"Cinetone News\" segments, his impeccable direction, and Patrick Doyle, a vital collaborator who provided the attractive score -- collectively made this romantic musical comedy most entertaining.\n\nBranagh's passion in showing off Shakespeare in film media for all to enjoy is beyond evident. It all seem so facile, yet obviously there's plenty of love in nourishing this dream, lots of labour unrelenting from all involved in this production, and the lost would be Branagh's total steadfast lost in realizing this project -- love, labour, 'lost' shiningly shows. He's out done himself!\n\nIf you like musicals, romantic comedies, light-hearted Shakespeare -- go for it. The only special effect here is Branagh's magic.",
