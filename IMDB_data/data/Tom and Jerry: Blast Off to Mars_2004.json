The living room was my favorite part, because of all those ancient artifacts inside. In my opinion, that's my idea of a living room. Too bad our favorite \"friend-and-foe-alike\" twosome let their antics make such an exquisite room go to waste! The kitchen part, however, was too commonplace. It's the same old iron-board, sink-full-of-dishes, flaming-oven-burners gag, etc., etc., etc.... at least I'm glad there's no lady of the house to give Tom a piece of her mind, no matter how we see her, be it full-body OR from the waist down."
