        "reviewBody": "Even if you didn't experience the joy of 90-s culture in your own life, you can notice it in the music and movies. That being said, this movie is a true testament to that. Featuring young Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock ( this was her breakthrough role, and some people even today view her through this role) on a bus that can't drop below 50 miles per hour, or it will explode, you have a great concept. What you get from that concept is a 1 hour of pure action and that 90-s movie chemistry between the characters (especially between Keanu and Sandra) followed by negotiations with the bomber. It's a real blast (no pun intended) from the past, and with that said, you can easily overlook it's little flaws and unrealistic scenes. It's such a joy to watch and fills your heart with warmness, so it should be appreciated for that. Not a lot of movies today pull that off. 8.5/10 from me, and a warm recommendation! Enjoy! :D ;)",
