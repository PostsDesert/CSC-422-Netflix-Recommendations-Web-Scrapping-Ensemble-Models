This is a movie for\n\nanyone who thinks that kids who grow up to be drug addicts and\n\ndrug users have only themselves to blame. What's particularly\n\ndisturbing is how the biggest antagonists for Liam, and his friend\n\nPinball are not people their own age, but rather adults. Some\n\nscenes are very unnerving and hard to watch simply because the\n\nhazing and degradation that the fifteen-year-old characters endure\n\nis at the hands of people who behave like insecure playground\n\nbullies, but are members of a powerful organized crime force.\n\nEven though I'm pretty close to the age of the main character, I can\n\nbarely imagine what the nightmarish experiences he endures\n\nmust be like.\n\nThe movie is emotionally devastating nearly all the way though. It's\n\nmoments of levity are welcome, but few. There's points where it\n\nseems as though everything will turn out alright, but then\n\nsomething else happens that throws everything off-course. For a\n\nrelaxing and enjoyable time, this is not a movie to see. But if you're\n\nlooking for something that will move you, shock you and really\n\nmake you think (and appreciate your own situation) than Sweet\n\nSixteen is the one too see.\n\n10/10",
