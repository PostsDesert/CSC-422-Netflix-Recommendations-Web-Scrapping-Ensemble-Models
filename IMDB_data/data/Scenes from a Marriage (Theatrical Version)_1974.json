Unfortunately, the last three seemed to deacceletate, and weaken the overall impact it could of have. Almost, like it over did it with the psychological insights. Never the less even in the last episodes their were moments that seemed brilliant and tender. I am definitely glad I watched it, and personally benefited from its discussions on guilt and the issues that arise from it. I will omly add that the film serms to go beyond the question of marital happiness and seems actually about the nature of life and love itself. Just my opiniom.",
