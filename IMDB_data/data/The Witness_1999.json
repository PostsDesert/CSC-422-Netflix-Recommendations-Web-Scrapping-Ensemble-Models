Promise me that if you ever see this 'movie' on your video store shelf, run away from it at full speed and vow never to go back to that video store again. Hop a jet and leave state! Just never submit yourself to watching this so-called 'movie'. If you have a copy of the tape in your possession, burn it! It doesn't deserve to exist! Avoid this movie.......1/2* out of 5."
