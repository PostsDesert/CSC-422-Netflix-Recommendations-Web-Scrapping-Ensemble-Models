        "reviewBody": "\"The Big Bus\" was released in 1976, four years before the landmark disaster flick-spoof, \"Airplane!\". Why \"The Big Bus\" was not as popular a film is a mystery, because it is every bit as funny as \"Airplane!\". The dialogue is witty, the sight gags are hilarious and plentiful, and the acting is just dead-pan enough to make it all work. Joseph Bologna and Stockard Channing head up an all-star cast heading from New York to Denver on a nuclear-powered bus, which is supposed to make the trip with no stops, but of course, disasters ensue. The bus is a luxury vehicle, complete with a piano bar, swimming pool, bowling alley and dining room. If you haven't seen \"The Big Bus\" check it out. It will make you laugh out loud."
