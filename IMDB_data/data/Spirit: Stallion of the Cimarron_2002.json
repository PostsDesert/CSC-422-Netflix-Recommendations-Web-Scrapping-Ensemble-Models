It was a refreshing break from the normal smash and explosion of the modern movie world, and I found it particularly interesting that the animals although intelligent didn't talk the narrator did that, (the narrator supposedly being Spirit reflecting back on his life) All in All a good, no Very Good Family Film. I hope we will see more like it.",
