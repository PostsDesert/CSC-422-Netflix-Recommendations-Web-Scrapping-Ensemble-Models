        "reviewBody": "This movie has just about as much wrong with it as right. While the plot involving greed and a search for gold is excellent and there was a good movie underneath it all, several things help to derail the production and keep this from being a better film--despite its wonderful cast. First, the beginning and ending song by Jose Feliciano is very dated and very annoying. I hated it thoroughly. Second, a lot of really fine character actors enter the film and unfortunately, in most cases, they die so quickly and without making much of an impact on the film, it's a real waste. Third, the ending is great if you have a strong ability to suspend disbelief AND you believe in a lot of spiritual mumbo jumbo. I didn't and so I thought the ending was pretty dopey. Gregory Peck is fine in the film, as always, but I thought it very odd that they cast Omar Sharif as a Mexican and Ted Cassidy and Julie Newmar as American Indians but this is only a minor quibble.",
