        "reviewBody": "I always find it hard to watch a french movie from the eighties -I am french though, and a real patriot, be sure of that- because it feels like I'm trapped in my childhood or something and I will have to go to school or..whatever. It is always painful. For instance, the girl playing 'SAbine' in L'Amour en fuite is 'Dorothée', a T.V. figure from when I was seven or so. She was awful, supposedly very mean to children -but her show was devoted to them, weird, uh?- and a lesbian. But let's go back to Truffaut's movie: I am a big fan of Jean-Pierre Léaud, and in this movie his character Antoine Doisnel is still the same selfish, ridiculously precious little dandy. But I still love him ! It is very funny that in the end he goes back to something that looked a lot -to me- like a sub- La Maman et la Putain (from Eustache). Torn apart between several lost loves and one that is young and not tragic... What will Antoine do? Flee, as usual? You will have to see the movie I guess ! At least for Souchon's cool interpretation of the song he composed for the movie. What a smart guy ! Now he can sell tons of records.",
