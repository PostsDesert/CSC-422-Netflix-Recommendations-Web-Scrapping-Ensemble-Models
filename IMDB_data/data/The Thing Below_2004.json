        "reviewBody": "This film's plot is a rehash of Alien. Only here the evil critter is not found in outer space but fifteen miles under the Earth. Of course the US Government wants this thing, and wants to keep it hush hush, God knows why. Of course it gets loose on the oil platform where it was pulled out of the ground from and mayhem ensues.\n\nOne of the many problems is, the group of characters boarding the oil rig is straight out of the movie clich√© handbook. The haunted leader, the bald black man, the inexplicable hot blonde chick, and the eccentric guy, who in this case thinks he's Butch Cassidy (including hat and six shooter).\n\nAnother is, this was made in Canada and many of the actors portraying Americans speak with a Doug and Bob MacKenzie accent, kinda weird eh? On the plus side, there is a far too long strip tease sequence performed by what looked to be an up and coming porn star (this accounts for my second star).\n\nThey obviously had some money to spend but the lousy acting, hokey cartoon alien and woeful, annoying \"on the nose\" dialogue drag this thing deeper than the underwater tomb their monster allegedly came from.",
