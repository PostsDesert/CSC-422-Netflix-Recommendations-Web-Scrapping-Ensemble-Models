        "reviewBody": "Not to be confused with Tenchi Muyo, Kotetsu Tenshi Kurumi is the story of a young temple boy named Nagato. One day some school mates convince Nagato to break into a house belonging to someone they call Dr. Evil. Rumours say that Dr. Evil is using young girls for sinister experiments and they want to check it out. Nagato discovers a busty young woman with long pink hair wearing a maid's outfit in the basement. He wonders if it is a mannequin and comes closer to look. An earth tremor causes the woman to fall on him and their lips touch. Then the maid wakes up and calls Nagato master! That is how we first meet Kurumi the Steel Angel.\n\nNext come Saki and Karinka, two more Metal Angels who come to live with shy boy Nagato. Saki was activated by Kurumi's kiss and so has a strange attraction to her. Karinka was sent by the government to retrieve Kurumi but eventually changed sides. Being the \"youngest\" of the group she often tries to get Nagato's attention.\n\nThe character designs for this show are pretty good even for the bad-guy-of-the-day. All the Metal Angels good and bad have distinctive outfits and hairstyles. If you like Saber Marionette J then you will probably like this show too. Like the Saber Marionettes the Metal Angels have been created for a secret purpose. Soon to be released in North America. You'll love that catchy theme song!"
