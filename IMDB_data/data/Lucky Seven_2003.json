        "reviewBody": "\"Lucky 7\" was a touching and poignant story of a mother who creates a means to help her young daughter adjust to the fact that she (the mother)is dying, and in so doing she provides a way for the child to keep her mother in her heart and as a part of life. \n\nBy drawing a time-line for her 7 year old daughter,of things that will happen over the years to come,including school, career, and boyfriends, this young mother helps her daughter cope with her loss and makes her a vivid part of her life.\n\nAs the story progresses, you think you know how it will resolve,but there is definitely an element of suspense and surprise. There were no really bad characters here . . . so it doesn't give itself away, just a case of some being better suited than others.\n\nThe performances were very good and true to the characters. They were appealing and drew you into their story.\n\nI really enjoyed this touching romantic comedy -- more romantic than comedy. I recommend \"Lucky 7\" and would watch it again.",
