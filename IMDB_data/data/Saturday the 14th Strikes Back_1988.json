I couldn't believe how bad it was. This is most definitely the worst sequel I've ever seen to a movie. I didn't think the first \"Saturday the 14th\" was anything great, but at least it wasn't horrible, this film is just BAD!\n\nThe acting is quite bad, the story is stupid, the comedy is nearly non-existent, the directing is less than top-notch, the make-up effects and special effects are really bad. The only good thing I can say about this film is the acting of Ray Walston, I don't know why, but I've always liked his acting (although I can't imagine why he would choose to do this role). Other than Ray, this movie is virtually worthless.\n\nI would definitely recommend spending 74 minutes of your life doing something else or watching a better movie, but if you absolutely must, be my guest. Thanks for reading,\n\n-Chris",
