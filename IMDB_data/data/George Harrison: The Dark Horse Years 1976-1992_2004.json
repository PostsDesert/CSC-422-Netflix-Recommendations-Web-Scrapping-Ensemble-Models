Videos include \"Crackerbox Palace\" (I didn't realize until later that the surreal gardens and palace-like house were actually George's residence), Got My Mind Set on You, When We Was Fab (with Pythonesque and Eleanor-Rigbyish video effects), This Song (with George singing to a judge in a parody of the 1976 court ruling on copyright infringement, alleging that George made My Sweet Lord out of the Shirelles' He's So Fine), and others. You gain an insight into George's personality, his sense of humor and can see how he really did not take himself too seriously. If you like George Harrison, you will like this documentary.",
