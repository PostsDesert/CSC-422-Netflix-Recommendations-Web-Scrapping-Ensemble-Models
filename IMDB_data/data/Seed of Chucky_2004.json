        "reviewBody": "The Child's play series, Chucky to most of us started back in the late 1980's with a film of the same name. Child's Play hit the cinema screens across the world, What followed was a small uprising of people wanting to get the film banned, Children even been scared of there Barbie dolls?.\n\nThe film was the tale of a serial killer been forced into the body of a \"Good Guy\" doll,With a little help from Voodoo mixed in,After the success,But also the banning of that film it spawned two more films.\n\nAll was quiet on the western front when in 2000 we was treated with the fourth film, The Bride OfChucky.\n\nChucky been with a bride now they went on a killing spree, Yet again. All was thought lost in that film when they died at the end but we was given with that film a glimmer of hope for we was treated with the vision of a baby.Two doll's having a baby?\n\nHere we are in late 2004 and the fifth film in the Horror/Comedy films is here, The Seed of Chucky is based around that very baby and his quest to find his mum and dad \"Tiffany And Chucky\".\n\nWith them been back in there original doll form they are been used as Hollywood stars for a series of horror films based on there \"Urban Ledgends\" of chaos as none of the previous killings had been solved. With a little help from Mr Voodoo, \"Sh**Face\" brings his mum and dad back into shape and Chucky Been Chucky now wants to teach his son the tricks of the trade.\n\nWhat i like from the off in the Child's play films is the fact that it's the same person doing the voicing for good old Chuckster. Brad Doughry is behind the voice as he was in previous films.\n\nWith this a latest incarnation it's still keeping the funny factor, Scenes of Chucky ramming Britney Spears off the road brings a smile to my face for some reason, Seeing also a doll giving Bishop a good stroke has got to seem funny, Even in writing.Saying the film is still a sick and twisted little picture but yet again, The series has been revived in a good way.\n\nwww.MovieReel.net"
