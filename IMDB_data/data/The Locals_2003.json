I'm a Brit and I have no particular reason to pretend that a film from New Zealand is good if it isn't. BUT THIS IS WONDERFUL STUFF!!! Low budget maybe, low key for sure - but the film takes its time allowing us to get to know our main characters (pretty clich√©d characters but convincing and effective nevertheless. It builds up a spooky atmosphere, allows us to slowly realize that all is not well. The beautiful scenery of the daylight becomes a mysterious place of strange shadows at night. Here is where the lighting works so well. Yes, lots of areas are deliberately over lit - making central occurrences stand out starkly whilst blackness surrounds in a claustrophobic manner. The graveyard is eerily lit - standing like a beacon of badness amidst the shadows. The acting is fine - certainly far better than some of its amateur origins might suggest. I would recommend this film for anyone whether they be a horror fan or a student of film-making on a budget. New Zealand just showed big bucks Hollywood how to make something scary!"
