So why did they use names and symbols from those originals? Now, everybody has expectations and are going to be disappointed. They created new characters and new stories. They should have used new names.\n\nLooking at it as a new story, it still is quite bad. Basically the story is too random. Too many things are happening without a cause or reason.\n\nIf you're looking for a deeper lesson or meaning, like in the book: there is none.\n\nI'm sad this movie is not the new fantasy world it could be. I'm angry the makers used an original piece of art to sell their garbage.",
