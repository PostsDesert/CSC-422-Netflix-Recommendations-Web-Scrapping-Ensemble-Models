        "reviewBody": "Astaire plays ballet star Pete \"Petrov\" Peters who falls for Rogers (Linda Keene).He arranges to cross the Atlantic aboard the same ship as Rogers and along the way he sings and dances and they dance together. Edward Everett Horton plays his manager and provides the comic relief. But who cares about the plot. We watch these movies for the songs and dancing and they are good. A highlight is Astaire's solo number in the steam room of the ship as he dances in time to the ship's pistons. There are some classic George Gershwin songs in this one: \"Let's Call The Whole Thing Off\" and \"They Can't Take That Away From Me\". \n\nThis is the 7th pairing of Astaire and Rogers. You can also see Astaire and Rogers in these films: Shall We Dance (1937) Swing Time (1936) Follow the Fleet (1936) Top Hat (1935) Roberta (1935) The Gay Divorc√©e (1934) Flying Down to Rio (1933)"
