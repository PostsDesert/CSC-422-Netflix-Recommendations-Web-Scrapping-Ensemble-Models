        "reviewBody": "This film spin-off from the MTV show featuring the archetypal juvenile slackers with an all-consuming passion for TV, rude words (\"huh, huh-huh, you said anus,\") and scoring with chicks (at which they are singularly unsuccessful) is pretty good considering the low level of the humour. The moronic duo wander through life completely unaware of both their innate doofishness and the trail of chaos they leave in their wake as they are mistakenly hired by a drunken low-life (voiced by Bruce Willis) to 'do' his sexy wife (Demi Moore) who has absconded with the macguffin they stole together. The genesis of Hank Hill from B&B creator Mike Judge's other show, King of the Hill, can be seen here in the character of Tom Anderson, a tourist who runs across Beavis and Butthead throughout the film. Anderson is older, but he bears a strong resemblance to Hill, and his voice is identical. There's a neat riff on monster movies at the start of the film, and a great satire of 70s cop shows during the credits, and while the jokes are mostly juvenile and silly, they're consistently amusing, which makes this film surprisingly funny and enjoyable."
