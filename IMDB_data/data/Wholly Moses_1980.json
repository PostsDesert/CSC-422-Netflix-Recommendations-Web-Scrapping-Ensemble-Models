He invited us to watch this movie because it just happened to be debuting on cable TV that week. One of my brother's friends said he was looking forward to watching John Ritter's cameo. We gathered around the TV and when the movie started, we found it to be so unfunny, we took turns sleeping through it. After the movie was over, the friend asked if John Ritter was even in the movie. I pointed out that Ritter was in the movie but since he had slept through his one scene, he missed Ritter entirely. I have nothing more to add."
