Accidentally joins the Peace Corp and learns the value of caring for others.\n\nSame self-centered womanizer tries to woo a pretty woman also in the Peace Corp. She rebuffs him and despises him. Later falls in love with same man.\n\nIt had its moments but was largely uninspiring. I wanted to like it because of Hanks and Candy but I think the movie is average at best.",
