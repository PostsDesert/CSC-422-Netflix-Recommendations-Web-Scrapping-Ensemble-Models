        "reviewBody": "This movie holds true to many people remember those high school days in which many of us teenage boys had a crush on certain female teachers we liked. Change it some put yourself in the shoes of a struggling calculus student who has his tough teacher climbing his neck and dreams of a college scholarship about to go in flames. Never fear an accident meeting with the sexy Tia Carrere who later turns out to be his teacher's wife! Not only does Tia take the young student through winning calculus training but a passionate romance develops. Only when the student has his teacher find out it all ends and a life lesson is learned and back to normal life. This movie shows that our fantasies can come true but they don't last and we must live our basic life. I watched this movie on USA one night late though it's not a great movie it's good due to the story and the beautiful Tia Carrere.",
