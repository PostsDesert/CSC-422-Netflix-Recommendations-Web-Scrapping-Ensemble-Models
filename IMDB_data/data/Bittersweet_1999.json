Sam tries to help the guard but Jed also shoots her and runs off with the loot. Sam does time but does not give Jed up. Four years later Sam is released and with the help of a maverick cop, Joe Massa (James Russo) they pursue Jed and his crime boss Mr Venti (Eric Roberts.)\n\nIt is an earnest, unpretentious and entertaining B movie that was straight to video. Everhart is easy on the eye, Wimmer and Roberts both chew the scenery leaving Russo to look moody. Some of the action scenes are ridiculous but it zips along.",
