Jeff uses a lot of time trying to find her,but after a while he gives up. After a while he gets contacted by a man who claims that he knows where Rita is and Jeff decides to go with him to find out.What he dont know is that this new guy is the kidnaper.\n\nJeff Bridges does an amazing job as the psycho Barney. This movie is so intense and well played that you have to take a break to breath.\n\nA really scary thriller about what can happen in real life.\n\nI gave it a 8 out of 10"
