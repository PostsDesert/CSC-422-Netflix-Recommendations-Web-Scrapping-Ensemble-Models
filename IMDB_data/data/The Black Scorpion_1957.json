        "reviewBody": "This little gem from Warner Brothers is actually a pretty good movie for it's time and genre. The basis of the story is that 2 scientists, one American, one Mexican, head to Mexico to study an erupting volcano. What they find however, is nest underground of huge scorpions that are terrorizing Mexico City. The special effects are good for the era, the scorpion drools and makes scary sounds. The acting is so-so, Richard Denning overacts at times, and the relationship with the ever lovely and B movie horror queen Mara Corday, is not well developed, and the little Mexican boy \"Juanito\" is nothing short of annoying. But overall the story works helped by the great special effects and the good storyline. A fun movie to watch on a rainy Saturday night.",
