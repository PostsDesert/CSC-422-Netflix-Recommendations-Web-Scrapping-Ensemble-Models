        "reviewBody": "For what I assume to be a failed pilot for a TV series, Hollywood Confidential follows a PI firm run by Edward James Olmos that takes on cases from the movers and shakers in Hollywood. Those sordid, dirty affairs meant to be kept under wraps. Frankly nothing here ever gets juicy or real sordid which made me think it's origins lay in television. Mini stories are introduced and then by the end resolved. Groundwork is set, characters are introduced. Keep an eye out for Rick Aiello (son to Danny) and a younger, but nevertheless sexy, Charlize Theron.\n\nCutting to the chase - the reason Hollywood Confidential doesn't work - it's boring. It presents this illusion that something worthwhile is going to happen, but nothing does. Most of the characters don't have any depth and the actual cases they work are either quick and boring or held back. Hollywood Confidential never does anything to distinguish itself. There's no style or edge to set it apart. Edward James Olmos is the best thing going on here. He's a better actor than this material honestly deserves.",
