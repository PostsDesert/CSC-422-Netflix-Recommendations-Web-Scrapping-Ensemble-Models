        "reviewBody": "Hey, I grew up on Cheech and Chong films. Yet amazingly I'm not a potsmoker today. This is probably the second best of the lot, closely following \"up in smoke\".\n\nIf you don't like Cheech Marin or Tommy Chong, this movie probably isn't for you. Although Cheech's recent work doesn't resemble his work with Chong. If you like Tommy Chong in that 70's show, you will most likely like this movie. And if you have any interest in Paul Reubins in his pre-pee wee herman years, this is the movie for you.\n\nThe story isn't much, but it has a semblance of a story to keep things moving fairly smoothly- unlike some other Cheech and Chong films. The gags and jokes work very well for the times, and hold up fairly well over time. This movie is less a variety show than later Cheech and Chong films. Although there are a couple sequences that don't seem to fit very well with the movie.\n\nThis movie is a must see for any fan of the drug culture. And most fans of that 70's show will probably like this movie.\n\nGo watch this movie and Up in Smoke now!!. You can skip other Cheech and Chong titles"
