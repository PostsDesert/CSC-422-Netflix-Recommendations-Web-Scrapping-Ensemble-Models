        "reviewBody": "Obviously made for an American audience who are just discovering martial arts films. Any experienced fan will like the archive footage but wonder why Crouching Tiger features so heavily and so many other seminal films are missing or barely mentioned. I'm also curious why in such a high quality production, some films, such as Jackie Chan's Drunken Master look like they were taped off a TV. The footage of the Shaw's Studio was fascinating as were the interviews, especially by Raymond Chow on Bruce Lee. But Tsui Hark features too much and Steven Seagal is interviewed but none of his films are even mentioned, nor van Damme. So like the proverbial curate's egg, good in bits but could have been so much better.",
