In addition to the whole 90's \"club\" environment (which many people may not be able to relate to), it's silly as hell. But I must say, in my opinion, A Night at the Roxbury deserves legendary status as a comedy. To be honest, I didn't think it was all that funny the first time I saw it, but much like the movie Austin Powers, it really grows on you after repeated viewing. I've seen it at nearly 20 times and I'm still not sick of it. I know at least a dozen people - friends and family members - who absolutely LOVE this movie, and I run into people all the time who say they love it as well. Okay, it may have initially tanked at the box office, but SURELY A Night at the Roxbury has accumulated enough profit through VHS and DVD sales to warrant a sequel. To the studio: please, for the love of god, MAKE A SEQUEL!!!"
