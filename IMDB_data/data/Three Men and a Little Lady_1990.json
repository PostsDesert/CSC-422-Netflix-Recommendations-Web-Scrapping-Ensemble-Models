        "reviewBody": "I really liked Three Men and a Baby and I really liked this film. To be honest, while there are those who will think it is better and those it is inferior, I actually put these two films equally. It could have been a tad shorter though, and there are one or two predictable parts, then again the first one did too. What I did like about Three Men and a Little Lady was its cuteness and charm. This is not the best movie I have ever seen, but it never tried to be, neither did it attempt to be better than the first. It was just an enjoyable movie, with one or two minor problems along the way. The scenery and cinematography was actually pretty lovely, and I liked the soundtrack too. The script was decent, the pacing was snappy, the story while predictable was entertaining and there were some funny sight gags and situations. The direction was neat, and the acting was fine. Robin Weisman is quite appealing as Mary, and Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg and Ted Danson were great together and individually. Also seeing Shiela Hancock is always a plus. Overall, cute and entertaining. 8/10 Bethany Cox",
