        "reviewBody": "I don't like musical videos with choreography (when a song is written, it's about lyrics and music not dancing!) and with pop stars cutting away from their audience.\n\nThis evolution is verified here: at the beginning of her career, Shania's videos are simple: she is casually dressed and she plays with common people: the time she achieved big sells, she is in fashion and her videos are highly sophisticated with no more next door people.\n\nShe is always reminded as the \"Country Queen\" but it means nothing to me as I can't stand labels: there is only two kind of music: good and bad! Sure, she has talent because \"Boots\", \"Woman in me\", and other songs are great but she doesn't bring the same emotional involvement than U2 or Natalie Imbruglia! Next to this compilation, came her \"UP\" album that made her go down because it's now a silence of 8 years! Maybe that's the difference: no one can claim to be an artist and not releasing anything in a decade! \n\nThus, Ciao Shania ! \n\nNB: the best video ever would be to shoot fans reactions when listening to the new single!",
