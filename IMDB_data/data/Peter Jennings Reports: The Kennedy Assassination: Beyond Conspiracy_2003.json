        "reviewBody": "The 3d emulation which all this movie is based on is quite impressive and visually interesting and fascinating. But this documentary is too poor of important elements. No words from the many witnesses, no investigation on the many photographs and other elements and mostly, denies the last shoot to JFK's has been done from a different angle than the book deposit. Who would like to get a better idea about what happened i suggest everyone to look for the movies \"the men who killed Kennedy\" by Nigel Turner. Around 10 hrs of informations, evidences and witnesses interview that can really give you more clues about JFK's assassination.",
