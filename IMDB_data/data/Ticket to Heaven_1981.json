        "reviewBody": "Based on the non-fiction book \"Moonwebs\" by Josh Freed, \"Ticket to Heaven\" is a gripping thriller about an unsuspecting young man who gets sucked into a \"religious\" cult, obviously the Unification Church (though not explicitly mentioned in the film).\n\nThere's very little time wasted with extraneous or slow scenes...hence you quickly feel the sense of foreboding as David first comes in contact with them and eventually is taken under their spell. The methods outlined in the film are truly insidious.\n\nGreat acting abounds, and most of the cast has gone on to have very successful acting careers (click on the links of the cast). An added surprise is a very young Kim Cattrall, who actually acts in this film, versus the vamping character for which she later become so well known.\n\nThere's a great laugh in the credits at the end, when they use the usual legal disclaimer that says \"all events and persons in the film are fictitious\". If only!"
