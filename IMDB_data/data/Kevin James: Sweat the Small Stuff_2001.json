These were things we could all relate to and that was what really made it funny. I really loved the line at the airport bit and the phone number rhythm thing was great. The DVD is hard to find but I would love to buy it. I have seen it several times on Comedy Central and could watch it again and again. The whole bit was really pretty clean so the whole family watched it. We can quote all of the jokes now but still love to watch it. Watching this made me a \"King of Queens\" fan.",
