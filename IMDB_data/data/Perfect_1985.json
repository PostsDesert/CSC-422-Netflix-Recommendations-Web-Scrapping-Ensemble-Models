        "reviewBody": "First, Travolta was great in this, far better than Urban Cowboy. The Laraine Newman arc is the theme to digest though. The 80's obsession with perfection has never been done this well because the movie still exploits the idea. It's hard to explain - it reminds me of American Psycho without the irony or violence. The movie is just as obsessed with hyping sex at the gym as the story in the story.\n\nI found this movie absolutely beautiful."
