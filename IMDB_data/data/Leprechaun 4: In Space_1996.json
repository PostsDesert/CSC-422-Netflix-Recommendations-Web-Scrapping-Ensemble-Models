If you pay attention to the dialogue, you will wonder who's retarded parrot threw these words together. As I watched this film, I slowly felt my brain trying to tear itself from my head. As the movie progressively burnt my flesh, I came to realize that there is no movie worse than Leprechaun 4. Save yourselves and don't see this movie!! Even the \"Behold my breasts and tremble\" scene doesn't make this movie worth it. Not so bad it's good, but so bad it is excrutiatingly painful to watch."
