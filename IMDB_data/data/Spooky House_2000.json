        "reviewBody": "Normally I don't bother with kid-oriented movies such as this, but I decided to watch this one because it was directed (and co-written) by William Sachs, whose previous movies have been mainly R-rated exploitation fare for adults. This sudden change in pace for Sachs may explain some of the problems in the finished product. The movie is somewhat too goofy for the most part, enough that even kids may be annoyed by the movie's low mentality. The story is pretty slow and stretched out (there are far too many plot threads), though oddly there are some moments here and there where footage seems to be missing. Also, the relatively low budget may explain why the movie often looks and feels like a television effort made for a network like Nickelodeon. \n\nOn the other hand, the end product does have some strengths. Ben Kingsley, as expected, gives a professional performance. He helps to make his character a multi-dimensional person and not a stereotype. And the scenes where he is paired up with child actor Matt Weinberg (who plays the orphan boy Max) generate some great chemistry. In fact, this part of the movie - the relationship between these two people - is without doubt the strongest part of the movie. \n\nI think the movie would have been a lot better had it instead focused on that aforementioned part of the movie instead of adding all that padding and juvenile nonsense. As it is, the movie is best suited for young kids only. Their parents, on the other hand, should have some reading material on hand."
