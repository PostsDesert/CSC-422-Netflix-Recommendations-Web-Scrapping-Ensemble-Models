First of all what makes them think that people would even believe they could be drug dealers, you in a group called \"B2k\" which means boys 2000, you just another commercial boy group, nothing hard about that. The street dancing make you hype, and what not, but all in all this movie, acting and concept wise, was horrible, and wasn't really worth the money I paid to see it.\n\nMy generation likes it because they are a group that everyone loves, but the truth is they need acting classes. All my friends said the acting was crap. I like the group hated their performance."
