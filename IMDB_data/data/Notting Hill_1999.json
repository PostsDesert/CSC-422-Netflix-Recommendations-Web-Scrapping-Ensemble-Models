        "reviewBody": "Notting Hill holds up more than two decades after its release in 1999. This utterly charming Cindafella daydream is one of the best romantic comedies to ever grace the big screen, with a perfect pairing of Roberts and Grant in the lead roles, backed by an equally spot on casting of the engaging supporting cast.\n\nThe film keeps things simple - Average Boy meets famous girl; Boy wins over girl; Boy loses girl; Boy wins back girl; Both live happily ever after (or at least long enough for the credits to roll). It's a classic tale, done with a deftly light touch, devoid of any complex tension - we know its going to end happily, because it's the dream many have despite knowing odds not in their favor, but this is a modern fairy tale - happy endings are required. Even if just a moment in time, perhaps that is enough for anyone to have a dream come true.\n\nAn all-time classic that has moved onto my Top 25 romantic comedies list.",
