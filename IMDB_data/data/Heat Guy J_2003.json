When I learned that the company that made it went under,I had to buy it,and I did.\n\nWhen I bought it: \n\nWhen I bought the entire collection from RightStuf.com,I loved it. It was the best,and never seen anything like it. The action in this show is excellent,and intense.\n\nCharacters: \n\nMy favorite characters in this show are:Daisuke,J,Boma, and the 3 girls Cynthia, Janis, and Vivian.\n\nMeaning of the show: \n\nWhat is series is also tells us is that having a partner through tough times can be helpful,and we must rely on one another.I do believe that Daisuke,and J make a good team,and of course having Boma on their team as an ally.\n\nBob Papenbrook,and Tony Pope:\n\nI also want to dedicate this series in memory of Bob Papenbrook,the voice of J. He was a great man for doing this series.And I will also dedicate this series in memory of Tony Pope.\n\nSo in closing,if you want to see something good,then see this show.It's the best.",
