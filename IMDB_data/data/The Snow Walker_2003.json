The producers went to great lengths to give accuracy as seen by the detailed mock up they had of the Norseman and the great amount of mosquitos encountered. To rate this movie in a low category would indicate to me that the commenter has had very little to do with wilderness survival in the high arctic. \n\nEven the crash details were reasonably accurate in that the floats on the aircraft had crumpled at the tips. The anger of the pilot after the crash is indicative of shock reaction in such and incident. His methods of survival versus her small fire and small shelter add to the realism of this movie.",
