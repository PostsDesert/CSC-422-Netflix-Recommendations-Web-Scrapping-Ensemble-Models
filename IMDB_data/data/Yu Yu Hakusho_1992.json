        "reviewBody": "Yu Yu Hakusho is one of the greatest anime shows I've ever seen. It's the story of a teenage spirit detective and his friends fighting the worst demons from spirit world. The animation's great, the music fits, it actually has a story, and the voice actors are phenomenal!! It's also has clever dialog, FUNimation really did a great job with this project. This show is fantastic all around!!! \n\nThis show really grabs your attention, for instance: (Before I knew about this show) I was in the kitchen finding myself something to eat, my brother was watching Yu Yu Hakusho and I could see the TV from the kitchen. I heard somebody yell \"Spirit Gun\" and I instantly looked up, forgot I was hungry then sat down and watched it. GREAT ANIME!!!!!",
