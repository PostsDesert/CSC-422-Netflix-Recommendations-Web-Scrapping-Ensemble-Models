Told in raw, direct and masterfull fashion, the stories of the elementary school located in inner city Philly is put on the screen as a testament to these children.\n\nI have never seen such hero's on the screen. The principal of the school must be one of the greatest and remarkable people on earth. The man teaching the first grade all male class is a true prophet and visionary of how we can escape the social problems of our day. He truly understands and with confidence administers more then his share of effort to heal our broken world.\n\nThink I'm sensationalizing this movie? Find this movie, watch it, and if you don't agree with me, I will personally send you what you paid to rent/buy this movie. It gave me a grim sense of the condition we are in as human beings, however at the same time displayed the key of hope to our future in children. A masterpiece.",
