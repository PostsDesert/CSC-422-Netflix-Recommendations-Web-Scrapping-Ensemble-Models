        "reviewBody": "Angie Dickinson was outstanding in this very comical, drama as (Wilma McClotchie) and her boy crazy daughters Danielle Briseboise(Billy Jean) and Julie McCullough(Polly). Robert Culp (Daryl Pearson) was a reporter who covered the wild and crazy bank robbers all over the countryside. Daryl even watched the daughters go skinny dipping in one scene and nearly had his head blown completely off. Angie Dickinson had lots of sparks and romance with Culp and nothing was left to your imagination. This film was a 4th of July fireworks with everything burning up in the END! This is a classic film for Angie Dickinson fans, a must see if you missed it.",
