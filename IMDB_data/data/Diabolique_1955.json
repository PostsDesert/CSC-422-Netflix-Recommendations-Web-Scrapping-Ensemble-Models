        "reviewBody": "Greetings from Lithuania.\n\n\"Diabolique\" (1955) is a really good mystery drama. It starts as a drama and then later some of the characters must done something horrible, but the true suspense comes after something very \"not according to a plan\" happens.\n\nI liked the performances in this movie. Directing and writing was also great, as well as the involving story. The ending was surprising as well.\n\nOverall, \"Diabolique\" isn't a horror movie as its genre description says - its a very solid mystery drama. It has involving story and it is very well done. Good movie overall.",
