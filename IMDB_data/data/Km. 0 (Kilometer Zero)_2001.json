A few times I could see around the corners of the script, but many times I was pleasantly surprised. There's not as much of the Madrid scenery as I would have liked to have seen as I've never been there. But beautiful faces made up for beautiful places.\n\nThe story line where the older woman meets a male prostitute was an interesting direction, though the results were obvious. The portion about the dancer and the man he meets didn't offer enough meat to be really compelling, so I couldn't give it a 10.\n\nRegardless of the flaws, it was just plain enjoyable. I really liked it a lot. Take this one home!",
