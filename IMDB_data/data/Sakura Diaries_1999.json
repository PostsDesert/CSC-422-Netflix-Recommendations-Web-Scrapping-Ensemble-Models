A WELL DONE ROMANTIC COMEDY!! This isn't one of those J-Lo movies, this romantic comedy is worth taking a look at.If your into anime as much as me, and i think you are you'll find sakura diaries a whole lot of fun and quite possible, a must buy for the anime collection.\n\nI give sakura Diaries.....\n\n10 out of 10"
