        "reviewBody": "Man, when you thought that stand up comedy could only be so funny, then this movie comes along! My God, this has to be one of the funniest stand up comedy movies around! Martin Lawrence does an excellent job keeping his audience laughing out of their seats with his combined mixture of racy jokes, including prison jokes (you know how those go...dropping the soap, etc.), racism, sex, and relationships. And boy, Lawrence holds-no-bars as he goes all out and is totally RAW and UNCENSORED (as you can tell because of the NC-17 rating). If you're chillin with a bunch of friends and you're looking to laugh your ass off, then this one will definitely do it for you. Check it out, but don't expect Blockbuster or Hollywood video to carry this 'bad boy'."
