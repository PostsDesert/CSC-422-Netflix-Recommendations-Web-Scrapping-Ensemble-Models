My favourite scene is where Marshall and Charlie switch bodies. The special effects are so good that it's totally realistic.\n\nHow they managed to make it look like Marshall was shrinking (making his clothes baggy) and Charlie was growing (and ripping his clothes to shreds at the same time-always a fave bit for me) I'll never know, but it was amazing."
