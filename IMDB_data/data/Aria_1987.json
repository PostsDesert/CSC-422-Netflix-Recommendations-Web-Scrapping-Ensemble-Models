        "reviewBody": "Okay, on one level, this movie stinks. Plot, substance, ability to keep one awake...fails. We are aware that 10 directors had their hands on this film but I don't believe it. I think John Derek (Bo Derek's \"Boloro,\" \"Tarzan the Ape Man,\" etc...) had directed it. I mean think about it...gorgeous naked women, great scenery, pleasant cinematography. This is a Derkesque film if there ever was one. On another level, the visuals are sometimes stunning. The scenery, location shots, nude women....very tasty. Elizabeth Hurley and Bridget Fonda (in their young and earliest performances) strut their naked selves which alone is worth the price of admission. The music and storylines suggest an endless sadness that never turns itself around. My suggestion, keep the sound off, fast forward to the scenes with nude women (lots of scenes so it's really a matter of fast forwarding over the few non-nude scenes), and enjoy. Guys directing gorgeous woman to get naked. If you are a guy, you got to love the film business."
