        "reviewBody": "\"If your thirsty and your gay, come on down and grab an ice cold Schmitt's Gay.\" Saturday Night Live: The Best of Adam Sandler is truly hilarious. This is among one of my favorite Saturday Night Lives one man shows. Before all of his movies like Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, or The Waterboy he did Saturday Night Live. This is dead on hilarious and his best sketches are The Denise Show, Canteen Boy, Grandma, Schmitt's Gay, Zegart's, the store where the transexuals were, The Herlihy Boy, and more. Overall, this is one of the funniest SNL's that I have ever seen and Adam Sandler and Chris Farley are hilarious! I highly recommend it.\n\nHedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+",
