All are either directly or obliquely (sometimes very obliquely indeed) about AIDS. None are exceptional. I have been known to enjoy DVD collections of short gay-themed films. If some of them are not very good, at least I enjoy the different perspectives that filmmakers bring in their examination of what it means to lead a gay life. For me, none of these films was remotely interesting. If you are looking for some smart, sexy, French short films, rent the collection of François Ozon's short films that has been released to DVD.",
