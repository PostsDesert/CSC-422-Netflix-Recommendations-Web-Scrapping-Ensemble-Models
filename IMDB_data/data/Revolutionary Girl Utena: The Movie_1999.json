        "reviewBody": "The first time I saw this movie, my eyes nearly popped out of my head. I'm a great fan of the TV series, but the movie was really another thing entirely. The new character designs were just a bit startling, especially in the case of Anthy. Everyone's hair is longer, with the exception of Akio. (I wonder why they cut his cool little ponytail off.)\n\nThe visuals in this movie were stunning, just as much or more so than in the show, especially the dance scene. Like the art, the music was really entrancing. 'Toki Ni Ai Wa' is now one of my favorite songs, both to sing and to listen to.\n\nAlthough it looks fantastic, Adolescence Mokushiroku really isn't for someone who hasn't seen the series. It's very emotional in some parts, and in many places incredibly bizarre. Even to those who've seen the movie, some of it just makes no sense. Still, it's one of my favorite movies."
