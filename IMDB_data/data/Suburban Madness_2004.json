I was interested in more of the Blue Moon clients and other cases, as well as more about why Bobbi Bacha became a PI and a mother of three. I think the series would be excellent. We loved watching Sela Ward on the tractor following the cheatin Husbands. It was great.\n\nThe Harris story was tragic and Elizabeth Pena gave her character humanity, you could understand that Brett Cullen (David Harris) was leaving Clara because she was over controlling. \n\nIt was amazing to watch Bacha's daughter Cassie get married despite her father being a cheater, her mother catching cheaters and Clara Harris killing a cheating husband.\n\nIt makes me wonder why women even put themselves through marriage. \n\nWould love to see Sela playing Bacha on a weekly basis. I can even see the Desperate Housewives calling Bacha to follow their husbands and kids.",
