Because it's unabashedly everything her other 'cute' movies play at doing; because Tim Robbins is simply brilliant; because Einstein's friends are so good; because Tony S is nothing short of brilliant; and because Walter Matthau is perhaps the real star.\n\nThere are memorable quotes you will read about in this section, but they don't really work unless you see them being delivered.\n\nThis is only a romp, and it's only for fun, but it has a strong underlying message delivered by Matthau towards the end.\n\nIt's very well acted; and if you think Ryan's character is a bit unreal, fine: it is. But that's what you get for the price of admission."
