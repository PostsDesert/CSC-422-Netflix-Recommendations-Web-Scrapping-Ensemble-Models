The gunfighting scenes are really good, mostly because they are very silent - the assassins both use silencers, which adds new flavor to a well-used dish. I like that part very much. And Banderas is great to watch as usual. There simply isn't anyone with his mimics and his body language anywhere else. Stallone does a good job too, actually. And Julianne Moore, yeah well - who could say anything bad about her?\n\nEntertaining, fast-moving - and please! Check out that gunfight again.",
