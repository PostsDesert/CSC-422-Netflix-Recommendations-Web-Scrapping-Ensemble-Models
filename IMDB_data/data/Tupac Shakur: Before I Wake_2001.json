I recommend that all of the true Tupac fans read the book and check out the Documentary \"Before I Wake\" I've seen this movie and it's truly as good as the book due to the fact I've read the book and all the facts are so consistent to one another. I can't wait until one day the book is turned into the movie...I'm truely a Tupac fan and I can't tell you how this movie and the book has helped me understand what happen to the GREATEST RAPPER of our time! Tupac may you be in heaven and may God Bless your Soul one day we'll meet again...UR HOME BOY!",
