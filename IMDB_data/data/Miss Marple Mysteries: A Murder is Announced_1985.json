        "reviewBody": "I can understand why many people see this as the best of Joan Hickson's adaptations. The production values are so high, the casting director did a fantastic job and got every characterisation spot on. ITV's remake I did enjoy and compares well with this one, partly because it moves at a pace. This version is far more intricate, more detailed and of course more true to the novel. Joan Hickson was of course born to play Miss Marple, to this day I don't think anyone catch match her, she was incredible. It's funny, I was 5 when this was transmitted, and I have a vivid memory of the scene where Miss Murgatryod is strangled with her washing, think that's why I was so keen to watch them again (and again.) As with all Agatha Christie's it's the endings I enjoy, and this is one of the best, if you've not seen it, you are missing out. Ursula Howells, Renee Asherson and Paola Dionisotti are particularly brilliant. a definite no questions asked 10/10",
