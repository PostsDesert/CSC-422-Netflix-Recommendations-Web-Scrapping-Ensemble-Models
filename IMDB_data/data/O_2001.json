        "reviewBody": "Mekhi plays the only black basketball player in an all-white high school. Julia Stiles portrays his (dumb) white girlfriend, Desi. Josh Hartnett is Hugo, and he is obsessed with Odin, who his coach dad likes better than him. I watched the one with Lawrence Fishburne, and read the cliff notes last year for class (I'm busy, not stupid!), and the one big difference between this movie and the play is how the characters are written. In the play, Iago (Hugo) is not very emotional or weak. He hates Othello for unknown reasons, and vows to destroy him. In O, Josh Hartnett plays him as somewhat vulnerable and confused. He is motivated mostly by his father's indifference, but a lot of his actions are left ambiguous. He hates and loves Odin, instead of just hating him. The last lines are about him. The story is told mostly from Hugo's oint of view, and compared to the original, Othello is insecure and not very \"noble.\" He's really just a normal kid, but obviously had some kind of complex, and the drugs Hugo gave him made it worse."
