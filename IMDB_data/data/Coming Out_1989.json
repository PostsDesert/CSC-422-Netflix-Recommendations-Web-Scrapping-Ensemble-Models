None of the gay themed films I saw described better the problems and relations in our community. This East Germany film was very important for me, because, back in those times, I saw myself in the role of the main character. Being afraid of being myself and how to deal with it - that is the idea of the film. It wants to say to all of \"us\", and I would quote here one of my first boyfriends: \"No matter what the world thinks about you, do what makes you happy.\" Really, that is what matters. You and the other one. This movie helped me a lot. And I am not afraid of being myself anymore.",
