        "reviewBody": "This is truly a Fantasy/Comic movie-masterpiece. First of all- the excellent cast- Jack Nicholson shines in the role of the manic and crazy Jocker. Nicholsons character is truly amazing- like a mixture of his former roles/characters in \"Chinatown\" (Jake Gittes), \"One Flew Over the Cuchoo`s Nest\" (Randle McMurphy), \"Prizzie` s honor\" (C.Partanna), \"the Witches of Eastwick\" (Daryl Van Horn) and of course \"The Shining\" (Jack Torrance)- but (the character) still keeps his own style. Michael Keaton also proves to be the ideal type for Burtons`s Batman. He reminds on the dark Batman from the \"Dark Knight\" Batman comics, and is the exact opposite of Batman introduced by Adam West in the 70`s. Second, Tim Burton created a unique athmosphere, exactly matching to the characters. Some people say that this movie is to dark, but I wouldn`t agree. I must not forget to mention the exciting Batman Theme composed by Danny Elfmann. Burton`s Batman, differnt from all the other Comic-hero movies, like Spiderman, Superman, Flash or Hulk, provides a refreshing character dimension.\n\nOne of the best movies in the 80`s.",
