        "reviewBody": "By far my favourite of the Pippi movies. Contains some of the greatest comic actors in Sweden - Martin Ljung and Jarl Borssén. And the most beloved \"teddy bear\" actor/comic/writer who was loved by all; Beppe Wolgers. He was just as good with kids as is implied by his hearty report with his \"daughter\" as Efraim Långstrump. And I love the songs.\n\nUnfortunately all of the Astrid Lindgren movies/TV series suffers horribly from being co produced with Germany. Even the Swedish versions are dubbed as some actors are German/danish or whatever... And this shows now when you are an adult. It really don't change my love for them as they are a big part of our cultural heritage (Lindgren is still BIG :D). But to vote them down is kinda silly. Technically they are low budget -but what 70's films aren't? Even Star Wars was a low budget flick - but they changed the concept of FX totally.. :)",
