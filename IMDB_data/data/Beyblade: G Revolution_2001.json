I know a lot of people say its bad and the Japanese version is far superior but its good how they change the show to suit our culture, making it easier for children (their main audience) to understand. The other review says its repetitive but what sport isn't? This was as big as Pokemon and Dragon ball Z at my school, everyone loved it. People say it was only to sell toys, well it did that and it did it good. What kid doesn't want to be a part of something that can save the world like in a TV show. The people who say it isn't very good are usually older people who come across the show while channel surfing, the show isn't aimed at you so its not fair to hate it.",
