        "reviewBody": "An incredible performance by Peter Frampton and his band Live in Detroit Michigan. Many favorites including a few newer songs. The sound quality and video on this DVD is how ALL music DVD's should be produced. Superior quality and sound that makes this DVD a must have for any collector. Frampton's performance is spot on and exceptional. His rendition of \"Do You Feel Like I Do\" is even better than on his \"Frampton Comes Alive\" double album. Even the extras on this DVD are truly informative and interesting to any music aficionado. From beginning to end, Frampton clearly shows he hasn't lost his musical spark nor his guitar skills that made him infamous in the 70's and 80's.",
