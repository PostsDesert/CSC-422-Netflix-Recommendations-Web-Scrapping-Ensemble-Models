        "reviewBody": "The original 1969 film offered something different. Set mostly in Turin-Italy the film is about a group of clumsy English villains who set out to grab a stash of gold bullion during transit. They find themselves up against it with both the Mafia and the Italian authorities. Much of the film is very typically British from the cast and their accents to the Austin Mini cars (red, white and blue with GB stickers on the back!).\n\nThis is one of the few films I can think of that doesn't have a happy ending but it does have the feel good factor and an excellent cliff hanger to boot. When viewed today it obviously lacks some of the refinements we have come to expect from the typical Hollywood blockbuster, some of the acting and camera shots are laughable. However 35 years on it still hold it's own and has many merits including...\n\nGood music Lovely cars 60's Fashion Stunning backdrops Good stunts Original and plausible plot Memorable cliff hanger\n\nA very British film with plenty of character 8/10\n\nThe new film is very different to the original movie. In fact most of the good features that the original had going for it were lost. In it's place is a blatant marketing exercise for the new BMW mini mixed in with some good but uninspiring action sequences. The new film starts in Italy but then moves to the U.S. which for me misses the point slightly. I found that the plot involving the traffic light control method used in the new film to be rather geeky and unbelievable at best (another feature that worked better in the old film).\n\nDespite it's faults the film contains some nice action sequences and is watchable (although one viewing is more than enough).\n\nIf I hadn't already seen it all before, by itself this might be a great film. However I have and this isn't. 5/10"
