Sometimes I thought it was the worst piece of garbage I've ever seen, made by Satan himself; other times I laughed my head off and thought it was one of the most entertaining-yet-stupid films I'd ever seen. Finally, the first part won out and I got rid of it....but it was fun while it lasted.\n\nJennifer Tilley, one of the all-time low-life-character-playing actresses in Hollywood along with Jennifer Jason-Leigh, complete with ditsy voice and humongous breasts with cleavage that meteors could get lost in, is the star here along with the demonic doll \"Chucky,\" who never seems to go away. \n\nSo.....a few questions: How many years now have we seen this little guy and how many times does he have to die? In many movies does Tilley have to use just for another chance to flaunt her boobs?\n\nThis movie is so bad it has to be considered \"camp.\" It's more comedy than horror, although both are there in abundance. You can't take any of this seriously. \n\nThe movie is simply incredibly sleazy and yet incredibly funny at times, and dumb, and......you name it."
