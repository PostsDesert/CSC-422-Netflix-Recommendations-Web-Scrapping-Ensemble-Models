Those movies where Farley was in the leading role can't even compare to this Saturday Night Live compilation film of Chris Farley. He will definitely be missed.\n\nIf for some reason you didn't enjoy some of Farley's \"newer\" stuff, check out this film because it is absolutely hilarious. This is Chris Farley at his best. I have watched this film over 20 times already, and the \"bill swerski's super fans\" skit cracks me up every time. Highly recommended.",
