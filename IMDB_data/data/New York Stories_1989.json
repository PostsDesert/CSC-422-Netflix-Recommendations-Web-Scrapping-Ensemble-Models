        "reviewBody": "This film is quite fascinating-in parts. My best advice to anyone renting it is to sit back and thoroughly enjoy the first segment by Martin Scorsese (\"Life Lessons\")-although you may be sick of \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" by the end of it, or you may have a new reason to love it. Then, I suggest you fast forward through the painful middle story by Francis Ford Coppola. I really tried to like it, seeing as how this was the same man who brought us \"The Godfather.\" Alas, even I couldn't sit through it. Then, watch Woody Allen's very funny \"Oedipus Wrecks.\" This short film, like Albert Brooks' \"Mother\" will have you going, \"My God, it's Mom!\" A satisfying rent. Try to get the people at Blockbuster to knock fifty cents off the price for not watching the middle part."
