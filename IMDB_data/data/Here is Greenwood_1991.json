        "reviewBody": "This may be a little biased because the only copy available for me was the dubbed version. Simply put, the dub was horrible. The characters, having flat, monotonous voices, prevented me from enjoying this series entirely. I've more than a few complaints about Greenwood but I emphasize these points. 1. why do every character look the same? Except for different hair color (umm pink for guys?) the students look nearly identical. 2. how unrealistic is it for a guy to be living with a girl in a dorm? If this is a Japanese tradition then I'm not aware of it. I suggest watching the first episode, subbed if you possibly can, if it doesn't interest you, dump the series all together and watch some Nadesico.",
