If you want to see explorers running away from a tyrannosaurus rex or from velociraptors as the cover indicates, you will be disappointed. \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\" is not a film about dinosaurs. There are a few dinosaurs in it, but they're just a minor, almost unimportant subplot. The film revolves more around explorers in a prehistoric world deep underground making friends and relations with a tribe of primitive humans who are at war with a race of humanlike reptiles called Sauroids. The film was made on a limited budget, as one can tell by its at times, bad graphics. But what it does manage to do is to become entertaining with a well-acted cast, at times silly dialogue, fun action sequences, and is overall, a film that is just as long as it should be, at least for me.",
