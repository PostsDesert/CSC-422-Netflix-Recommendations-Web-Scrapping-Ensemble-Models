        "reviewBody": "'Divine Trash' is a documentary about the life and career of visionary cult director John Waters. To be honest, it is a documentary about his earlier career until the release of 'Pink Flamingos'. His later career is touched only briefly. I like that the movie concentrated more on his earlier life - how John Waters became the artist he is known today. What inspired him in his childhood, and his adolescence? Footage from his earlier films, interviews with the cast and crew. Behind the scenes footage. Pure gold.\n\nBesides the interviews with filmmakers who were inspired by John Waters, there were also interviews with journalists, film historians, and even psychologists. A nice touch was the interviews with the lady from the film censorship board. I liked that the documentary didn't try to turn her into some kind of a villain. She was just a Christian lady who didn't like these sort of movies. The interviews with the parents of John Waters, and with the mother of Divine were sweet. It was nice to learn that, although they had never seen 'Pink Flamingoes' they all were supportive of their children's choices.\n\nThis documentary is timeless and a must-see for any John Waters fan (although, they probably already know everything). And not only - actually anyone deeply interested in the film has to see that documentary. Yes, it is that important of a movie.",
