        "reviewBody": "This movie only got one thing right: Christmas sucks. Eerything else was horribly wrong. It looked like a 3rd grader shot it and came off as extremely low budget. The acting was completely unremarkable, as was the character development. Also, it was completely unbelievable that the social worker Alex took a case when she knew the client was her lover's brother. This was a complete conflict of interest and no ethical social worker would ever do that. it just contributed even more to the stupidity of the movie and of the characters. The portrayal of a dysfunctional alcoholic, dry, new england family was very accurate however, but still not enough to give it more than one star. I can't believe this movie won awards, or that I wasted an hour and thirty-two minutes watching it. I'm writing this review to save others the trouble.",
