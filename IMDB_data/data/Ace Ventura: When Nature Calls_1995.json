Though, gotta give it that: The movie is still pretty funny, which, however, is expected of a comedy movie.\n\nEven though this movie is a tad longer than the first part, I just could not find myself puzzle over the (admittedly rather Indiana-Jones-like) case this time, whereas I had much fun doing that over the case in the first one. Simply put: No suspense whatsoever in this one.\n\nAs stated above, though, I did have to laugh quite a few times at the jokes presented in 'Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls', which is not the only good thing (of course). This movie does still have an interesting story, which I believe to be quite surreal compared to the first movie, though that adds some more ridiculous vibe to this comedic title.\n\nSummarizing, there is only one thing left to say: If you solely watch this movie for the comedic purpose, you shall have a great time!",
