        "reviewBody": "Based on the novella \"The Turn of the Screw\" by Henry James, a young governess (Deborah Kerr) for two children becomes convinced that the house and grounds are haunted.\n\nAs outsiders looking in as voyeurs, we are left wondering about what the governess sees: are the children possessed? Or perhaps they have become friends with ghosts? Or is the governess simply paranoid? The film keeps us guessing, which only adds to its creepiness.\n\nThis title has the distinction of featuring the debut of Pamela Franklin, here playing the child Flora, who would later be memorable in \"The Legend of Hell House\". She expertly presents herself as innocent (hence the title) while saying creepy lines such as, \"Oh, look, a lovely spider! And it's eating a butterfly.\" Did this inspire Jack Hill's \"Spider Baby\"? \n\nThe film has received wide critical acclaim for its psychological thrills and also its technological achievements (cinematographer Freddie Francis made the lightning his number one focus, and also shot the film in layers, giving it a deeper look than most movies). No less than Martin Scorsese has listed it among the greatest horror films ever made.\n\nFreddie Francis is in top form here, coming off his Oscar win for \"Sons and Lovers\" (1960). His mark on the horror genre would only increase in the following years, as he took the director's chair for Amicus and Hammer numerous times in the 60s and 70s.",
