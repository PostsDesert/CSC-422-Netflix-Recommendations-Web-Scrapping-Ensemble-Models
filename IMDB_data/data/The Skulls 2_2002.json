The really unfortunate thing is that the script actually stood a chance, but the flick itself went into the dumper the first five minutes and never recovered. Just to begin with, what is with all the beautiful people in the same place at the same time...? Is this like a Baywatch Goes to College movie? Then there's all the \"secret societies\" on the campus of this college. Does anyone ever go to class, or do they just run around in robes, hosing beautiful coeds wearing bras that push their boobs up under their chins? Then this \"secret society\" passes out rulebooks with the person's name on it that owns it? Gee, there's a really brilliant idea. I don't say this often, but I truly feel as if I've been robbed of 99 minutes of my life I'll never get back.",
