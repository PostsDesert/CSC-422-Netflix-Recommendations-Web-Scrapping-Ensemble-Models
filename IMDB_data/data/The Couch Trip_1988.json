I wasn't expecting much, so it came as a big surprise that I loved it so much.\n\nThis is the type of film that Dan Aykroyd seems to love to make. A chance for him to 'ham it up' and not take things too seriously. If you loved him in The Blues Brothers or Ghostbusters you'll know what I mean, and you'd be wise to check out The Couch Trip.\n\nAvid fans of Aykroyd will also have fun spotting all the tiny links to his other films in the script!\n\nI can't describe this film without spoiling it for you, so all I can do is tell you to check it out. I can't praise this film highly enough, and it must surely be time for a DVD release!!",
