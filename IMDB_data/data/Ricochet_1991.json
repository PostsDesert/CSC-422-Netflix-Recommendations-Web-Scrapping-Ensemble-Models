Lithgow plots revenge while incarcerated and breaks out violently at his parole hearing.\n\nHe turns the tables on Washington in several ways including the killing of his friend and fellow officer, nice played by Kevin Pollak. Washington is blamed for the killing. He kidnaps Denzel and shoots drugs into his system and provides him with a prostitute.\n\nThe two eventually tangle on top of a high area before the obvious ending occurs.\n\nA good story allowed to go awry by crazy staged events.",
