        "reviewBody": "Now, I would have given it a ten, but I've only seen the first episode and drama's normally cannot achieve a ten and I doubt they ever will. \n\nThe good: This is one of the only drama's that aren't over dramatic, most over dramas have them overreacting to everything which is stupid and pointless. But in the flesh captures the drama genre perfectly like no other drama could ever do. \n\nThe action is spectacular and fresh, it's not everyday you see a zombie drama is it? This one just get's the job done just right.\n\nThe lighting sets a great effect that really capture the atmosphere of it all.\n\nThe storyline is also superb and strong.\n\nIt's very unique of how the zombies can be good if they aren't rabid!\n\nThe bad: Only 3 episodes, now this is one of the only bad points. It isn't so bad but I would love it to be at least six part drama.\n\nCan be sometimes confusing, like sometimes you won't know what's going on. Like some people won't know what a rotter is. \n\n9/10 it's an amazing drama that is worth checking out.",
