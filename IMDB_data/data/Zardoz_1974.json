        "reviewBody": "This movie is truly awful, but at the same time it's got to be one of the BEST SCI-FI MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN!\n\nThere are so many concepts to digest: Civilization's end, immortality, genetic manipulation, artificial intelligence, time control, psychic power, space travel, and on and on and on. If you're the least bit interested in science-fiction, there's more for you in this one movie than you'll find in a year's worth of Star Trek conventions!\n\nThen why do I say it's awful? Well, within this movie's running time are some of the most cheesy moments ever captured on celluloid!\n\n From the opening shots of the hairy-backed, leather-thonged, gun-toting Sean Connery (who at least manages to wear more than most of the rest of the cast), to the catch-cry of the Giant Hovering Stone Head (\"The gun is good! The penis is bad!\"), as it spews out a torrent of weapons and ammo from its mouth. What about the Eternal's predilection for studying erectile tissue function, by flashing up images of naked mud-wrestling? Or that crazy \"wobbling-hands\" thing that they do when in some sort of telepathic communion? Completely laughable!\n\nDespite these moments of \"cheesy-ness\", Zardoz tells an utterly engaging and compelling story. The moment of revelation of the meaning of \"Zardoz\" took me completely by surprise, even though all the clues had been under my nose right from the beginning! (The Magritte painting \"La chateau des Pyrenees\", hanging in Frank's house, reminiscent of the hovering stone head, for example.)\n\nIf you like hard-core science fiction, and can put up with a few minor flaws, then I think you'll really enjoy Zardoz! It's weird, it's brilliant, it's unique! (Just make sure you watch it while you're wide awake, though, or you may drift off from time to time!)\n\n9 out of 10!\n\njon :-)",
