Most fairy tales, including those in this series, features creatures and humans from Europe. They've revised them to be from around the world: Africa, South America, Mexico, Asia, etc: places the producer feel are not sufficiently represented by typical fairy tales that we tell our children, and Disney.\n\nI think it would have been better to focus on the fairy tales those cultures already have as opposed to reworking good stories and essentially ruining them with badly written music and sloppy directing/voice work.",
