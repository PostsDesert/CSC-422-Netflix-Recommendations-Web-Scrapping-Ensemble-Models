If you have seen West Wing or Sports Night you'll fell right at home with this wonderful miniseries.\n\nInstead of the White house or a TV Show, here we go behind the scenes of a Typical \"mecha\" squadron, with all the comedy, drama and romance that it involves.\n\nThe characters are mostly wonderful, the story is charming and it masterfully blends romantic comedy and drama, while avoiding to emphasize on the battle scenes or the threat against humanity.\n\nGreat show. I'm really happy that I bought this. I only hope another season it's on the way."
