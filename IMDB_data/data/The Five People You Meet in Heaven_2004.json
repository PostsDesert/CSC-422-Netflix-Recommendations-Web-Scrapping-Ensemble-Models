        "reviewBody": "This film is about a man's journey in heaven after he dies. He meets five people in heaven, each teaching him different things that he never knew or understood before.\n\nI have read the book and was deeply touched by it. This film stays very true to the book. The film is basically a direct adaptation of the book, translating every single line of the book into audiovisual material. The end result is that there are many dialogs and scenes that simply do not work in the film. I feel that there are so many scenes that can be cut, and so many dialogs that can be omitted in the film. For example, it does not hurt the film at all if the captain does not ask if the army boys kept in touch with each other. Or the interspersed childhood scenes, which if omitted, will make the film flow more seamlessly.\n\nThis is not to say that the film is not good. It is very good, the sets are meticulously created, the acting is great, and the film is touching. My only complaint is that it is too long. Spending 40 minutes on the second person and another 40 minutes on the third person is simply too long."
