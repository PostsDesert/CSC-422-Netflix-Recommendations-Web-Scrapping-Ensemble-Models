        "reviewBody": "Well, let's just be blunt and say that \"Summer Holiday\" (aka \"Ha yat dik mo mo cha\") pretty much is the epitome of romantic comedies to make it from the Hong Kong cinema in the 2000s.\n\nSure, \"Summer Holiday\" was watchable and enjoyable enough for what it turned out to be. However, it was just a bit too mundane and generic for my liking. It was like watching essentially any other romantic comedy of that era. As such, \"Summer Holiday\" from writer Susan Chan and director Jingle Ma just failed to stand out amidst a tsunami of likeminded romantic comedies.\n\nThe storyline, whilst being very generic, was salvaged by the cast, which included the likes of Sammi Cheng and Richie Jen, whom also were much akin to the 2000s of Hong Kong movies.\n\nIf you enjoy romantic comedies, then \"Summer Holiday\" is well worth watching, and even more so if you have an interest in the Hong Kong cinema. However, if you watch this movie for the entertainment value and don't have any particular interest in the romantic comedy genre, then this is by no means an outstanding movie.\n\nMy rating of \"Summer Holiday\" is a mediocre five out of ten star. Yeah, it was watchable, but it was just like any other random romantic comedy.",
