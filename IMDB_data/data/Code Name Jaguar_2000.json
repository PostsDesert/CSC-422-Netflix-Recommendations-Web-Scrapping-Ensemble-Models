The director, Maurice Labro made one year before, a better Bond imitation, \"Coplan prend des risques\", with the beautiful Virna Lisi as a Coplan(the French equivalent of Bond) girl. Ray Danton, former Sandokan, was good at remaining Sandokan and not trying to mimic Sean Connery. The charm of Wolfgang Preiss and Charles Regnier (both formerly in Mabuse) and Horst Frank, does not save the cheap script. Pascale Petit is too petite(small, in French) for sex appeal. And Roger Hanin, I never liked him in anything.",
