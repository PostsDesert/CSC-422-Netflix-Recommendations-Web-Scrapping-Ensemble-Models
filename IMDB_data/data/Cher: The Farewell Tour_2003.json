Unfortunately all of us die hard Cher fans must face the true and upseting fact that Cher is saying goodbye to the Touring world.\n\nAll of the tears aside, this is definitely a perfect way to go out with a bang!!!! Her incredible stage performance, beautiful costume changes, her connection with her audience, and her true way of just being....well....CHER!!! The original Diva will always be a hit in the music world! Twenty years from now people will still be jamming to Cher, because everybody knows her name, her truthfulness and her attitude that the world can look at her and either take it or leave it!\n\nThis is definitely a DVD or Video to add to your collection!! Cher performs all of her hits and includes a tear jerking medley of The Sonny & Cher Show performances of The Beat Goes On, Baby Don't Go, and I Got You Babe. It shows Cher for who she really is and tributes her in a way that Britney, J.Lo., Christina, and all the rest will never be able to achieve!!! So out of pure honor and love, I would like to say, in the words of Cher herself, to all the young female artists out there.....\n\n \"FOLLOW THIS YOU BITCHES!!!!!!\" -Cher\n\n ~*Annie Rose*~",
