I must say it was entertaining, well written and extremely well acted.\n\nThe funny part is that the whole movie *also* has an \"indie\" aura that's supposed to be in the film thats being filmed.\n\nVery good acting. The only actor that doesn't really \"fit\" is the plumber. He has a cultural level WAY above I would guess 95% of NY Plumbers. But besides that, all the rest is very good.\n\nEven though it's not a *great* movie, it surely is way above 70% of what's being made today.\n\nI would expect more fine screenplays from the same author...\n\nNice and entertaining...",
