        "reviewBody": "This movie was a favorite of mine as a child, however looking back on it you can see certain flaws in it. The murder mystery is not much of a mystery and the jokes just are not quite as funny in some areas for me as an adult as they were when I was a kid. Though the one where the dog leaps into the bathtub is still rather funny. The movie has a private eye (at least I think he was a private eye) murdered. During a trip to heaven he is given the opportunity to come back to Earth and try to find the person responsible for his death. Of coarse, he comes back as Benji one of those dogs from the old days on the same page as Lassie and other famous canines. Funny thing is that Benji in this one is supposed to be a male dog, but is actually a female, while Lassie is always supposed to be a female, but is always a male dog. Well the dog soon ends up in the care of an attractive woman who takes the dog in, but may be another target for the killer. Like I said it worked for me as a kid and some of the stuff probably would still be somewhat humorous today. However, the film is most certainly dated as it looks older than a lot of other movies from this era of film and the murder scene is a tad gruesome for a PG rated film that is a bit marketed for families.",
