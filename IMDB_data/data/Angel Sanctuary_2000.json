        "reviewBody": "Angel Sanctuary is one of those shows that makes people uncomfortable intentionally by twisting around common perceptions. Some people may not like this, but if you approach this anime with an open mind and don't intend to be offended or disgusted, chances are you won't be. Graphically, the show is masterfully done and the blantant, almost disturbingly inverse plot makes it both a wonderful and frightening experience. As far as I can see, it's good to look at things from all sides and to see things from a very rare point of view- for example, from the point of view of a teenage boy in love with his biological sister rather than through the eyes of the masses- and this quality makes Angel Sanctuary both unique and thought-provoking.",
