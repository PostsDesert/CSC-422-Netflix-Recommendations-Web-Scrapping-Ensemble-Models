Sometimes real life is more interesting than any big budget Hollywood blockbuster.\n\nThe children are endearing as much as it is heartbreaking to see their hardship. You will cry your eyes out at seeing how much they go through and deal with in life. If you know anyone who feels sorry for themselves they need to see this. \n\nI cannot judge their mother to be in it just for the money since you couldn't give me enough to go through all that she does. I could see the love they had for each other in every frame. It was nice to learn so much about such a family and their unique and often overlooked plight. \n\n If anyone is going to put this on the market reserve me a copy!"
