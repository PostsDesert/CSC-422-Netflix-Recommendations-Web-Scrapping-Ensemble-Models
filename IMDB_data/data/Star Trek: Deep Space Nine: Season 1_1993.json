        "reviewBody": "As a writer I appreciate this Star Trek series more than all the others, the sheer intricacies of the various weaves of character's lives is beyond the imagination and follows the Vulcan Idic like no series ever did before nor after. One constant of life is death,and deep space nine never tries to take you to far away from that simple reality,it doesn't hide in the points of view made, it's the braver series by far in terms of writing, mainly because it shatters the perfect veneer ,that most fans have, Star Trek does speak as a whole for a better future for humanity, but the galaxy is a huge place, with cultures beyond the count, and one day hopefully we will make contact, but in the meantime ds9 reminds us that while earth has become a paradise, maybe other places in the universe are struggling to reach theirs , life is not all sunshine and roses at least not yet, but this series offers more insight into the various races of Star Trek like no other series ever did, the depths they went to is in part a clue to the sheer brilliance of its writing, the interpersonal relationships that develop along the way seem almost a natural happenstance of real people put together in a real place ,such is the quality, sadly never to be repeated in my life time, the talents of the actors that portray this side of the trek universe do so with such passion ,it sells you , so if your ready to take the trip do so, but do it with eyes open ,there are more prospectives to learn from than just the great bird of the galaxy's , overall personally I believe that as a writer Gene Roddenberry would be proud that his creation both inspired others to write and to make other people think as an end result, Star Trek has taken on a life of its own , but of deep space nine I would simply say chun dol go dan√° , (to boldly go) and added it's own colour to the ever.growing tapestry started 50 years ago.",
