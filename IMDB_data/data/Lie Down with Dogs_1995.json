I don't think anything from 60s hand-held-projects ever looked so cheap and stupid.\n\nI understand Wally White did the up-and-coming filmmaker finance-thing by charging a lot of this movie's expenses to his credit cards.\n\nI'd like to think he has to repay this cinematic exercise in futility over the course of his life - but I don't think the budget for this train-wreck could possibly top $10,000."
