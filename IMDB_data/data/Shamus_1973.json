Burt, as he did in this film, would sleep with any girl that came along. In one scene, Reynolds enters a bookstore, sees the clerk has a \"nice pair of boobs,\" so they have sex immediately right at the store. Only in the sleazy '70s of Hollywood! (Or in most men's dreams.)\n\nActually, Burt excelled in films that combined action and humor, which this has but not enough to make this one of more-remembered movies. However, it does have very little nudity despite the above paragraph and no blasphemy. The best part of the movies might be the final action scene which provides two laugh-out- loud scenes.",
