This movie is everything, funny, serious, edgy, philosophical, realistic! Great camera work and lighting capture the edgy moments, and the soundtrack totally kicks. Wow, I can't rave about this movie enough! If you thought Blair Witch was unrealistic and are looking for something thought provoking and different, check this one out. You won't be disappointed.",
