Jullia Roberts a real beauty i might Say, but At the end i understood why they do not kiss, coz they do not have the talent for a romantic kiss haha. But the Story was cute, she was ok, the transition to Being educated was too quick though, i Felt that her change was too abrupt, maybe should have been more Smooth. I Also think it would have been nice to have a bit of back Story on Both of them. It was a bit too focus on their interaction as a couple not on individual as well. As a total I give it a 7, as it was cute, and it is such an emblematic movie!",
