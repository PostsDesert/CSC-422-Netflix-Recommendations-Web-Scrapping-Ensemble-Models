Born romantic falls into the second category.\n\nThe plot is Three Male losers go to a Salsa club in different circumstances. One has the appearance of a rich Latin lover. In truth he is broke and living with his ex wife. The thief is a bad thief, only lucky enough not to get caught. He meets up with an extrentric woman who tends graves. Finally Frankie A musician who is desperate to meet up with his ex fianc√©e Mo played by the magnificent Jane Horrocks, who he dumped eight years ago.\n\nNearly all use a mini cab driver, who gives help for all those in the back of his car, as the film progresses it becomes apparent, he is in as much need of help as all the other characters.\n\nIf you like the rhythm of the salsa, which becomes infectious, and want something to watch that is not to strenuous on the mind and can stand the occasional cringing moments, then I can recommend this film."
