Also Erin Chandler (Miss Make Do) is impressive...she is excellent as Leslie's muse! Michelle Phillips is wonderful and there are several other surprise cameos such as John Ritter as the impassioned preacher! It captures the dilemma of being gay not only in the world but in the very judgmental south! Mark Pellegrino plays a gorgeous Tripper! Some feel the piece is dark but it is a very realistic look at homosexuality in the 70's! No wonder this film won several independent film festivals!",
