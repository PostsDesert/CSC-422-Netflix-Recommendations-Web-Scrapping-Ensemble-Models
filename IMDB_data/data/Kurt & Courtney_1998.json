There were a number of different characters in the story who all added great variety and elements of emotion. I never get tired of films like this one. It amazes me how rich history is with stories like these of people who lived thru the horrors of war and tyranny. Stories of their struggles, victories and how they just survived it all. So much detail went into the story that helped you really see each character and their lives. I wasn't disappointed with any part of the series and watched every part of it to the end. Sorry to actually get to the end. Could have gone on...where is Season 2?",
