        "reviewBody": "As a straight-to-DVD sequel made some 13 years after everyone had long forgotten about the original movie, SINGLE WHITE FEMALE 2: THE PSYCHO (what a useless sub-title!) doesn't disappoint. By that, I mean it's as defunct as you imagine it's going to be, a slightly cheesy follow-up to the first film featuring none of the same actors and an all-too-familiar script.\n\nAs DVD bargain bin fodder goes, SINGLE WHITE FEMALE 2 is far from the worst I've seen. The most interesting thing about it is the story, which avoids clich√© for the first half and sets up an interesting situation in a love triangle that centres around a PR agency in New York. You're left guessing as to who the titular psycho is. Things gradually become more predictable towards the ending, and the climax is just as you'd expect, but for the most part it's not too bad and it held my interest.\n\nOne interesting thing about the production is TV director Keith Samples, who directs this film like it's a softcore erotic thriller, such as the ones Shannon Tweed starred in (endlessly) during the 1990s. Every actress is required to do at least one underwear or semi-nude scene, all the women wear low-cut, loose fitting clothing, and Samples spends an inordinate amount of time ogling female flesh.\n\nWhile the cast is nothing to write home about, I quite enjoyed the performance from the unfamiliar actors. Kristen Miller headlines and makes Holly a tough, sympathetic lead for the most part, while Allison Lange does well to play it understated for much of the running time. Todd Babcock and Brooke Burns are less effective, but certainly passable enough for this genre.\n\nSo, in summation, SINGLE WHITE FEMALE 2 is just about par for the course for this sort of film. It's certainly fast-paced and held my attention for the running time. Given that I didn't like the original movie at all, I found this a step up despite the obvious flaws.",
