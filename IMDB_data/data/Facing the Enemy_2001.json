Linden Ashby,(Griff McCleary),\"Whacked\",'02, is a detective who is having problems with his marriage and has drifted away from his wife(Olivia) and their romantic activities in the bedroom. Alexandra Paul,(Olivia McCleary),\"A Woman Hunted\",'03, is suffering from a loss in her family and meets up with Maxwell Caulfield,(Horlan Moss),\"Submerged\",2000 who fixes her car and seeks a romantic relationship. The plot twists and turns and you wonder just how the film will finally END! Good entertainment for a TV film! \n\n.",
