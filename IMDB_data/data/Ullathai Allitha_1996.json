        "reviewBody": "Karthik is the son of a tyrant rich father who is very strict . He wants Karthik to marry his friend's daughter Ramba. Some misunderstanding leads Karthik to believe that the bride is fat and ugly . He runs away to Ooty to escape that life . He starts working in Rambha's house with Goundarmani as a driver. Our movies are filled with meaningless coincidences .Who looks for logic in movies anyway . Rambha's father Manivannan is a coffee estate owner . Slowly Karthik and Rambha fall in love .Karthik's cousin who is happy that he was missing now tries to get him killed . A few fights ,duets , mis understandings later all becomes well. The movie has many plots ,subplots , twists , coincidences to keep us engaged. Songs are catchy. Rambha has a great figure and wears nice, shorts and mini skirts to show it off . Karthik is the back bone of this movie though he looks old for Rambha .Its a treat watching him in any role . One never gets tired of misty dewy Ooty and its locales . I always found Goundarmani and Senthil comedy a bit loud .",
