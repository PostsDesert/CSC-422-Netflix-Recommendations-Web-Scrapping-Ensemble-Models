Not to date myself, but I remember the very first time it aired on\n\nCBS at the ripe old age of 7! I've never missed it since! Nothing encapsulates childhood, camaraderie and the spirit of\n\nHalloween more than this Charles M. Schultz classic. Charlie\n\nBrown and his bag of rocks, Snoopy and the Red Baron, Linus'\n\ningenious use of his security blanket for a ghost costume, Vince\n\nGuaraldi's great score, and of course, bossy Lucy and her\n\nsarcastic voice of reason - I think we all know a 'Lucy' growing up! All the feelings of anticipation, excitement and fear so commonly\n\nassociated with this spooky holiday is captured here - even the \n\nfeeling of great disappointment when awakening the day after and\n\nknowing one must wait another FULL year for this greatest of\n\nholidays to come again - another year to plan and live out your\n\nfantasy. Well, at least there's Charlie Brown Xmas to get us over\n\nthe hump! Good Grief!!"
