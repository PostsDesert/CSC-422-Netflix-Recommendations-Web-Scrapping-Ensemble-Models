If you keep watching and read the credits at the end of this DVD, you will see that the clip with Viggo in it is from the movie The Indian Runner (1991), also starring David Morse (The Green Mile - 1999, Hack - TV - 2002). That's really all I wanted to say, but seeing I am here... Never really a huge fan of Bruce Springsteen, watched this because I run a karaoke business, and a mate was pestering me to sing some Bruce, so he loaned me this DVD so I could learn some. Gradually becoming more of a fan. If you ARE a big fan, then you need this DVD.",
