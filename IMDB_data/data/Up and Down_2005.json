The movie is unusual when compared to what an American would consider the \"norm\". It does not have a main story line, a hero or a heroine, but still manages a rather heroic act to address sensitive and uncomfortable issues of contemporary Czech society without apologies and in a very realistic way. It does this by presenting several unrelated stories that are nevertheless intervowen, a technique that was reminiscent of an earlier Czech movie called \"Buttoners\" (knoflikari). The movie is strangely touching, but I found it also pretty depressing, forcing the viewer to contemplate the tremendous changes due to changing demographics that Europe in general, and Czech Republic in particular, are experiencing.",
