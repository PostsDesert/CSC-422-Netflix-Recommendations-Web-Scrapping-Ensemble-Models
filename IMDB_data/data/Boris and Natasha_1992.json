Had to give it a look, and it's got its moments, but is vastly outclassed by 2000's \"Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle\" with Jason Alexander and Renee Russo. At the very least, more effort could have been put into making the principals resemble the cartoon originals with makeup and hairstyling. Note Sally Kellerman as executive producer-- she bankrolled this production. Corey Burton's Narrator doesn't sound as much like the original Narrator, William Conrad, as the 2000 film's Narrator, Keith Scott, who also voiced Bullwinkle and other characters in that production. But what the heck, enjoy what works and ignore the rest.",
