        "reviewBody": "It starts out bumpy, and the low-budget feeling doesn't help, but stay with this ultimately charming film. Anthony Rapp, who we've watch growing up since he worked for Disney in \"Adventures in Babysitting\" to become a Broadway star in \"Rent\", plays the brooding, still-needs-to-grow-up, David - searching for a deeper meaning in life.\n\nIf David were only to get off his high horse at the end of the day, he'd realize that he's searching for the very things that we are all searching for: love, sex and a feeling of satisfaction in the broader scheme of things.\n\nHis constant brooding over deeper meanings is made trivial by his constant blunders with the simplest things in life: like listening to other people, observing and understanding. His self-absorbedness gets him in one sticky situation after the next, deriving in the end, what the absolute truths of life are: you are born, you somehow have to get by and then you die. Everything else is what you make out of it."
