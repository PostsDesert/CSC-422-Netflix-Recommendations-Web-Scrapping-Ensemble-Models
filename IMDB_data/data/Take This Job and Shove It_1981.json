        "reviewBody": "Don't anybody get me wrong! This movie is one of the funniest, wildest movies I've seen in my life. And it is a classic with a capital C! Robert Hays of \"Airplane\" (1980) goes from an idiot who can't fly a plane to a tough but reasonable head brewery chief in \"Take This Job And Shove It\". And can he get the women here in this movie. Whoo! Barbara Hershey is the hottie to watch for. Lord, if I was Robert Hays' character, I'd be drooling like a hungry wolf over her. She was hot! Of course, the highlights of this movie are the music, the barroom scene where all the gang is playing football with a roll of toilet paper, and a couple of \"giving the finger\" scenes that when aired for network TV, are cruelly chopped out, yet I thought were quite funny at best.\n\nDavid Keith plays the arrogant Harry, who really turns out to be a decent guy toward the film's end.\n\nTim Thomerson is the wild and smart-aleck country boy from hell Ray. The man drinks more beer and has a mean streak in him that sure can't be dealt with.\n\nArt Carney does a fine job as Mr. Pickett, head of the beer company that Robert Hays is owner of the brewery. He's packed on a few pounds since his \"Honeymooners\" days, but you need not bother! Eddie Albert rounds out the cast in my opinion as the overbearing egotistical Mr. Ellison, who always wants something, including coffee. He is a big contrast from his days on \"Green Acres\" here. It makes one think if Arnold The Pig could handle such a domineering old fart like Ellison here.\n\nAltogether, this is a great movie. Despite what anyone else would say, you can't turn down an offer to watch this movie, or would you just say \"Take This Movie And Shove It\"? I would say \"Take This Movie And Watch It\" and hopefully, you'll love it!\n\nI sure watched it! And I loved it! (I still love it!)",
