        "reviewBody": "Received the DVD as a Christmas present, and only have one complaint (and it's not even the movie's fault) -- I wish the aspect ratio were widescreen. A movie as inspirational as this deserves that \"big screen\" look, especially for the numerous (and well shot) football sequences. Funny that the trailer appears to be widescreen. Hmmm.\n\nWell acted, and believable, there were several touching moments in the various character's journeys. Lacey Chabert and Nick Cornish have a good on screen chemistry, while Terry O'Quinn is perfect as the perfectionist coach. I thought I could predict how everything would turn out. I was wrong -- and I love that in a movie!\n\nAlso nicely done: the background score. (Wish the audio was 5.1, but the Dolby Pro Logic was quite adequate). Dan Haseltine and Joe Hogue are to be congratulated on creating a nice \"high school\" feel during the many action sequences. The quiet scenes are are rendered nicely, reminding me of the excellent score from \"Remember the Titans\".\n\nFor it's sound focus on quality drama, moving moments, great sport shots and without trashy language, I highly recommend this film.",
