        "reviewBody": "Nice historical glimpses into Jerry bluegrass side, wonderfully captures the creative process of Garcia/Grisman, especially the making/performance of \"Arabia\". This part of the movie interweaves the performance of the 12 + minute opus with the creation and recording of it. \n\nIt's really nice to see Jerry in a relaxed setting with Grisman's family, especially during this time that he was under tremendous pressure from his commitments to the Dead. It is well documented that Jerry wanted to take a break from touring with Dead and you can see the stress creep in when he speaks of the grueling touring schedule the Dead was requiring of him.\n\nYou really get the feeling of the friendship and joy Garcia and Grisman shared. Most of all, the music is warm and uplifting... Love this movie.",
