Wealthy woman invites some friends over to her place to play a pratical joke, which invloves faking the deaths of everybody, on an enemy of hers. However, someone shows up and actually starts killing everybody.\n\nNot nowhere near as explotive as DeCoteau's previous efforts, and mildly entertaining, but awfully mechincal and by the numbers. The references to Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer throughout the whole film feel really out of place here.\n\nRated R; Graphic Violence and Sexual Situations."
