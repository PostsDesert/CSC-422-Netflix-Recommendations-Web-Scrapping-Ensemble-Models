I picked it up because I recently stumbled across Norman Reedus and am trying to find more of the films that he's been in.\n\nI'm not big into hustler movies or con movies, but I have to say, this one roped me in within minutes. Probably because I couldn't quit figure out exactly who was hustling who. This movie is stylish and fast-paced, with a story that is believable thanks to location and fantastic performances.\n\nWhile I was impressed with most in the film, I must say Dagmara Dominczyk was simply excellent.\n\nGive it a chance-it's a really fun film.",
