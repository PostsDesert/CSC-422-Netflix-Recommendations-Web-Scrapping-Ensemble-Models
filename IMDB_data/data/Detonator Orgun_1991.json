        "reviewBody": "I've seen a ton of anime over the last 40 years and this is one of the best.\n\nWhat really surprises me is that I didn't see this before now.\n\nThe art direction is great (borrowing from Blade Runner, Aliens, and Return of the Jedi). Mech designs are excellent. I suspect that the designer of these is likely the same person who later designed the mechs for Evangelion. Of course, this pre-dates Neon Genesis by many years.\n\nThe story is a simple one with an important message. It's a theme that appears in a lot of anime. Today's viewers should put this into context and realize that many famous anime have borrowed from this series. And for the message that it conveys, Detonator Orgun succeeds where Harmageddon failed.\n\nTop all of this cool presentation off with a soundtrack that features a vocalist that sounds like a Japanese version of Ultravox. Awesomeness abounds.",
