How much of Woody Allen is Sandy Bates? Some, I'm sure, but I think it's more interesting to compare Sandy to Woody Allen's \"persona\"--that is, who the public thinks he is.\n\nThe structure of the film is also quite interesting to me. Allen had done a very non-linear story structure, mixed with occasional flights of fantasy, in \"Annie Hall,\" but \"Stardust Memories\" does that and piles on a movie within a movie within a movie, and manages to both comment on all that, at the same time as he's telling the story of the brilliant, but self-absorbed Sandy Bates.\n\nA great movie, that you probably should see more than once to appreciate.",
