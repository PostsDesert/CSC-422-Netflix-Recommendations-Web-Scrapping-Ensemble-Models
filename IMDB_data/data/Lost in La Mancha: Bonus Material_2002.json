        "reviewBody": "\"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\" has the makings of a brilliant film. It's a twisted take on Cervantes from the mind of director Terry Gilliam, starring Jean Rochefort, Johnny Depp, and Vanessa Paradis. The only problem is that the film has not been made. It REFUSES to be made.\n\nFilmmakers Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe initially set out to chronicle Gilliam as he made his quixotic dream come true. Instead they captured the floods, bombings, and various \"acts of God\" that shut the movie down. The result is \"Lost in La Mancha\", a documentary about a courageous but capsizing production. It works because by presenting Gilliam's story, Fulton and Pepe also illustrate the joy and pain that all filmmakers experience to some degree. We often witness Gilliam's frustration, but we also see his delight when his vision briefly comes to life.\n\nOne is left with a new appreciation for the daring movies that do make it through production, as well as some hope for the completion of \"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\". Gilliam is depicted as a dreamer, not a failure. \"Lost in La Mancha\" is an enjoyable celebration of those who tilt at windmills."
