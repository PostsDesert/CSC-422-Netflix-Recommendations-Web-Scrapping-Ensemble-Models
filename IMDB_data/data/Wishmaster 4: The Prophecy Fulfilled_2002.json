        "reviewBody": "This film is a far better example of a sequel than a lot of other straight to video sequels. Although this is not \"Citizen Kane\" by any means it is an entertaining and well acted movie, in most respects. Personally, i was impressed by the performance of Michael Trucco playing the human face of the Djinn. His voice in several scenes was an interesting tribute to Andrew Divoff. His performance far surpasses Chris Connery from the third installment. The female lead is sexy, and not untalented. And for the first time since the original, the story is different. What people fail to realize is this is an anthology film series, the others who reviewed this flick keep comparing John Novak's Djinn to Andrew Divoff's original performance. He is not the same Djinn, he is not meant to be the same Djinn. The Djinn both singular and plural are a race of beings created after the angels but before man. There are more than one of them out there. Another factor to consider is that this is the fourth installment of the series, as a writer, director and actor in this film, you inherit three films worth of storyline and baggage, and with the shrunken budget, you have very little to work with. The story has originality, the film is fast paced, it contains some humor and interesting wish fullfillment, and it has new characters and a new dimension to the Djinn mystique. It's a good flick, and i suggest it to all Wishmaster fans. Just keep an open mind.",
