        "reviewBody": "Diane Ladd's fun, nutty performance alone makes this film worth the price of admission. She stars as a scientist who has token chicken eggs and mixed them with dinosaur DNA. She is intent on creating a breed of carnovourous dinosaur that would wipe out the human race. The special effects are plain out awful, however the film is entertaining, fast paced, and has its share of humor and scares. Good paranoid finale too."
