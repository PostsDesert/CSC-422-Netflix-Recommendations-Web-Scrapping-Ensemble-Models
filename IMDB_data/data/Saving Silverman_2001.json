I happened to find it again on Netflix, so I decided to sit down and watch it again.\n\nIt turned out that the movie was actually funny, and I did recall the basics of the storyline. Darren (played by Jason Biggs) is about to marry Judith (played by Amanda Peet), a thing that Darren's two best friends, Wayne (played by Steve Zahn) and J.D. (played by Jack Black) does not want to see happen.\n\nThe cast in the movie was good, and I especially enjoyed the roles played by Jack Black, Steve Zahn and Amanda Peet, because they really carried the movie so well.\n\nThere are some good laughs here and there throughout the course of the movie.\n\n\"Saving Silverman\" can be watched more than once; you just have to wait a significant amount of years before doing so.",
