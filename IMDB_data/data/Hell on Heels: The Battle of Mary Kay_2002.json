        "reviewBody": "I decided to tape this movie on a lark. At first, I thought they were going for maximum silliness, but the story sucked me in anyway, and I enjoyed it all the way to the end.\n\nMary Kay's women are passionate about their product. For a lot a good reasons, too -- The lady herself was extremely inspirational. The rival company behaved more like modern entities: its executives rode their stock up, and then the employees hurt the most when the company crashed. Meanwhile, Mary Kay took her company private, kept treating her employees like human beings, and grew ever larger.\n\nThe movie's best line (from Mary Kay): \"Son, you do know it was never about the makeup.\"\n\nShirley MacLaine outdid herself playing Mary Kay. Overall, the film was funny and serious at the same time, and a total treat. It's worth 8 out of 10 stars.",
