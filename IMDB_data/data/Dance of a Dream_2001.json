        "reviewBody": "I have watched most of Andy Lau's movies and must say, this is a break from gang triad movies and sad love stories and such. A breath of fresh air with a dash of tango! Can Andy dance or what! Okay, so he can act and sing, hey but dance... Give him the all around award for doing it all. Anita mui and sandra Ng are not to be overlooked either. Anita can play the cold ice queen or loving partner whatever the script calls for, and she delivers. As for Sandra Ng, what else can one say but superb. You love sandra from the moment you see her longingly staring at andy with moon eyes till the last joyful smile in the final scene! Note: Anita and Sandra are a hoot in the cha cha dance skit scene. They can play comical men as good as any man could with great voices to boot.Not to leave out that Andy has a great pair of legs in the drag number he does. Personally I watched this movie right away after viewing it just to watch the cha cha scenes and tango scene with Andy and Sandra once more! Put this on your must see list and buy the sound track ,you won't regret it. Now go tango!",
