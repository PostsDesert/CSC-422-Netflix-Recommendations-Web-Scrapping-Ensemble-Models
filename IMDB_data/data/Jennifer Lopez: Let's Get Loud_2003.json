She put on a really fine show and what I like best about her is that she started without show biz parents or family. She did it on her own. I don't know why so many people, especially critics (who are completely talentless) go out of their way to be critical of her. I believe she is as good an actress as any other. What makes some actors great, are the scripts they select. While it's true that some actors can play a part better than another, it not because of their acting ability only. Other things enter into the mix and the most important is the script. In every role I have seen Jennifer Lopez play, she is very believable. Even the movie Gigli which was so badly panned. It wasn't a great script, but both Ben Afleck and Jennifer Lopez did their parts well. I agree that the movie wasn't good, but it wasn't the fault of Ben or Jen. Unless you blame them for doing it in the first place. Anthony J. Mujica",
