It was a competent film, and I can even admit that I laughed on occasion, but the negatives far outweigh the positives. Martin Short was staggeringly hateful in this movie, and even though I suppose that was the whole point, it really is hard to be entertained when the main character is SO irritating. Personally, I would have loved to see his character get decapitated at the end, for it would have turned the film into a feel-good movie. Or better yet, he could have been killed off in the beginning.",
