        "reviewBody": "The last good film Stuart Gordon made was 1985's \"Re- Animator,\" which I also give a 7 of 10.\n\nI mention the former mainly because this film is just as gripping and disturbing. This is not a horror-movie like the former, but it is \"horrific\" with its peculiar violent realism.\n\nNot much by way of character-development for the protagonist, but in this case, the less said about him the better, or we may not come around to be sympathetic with him when it counts. What we do know of the character Sean Crawley is pretty damn ugly, but unknown actor Chris McKenna has a screen presence that makes him somewhat likable, or at least puts us in his corner in the end.\n\nThis film is not a good choice for mixed company, much less a date, but worth watching when home alone and prepared to be wonderfully disturbed.",
