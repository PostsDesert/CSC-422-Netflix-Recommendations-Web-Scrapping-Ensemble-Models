        "reviewBody": "\"Sanford and Rising Son\" was the first of four episodes scripted by Garry Shandling, then just beginning his career as writer/performer, followed by \"The Director,\" \"The Camping Trip,\" and \"Committee Man.\" Lamont surprises his father with a surprise dinner produced by neighbor Ah Chew (Pat Morita, sixth of seven), whose family considered cooking to be an art form. After learning that Ah Chew could spend half as much as any Japanese restaurant whipping up the same gourmet meals, Fred sees dollar signs by allowing his own kitchen to be used in a take out business: \"don't cook tonight, call Sanford Delight!\" Bubba asks about the Oriental Express: \"made you feel loose in the caboose!\" Hutch (Arnold Johnson, third of five) becomes the well dressed Maitre D' and Bubba serves as the waiter for Fred's newly opened Japanese restaurant, which plays havoc with the junk business. Easily Pat Morita's finest showcase, with one further appearance as a hilarious Japanese colonel in \"Sergeant Gork.\"",
