It was extremely well done...well-written, lovingingly directed, beautifully acted...just a joy to watch. Megan Edwards was amazing as the lead, Sara - comepletely believable throughout her character's journey, which could've been tricky in the hands of a less talented actress. I was captivated by this film from start to finish. I'm glad I was lucky enough to stumble upon a screening. As of this writing I don't think it has a distributor...it would be a shame if this film didn't get seen by a wider audience. See it if you can.",
