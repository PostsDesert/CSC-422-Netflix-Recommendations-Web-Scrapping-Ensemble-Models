        "reviewBody": "The House On Sorority Row is one of my favorite slasher films of the 80's and i beleive that I Know What You Did Last Summer ripped this film off big time. Its about a group of sorority girls that accidently murder their house mother. After disposing her body they are stalked by someone who witnessed their crime. its not overtly gory but the death scenes are great and convincing, there is plenty of suspense and you are always kept hooked. It is well worth seeing for all slasher movie fans. Its also intersting to see future actors in their first roles like Harley Jane Kozak (Aracnaphobia) and especially Eileen Davidson who plays Kristen Blake Black on Days of Our Lives. See it!"
