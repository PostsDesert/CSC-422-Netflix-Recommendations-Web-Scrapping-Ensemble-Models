Bruce Brown takes us to various surfing locales with his customary great photography, wry comments and solid musical score. The big waves of the North Shore of Oahu are among the many featured locations. Interesting twist to this one is his old narration was lost, so he redid it and we get commentary 30 years or so after the fact, which only adds to the fun. Doubt if it's ever shown on TV so rent or buy the video, good for many repeat viewings.",
