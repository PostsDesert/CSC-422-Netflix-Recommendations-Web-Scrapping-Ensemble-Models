        "reviewBody": "I WILL SURVIVE is, in short, the best possible result of what a recent American movie with Madonna and Ruppert Everett could have been. This European version with less famous (worldwide) stars, though very well-known on their local turf, is the classic example of ground which continues to be solidly on the other side of the Atlantic. The Europeans consistently put out intelligent sex/love-themed comedies while North Americans continue to fall short of the mark in this genre. If you don't understand this, check out I WILL SURVIVE, currently making the \"Festival\" Circuit in North America. The natural approach taken to nudity, sexual orientation, frank discussions of love and sexual dilemmas, and unsanitized situations (while still taking place in the upper classes of society) contrasts stridently with Hollywood fare. Ultimately, the contrast might be explained by the Puritanism which still permeates North American morals. However, the fact still remains that smarter, better, and just as glossy (if not glossier) comedies continue to come from Spain and France, in particular. If you need proof, don't miss I WILL SURVIVE.",
