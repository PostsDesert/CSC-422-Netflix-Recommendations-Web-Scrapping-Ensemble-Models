        "reviewBody": "One more Masala movie from Bollywood which has all the elements to woo the audience. Such movies dominated the film Industry in 70 and still now it is in the making. It is a remake of Krishna Vamsi's (of Shakti: The Power fame) Telugu film KHADGAM released in 2002.\n\nAjay Devgan and Akshay Kumar enacted the roles which Srikanth and Prakash Raj has done in the original. The positive side of the film is that it has numerous mass attractive moments and hogwash situations that would be liked by the common man i.e. the conflict scene between Ajay and Masood, Akshay Kumar introductory scene and also the sequences between Akshay Kumar, Esha Deol, and Archana Puran Singh are well carried through.\n\nThe climax of the film is a hostage drama with the lofty actions and the awesome acting. As far as acting goes, Devgan does convincingly well as the hard cop, and Akshay gives his fans what they want (he has proved once again that he is a good performer as I predicted about him when I saw him in Khiladi but the Critics and majority of audiences accepted him after Hera Pheri and Dhadkan).\n\nTusshar has done a fine job and he proved that he is a directors actor. Ask him for the best and he will deliver the paramount. After Mujhe Kuch Kehna Hain Khakee and Gayab this is his best performance. Esha Deol is likable. Koena Mitra has except one song and two scenes. Lara Dutta and Laila were just about okay. Laila doesn't have the sexy looks. She can do the gaon ki gori kind of characters. Amongst character actors, Rahul Dev and Archana Puransingh register an impact. 2 1/2 Out of 5."
