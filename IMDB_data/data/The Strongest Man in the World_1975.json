        "reviewBody": "Enjoyed viewing this very comical film dealing with a group of college students performing various tests in their school laboratory classes. Kurt Russell, (Dexter Riley) tries out a chemical he discovered by mistake and pours it on his cereal which he gives to a cow and eats some of it himself. The dean of the college is Higgins, (Joe Flynn) who is not very happy with this class spending all kinds of money on these experiments, but when he finds out it gives off a very special power of superhuman strength, Higgins decides to sell this formula to a cereal company. There are great veteran stars, Cesar Romero, (A J Arno), Phil Silvers, (Kringle) who gave great supporting roles along with Joe Flynn who had a short career dying at the age of 50 years of age. Great entertainment.",
