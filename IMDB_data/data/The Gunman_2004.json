        "reviewBody": "I generally like to watch independent films as opposed to the big Hollywood productions especially when a subject tends to be controversial. I was generally dissatisfied with this movie and it isn't to do with just one thing but several things which niggle at the back of my mind. The plot could have been the basis of a really good story, working policeman investigating missing children finds himself emotionally involved when his wife is shot to prevent his daughter being snatched, but the story rapidly settles into a tried and tested formula and inconsistencies creep in such as if you are going to shoot a woman you aren't going to leave the daughter behind if she was your goal. I'm not sure if it was the way the film was edited but there were continuity problems, perhaps it was felt that the film had to be shorter but sometimes I felt that I had missed something somewhere like missing a page of a book. I guessed who the assassin was but there was no reason why the child snatcher became what he was. Perhaps I demand too much it was a good effort on a difficult subject but better direction and editing would have made a the storyline better"
