So maybe the order you see them influences your opinion cause I am (now) a die-hard fan of Eddie's stand-up but I seem to disagree with most other fan's that this is actually almost his best piece. My order would be: 1) Definite article 2) Circle 3) Glorious 4) Dress to kill 5) Unrepeatable 6) Sexie (which was not great actually, to say the least). Haven't seen live at the ambassadeur yet though but I suspect it will knock Sexie of that list. One other thing of course might be that this was actually recorded in the US as opposed to most of the others.",
