        "reviewBody": "The director is credited with the song \"Maria's Eyes\", but having just seen a theater version of Dr. Dolittle, I heard a song that sounded too similar for coincidence: \"When I Look in Your Eyes\", written by Leslie Bricusse. However, I'll grant that the original lacks something by being sung to a seal instead of Natassja Kinksi.\n\nAside from the musical borrowing, you have to admire Konchalovsky for wanting to tackle the material, revolving around small-town characters and impotence; he really brings out the dignified melancholy of a rust-belt town with steep streets, passing freight trains, weak sunlight and beautiful countryside. The movie is uneven in places, mostly from the performances: Kinski seems unsure whether to play her character modestly or with sashaying allure; Savage has a tough job playing an unsympathetic character, but sometimes makes it worse with explosive histrionics; Mitchum is stuck with bad dialog (\"those eyes\"). Raising the movie above these problems is a good basic story, affecting shots and images, and the majority of Kinski and Savage's scenes together.",
