        "reviewBody": "For All Mankind: Season One is an AppleTV+ series and a Sony Television production set during 1969 and 1974 in an alternate universe where US astronauts are not the first humans to land on the moon. With the Soviets gaining hand in the space race, Americans rush to establish a base on the moon and hopefully reach Mars one day. Buzz Aldrin does set foot but his famous words do not make headlines. Joel Kinnaman and Michael Dorman set up the first station called Jamestown but before they do so they must make sure there is water minerals for long term survival. Nixon made it his mission to include women in space but not till the Russians got there first. Sonya Walger acts as the first American female astronaut in space and on the moon. Most of the history and people stayed the same but Carter never became President but rather Ted Kennedy replaced Gerald Ford and Reagan gets into office four years earlier than anticipated. Although the storyline started out slow, the visuals, actors, and the space theme was very captivating. Second and third seasons have already aired with the fourth season in the process. Definitely add this series to your list.",
