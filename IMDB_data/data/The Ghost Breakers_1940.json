Bob Hope's humour as \"Larry Lawrence\" is at its best. The leading lady and sidekick-man servant support characters really compliment the lead actor. The story line is funny and scary at the same time. I feel the special effects of the \"ghost\" were superb for the time it was filmed. It still sends chills down my spine & roll with laughter. You should note a young Anthony Quinn plays two characters."
