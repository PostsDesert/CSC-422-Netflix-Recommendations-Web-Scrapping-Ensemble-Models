        "reviewBody": "It looks like Velocity Home Entertainment does some of the editing of the movies they release on home video because they all look the same. In \"Mafioso: The Father, The Son\" the editing of the violence or any sort of action is sped up to make it look \"cool\". The same goes with \"Endangered Species\". The DVD box art is not only horrible but misleading. There's a monster on the cover, even though it's about aliens. Direct To Video legend Eric Roberts is a detective figuring out who is killing people in spas and gyms. The plot is ridiculous, the special effects are laughable. The chase scene in this movie is so inept and badly edited that all you can do is stare at the screen in disbelief. The saving graces are: The good performance by Eric Roberts, the gratuitous nudity, and the gunfight at the police station (which does contain some unexpected surprises) If you want to laugh, rent it now!\n\nFor more insanity, please visit: comeuppancereviews.com",
