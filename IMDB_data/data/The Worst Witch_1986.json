        "reviewBody": "This adaptation of the much-loved book, is surprisingly good entertainment, that is a little short. The book was one of my favourites when I was little, and I loved the fact they added a couple of touches.\n\nThe only other criticism I have is the rather annoying title song. It was beautifully sung by a young Bonnie Langford but the tune got on my sister's nerves, when she herself watched it.\n\nThe acting is very good, if a little pantomime. Likewise with the songs, written by the acclaimed Don Black. Fairuza Balk is really cute as Mildred, bringing back memories from return to Oz. Diana Rigg is a suitably frosty Miss Hardbroom, and she is what I would imagine the character. Charlotte Rae and Anna Kipling are also amusing in their turns as Miss Cackle/Agatha and Ethel Hallow. My favourite was Tim Curry as the Grand wizard, he was just amazing, and the Halloween song was actually the main reason why this movie should be watched, because they matched the lyrics exactly.\n\nI have it on VHS. It is a little grainy, but it's because it's second hand. Watch it, and let your children watch it! They'll thank you! 8/10 Bethany Cox",
