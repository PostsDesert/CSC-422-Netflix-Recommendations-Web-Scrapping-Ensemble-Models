I was pleasantly surprised - it's great to see something so innocent and good hearted that isn't packed with the sort of mawkish sentimentality that often finds its way into kids' films. The bears are the stars of the show, with some excellent costume puppetry and some great characters (my favourite is Zeb, who plays a mean fiddle). The story is a simple one, and you know how it's going to end. And I usually hate country music, but enjoyed the rocky tunes that punctuate the movie. This is the sort of thing that will keep most kids amused for an hour and a half - and any adult who can let their inner child out for a bit will get a kick out of it too. I'd be happy to see more of the Country Bears...",
