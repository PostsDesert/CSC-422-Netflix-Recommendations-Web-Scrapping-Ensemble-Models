        "reviewBody": "I really like this movie because it has a feeling of being open and sincere. The first time I saw it I was shocked for two reasons: because it had been filmed in the city I was born in (and this was shown in the very opening scene which shows the Plaza de la Liberacion with its fountains and the famous cathedral of Guadalajara in the background) and because of the straightforward approach to such a \"delicate\" subject, such as the sincere love between two adult males, by the director Jaime Humberto Hermosillo. What I found most endearing in the whole movie is the fact that Doña Herlinda, the mother of one of the two men in love, knows about her son's sexual orientation but she's willing to accept it as long as she gets her only wish: a grandson. The acting is very good, the characters very much alive, and the many twists and turns on the story make this movie funny and poignant at the same time. I gave it only 9 stars because the choice of music used in the movie is old and outdated, even for the time the movie was originally filmed. This is a great love story for both gay and straight movie lovers.",
