Based upon the true story of Loretta Lynn, \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" profiles one of the greatest country singers of all time. \n\nMovies based on true stories are really hard to make since details must be mostly if not all accurate. \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" far succeeded this and what resulted was one of the best true stories ever brought to the big screen.\n\n\"Coal Miner's Daughter\" is a film that should be treasured and be considered as a classic because this is as close to greatness as you will get. Telling the story of how a coal miner's daughter went from rags to riches with the help of her husband Mooney. There is so much to learn from watching \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" that goes beyond what is shown on film.\n\nIf I take one thing away from this film it would be this: no matter what comes your way, always follow your heart and pursue your dreams because they will always come true. \n\nI was so proud to have seen this film because it was not only one of the best it was also an educational tool that I could implement in my life. I hope that everyone who reads this review will rent this film and get the same out of it as I did."
