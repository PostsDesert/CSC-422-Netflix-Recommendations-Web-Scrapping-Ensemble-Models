Also, there are other things that are good about this movie too probably.\n\nMatt Leblanc is in this movie. You probably remember him as one of the five funniest Friends on \"Friends.\" This is easily his best feature film outside of doing \"Friends,\" if for no other reason than this is the only movie I can think of that he was ever in.\n\nI don't want to spoil anything, and this is the type of movie that will really keep you guessing right up til the end, so I will end my review here. Let me just say that, if you only see one movie where Matt Leblanc plays baseball with a monkey, it should be \"Ed!\"",
