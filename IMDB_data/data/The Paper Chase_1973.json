I later found out about the Marine Reserves and avoided Vietnam, but I had always wondered if I had made a BIG mistake (I did have a successful career in data processing, however).\n\nWhen I saw this film, I immediately knew I had made the right choice. Most of my professors were just blustering blowhards who were trying as much to intimidate me as teach me (Kingsfield must have taken lessons from one professor of mine in particular, although Houseman was not half as intimidating as he was!).\n\nHart's realization that experience is almost as important as education( although sometimes not as lucrative) was a turning point in my life, and I have never looked back.\n\nNot enough credit is given to Lindsay Wagner in without a doubt what was her best performance--brava!",
