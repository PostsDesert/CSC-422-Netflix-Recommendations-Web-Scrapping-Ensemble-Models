The colors, the music, the pacing, the very gifted performers all add up to a breath taking event. My home was never so quiet, in awe, yet energized as we watched this spectacle. Comments such as \"Unbelievable\", \"Wow\", \"I can't believe this!\", \"No one can possibly do that\", and more, were repeatedly shouted out as we watched. This is much more than a film. It is alive with a spirit of it's own. You'll remember \"Cirque du Soleil: Quidam\" forever. This is a must see event. My family and I will travel far to catch this performance live....as will many others I'm sure.",
