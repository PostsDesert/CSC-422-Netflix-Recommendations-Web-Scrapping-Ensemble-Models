This was one of the most tasteful, restrained, talent-full displays of musical prowess and choreography I've seen in a long time, with show-stopping renditions by Michael Bell (Gethsemane) and by Elaine Paige of that assumed-to-be-trite Memory from the aforementioned Cats. Stunned I was by how she (Elaine) breathed pure life into this song. Just Wow. The Dolby Digital 5.1 surround acquits this production beautifully. 100% recommended.",
