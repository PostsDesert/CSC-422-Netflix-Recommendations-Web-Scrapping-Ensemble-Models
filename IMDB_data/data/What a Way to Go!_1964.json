Just go to the movies to see a flick done with all the nerve in the world and for what? \"To make a buck\" I have an idiot sitting next to me, he is the pseudo intellectual who killed movies like this. I envy my parent's generation, as far as movie going habits are concerned. Doris Day comedies and Belle de Jour. Tell me who could be so unself conscious today to make \"What a Way To Go\" for what it is. The world has changed so much, women, us, that it would be impossible not to make it feel satirical,\"Down with loveish\" \"What a Way to go\" maybe satirical in its own way but it's not self conscious. If we cold only disconnect the micro chip implanted in our brains during the 70's we could have a wider spectrum of our lives without passing judgment, learning or re learning to enjoy. Shirley Mac Laine is priceless. Adorable. Superb. Paul Newman, lovely and very funny. Robert Mitchum plays it hysterically straight. The Gene Kelly episode has a life all of its own. Robert Cummings plays Robert Cummings beautifully as usual. Dean Martin plays himself and a softer version of himself, Dick Van Dike plays a sort of Rob Petrie who wants to simplify. Directed by J Lee Thompson, a Brit, with \"Guns of Navarone\" to his credit. He had signed a few odd gems like \"Woman in a Dressing Gown\", \"Tiger Bay\" and \"Return from the Ashes\". I thought I mention that. Listen to me, disconnect the micro chip, lay back and enjoy!",
