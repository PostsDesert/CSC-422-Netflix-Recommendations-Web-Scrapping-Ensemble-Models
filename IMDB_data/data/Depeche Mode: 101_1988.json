I have been a fan since 1983 and as a person who was around in the 80-s I am floored by nostalgia!! We had zero fashion sense but it was a time of naive innocence , we did not take things that seriositet. And really good music. So nice to see Fletch also, Rest Easy!! Dave looks hot, Martin is happy and Alan plays so good.\n\nI just listened to Memento Mori and it has some great songs on there - whatever beef Martin and Dave had they seem to have resolved it now. I am sooo looking forward to see them!",
