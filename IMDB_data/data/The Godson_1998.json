        "reviewBody": "It's no wonder Rodney Dangerfield gets no respect. The Godson was a very bad opportunity for Dangerfield to show his comedic talents. And Dom DeLuise is essentially reprising his role from Robin Hood: Men in Tights, but with a different silly Godfather name. Unfortunately for DeLuise, what worked for a few minutes in one film doesn't work well for an entire movie. And Dangerfield and DeLuise don't even get much airtime behind the Kid in the Hall. The rest of the cast is virtually unknown, save an amusing cameo by Joey Buttafuoco. I love spoofs, but this one doesn't cut it."
