        "reviewBody": "Just suppose the film had been a reasonable success and maybe gained 10 million viewers in the United States, not that I agreed at all with a US co-production. Â£3.3 m is not a lot of money, even in 1996 for the BBC themselves to fork out.\n\nAccording to Bidding Adeau, there would have been at least 6 other films. Perhaps the next set in the future on a space station penned by Terry Nation? Maybe another with The Cybermen and one with the Daleks?\n\nI think if the TV series in 2005 works. There should be in parallel like DS9 ran along with Voyager, there should be an attempt to fill the gaps without running into Attack of the Cybermen syndrome. Maybe a few McGann films to see what happens between him and Christopher Eccleston's first appearance.\n\nThe half-human thing and kiss can be all but forgotten. A new TARDIS set.\n\nIf anything I would like to see more of McGann's Doctor. In that rape programme Lying he looked fantastic, still young enough."
