        "reviewBody": "The head of a white bigoted doctor (sadly Ray Milland) is attached to the body of a wrongly convicted black man (Rosey Grier) on Death Row. Unfortunately, Grier's head is still attached. It escapes from a hospital and tries to clear Grier's name while Milland's head tries to take control of the body.\n\nTotally ridiculous AIP movie which bears a more than passing resemblance to 1971's \"Incredible Two-Headed Transplant\". This movie doesn't take itself too seriously (how could it?) which helps--but only so much. \n\n With the exception of Milland the acting is lousy and the script has howlers that you just can't believe (ex: when Grier's girlfriend first sees him with Milland's head she says, \"Honey, I know you don't like answering questions, but HOW did this happen?\"). Basically this is a very bad movie but in a good way. The scenes of Milland and Grier arguing are truly funny and there's a very long (at least 20 minutes) but fun chase with tons of police cars chasing Grier/Milland on a motorcycle. Not even remotely good but fun.\n\nAnother great line from Grier's girlfriend: \"Do you have two of anything else?\"",
