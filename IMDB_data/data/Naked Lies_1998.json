Tweed proves once again that she is quite adept at handling martial arts scenes, and even if her face shows signs of aging, her body is still in great shape for a woman in her forties. The film is competently made (especially for a DTV project) and well-produced, shot on scenic Mexican locations. The main problems are the often slow pace, some gratuitous sex scenes (it's supposed to be an action thriller, not an erotic one....I think), and a disappointingly actionless climax. (**)",
