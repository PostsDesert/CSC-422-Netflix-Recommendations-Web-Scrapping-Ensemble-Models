The movie is intended as a family film, so its pretty mild, however if you've watched a lot of old horror films, especially low budget ones, you should love this. It is a good indication of at least some of the inspiration for newer movies such as the \"Scary Movie\" series. If you watch it, please keep in mind, it was made in 1981, even the movies that were well-funded and serious at that time appear campy to us now, so keep an open mind and a sense of humor and don't take the movie, or yourself, too seriously.",
