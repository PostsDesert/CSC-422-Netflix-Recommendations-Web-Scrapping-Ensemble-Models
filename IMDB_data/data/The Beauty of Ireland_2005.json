        "reviewBody": "While the family drama is plodding, the backdrop of Palestine during the years leading up to the birth of the state of Israel has a beautiful feel, and, from what I've studied, an authenticity to it. Not everyone understands the nuances -- the wealthy Armozas have quite possibly been in Jerusalem since their family was expelled from Spain in 1492, so they look down on the Ashkenazim, the recent arrivals from eastern Europe, with their payos, their Yiddish and their shtetl ways. These divisions persisted. Also, it's very true that the birth of the state was accompanied by two wars, not one. By the late 1920s Jews in Palestine were being attacked by their Arab neighbors as a response to increased Jewish immigration, and the attackers didn't always distinguish between recent arrivals and Jews who had lived there for centuries. This war is not as well known as the War of Independence of 1948, but in Israel they have not forgotten it and these incidents are dramatized.\n\nAdmittedly, several of the key characters are not all that likeable so it's harder to care about what happens to them. Still, if you enjoy a production with a real sense of time and place, give it a try.",
