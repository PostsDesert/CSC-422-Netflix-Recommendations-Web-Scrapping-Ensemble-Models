        "reviewBody": "With nothing to do this boring Friday, \"The Groomsmen\" were up on the television and I gave it a chance. I thought at first by reading the plot that it would be just another teen movie, like American Pie et cetera, but actually it was a little bit original at some points. It mixed up well between being a regular romantic comedy, with some more teen gent laughing. There's not much to demand from a piece like this, but this sure gives a surprise with the skill of those unknown actors and with the stunning laughs time from time. Just another Hollywood movie, but still it's better than the average romantic teen comedy. I'll give it a 6 out of 10, and I won't really recommend it unless you're bored and have nothing to do.",
