Here, he enlarged real grasshoppers for the special effects instead of models or stop-motion.\n\nAtomic testing on plants results in giant grasshoppers making for Chicago and the army trying to stop them. After going on the rampage in the country, killing several people in the process, they set their sites on the 'Windy City'. They climb buildings before drowning as a result of a high pitched sound which was invented to attract them.\n\nThis movie stars 50's sci-fi regulars Peter Graves (It Conquered the World) and Morris Ankrum (Earth vs. the Flying Saucers, Flight To Mars). Peggie Castle plays the main female lead and love interest. All play good parts and the score in this movie is quite good.\n\nI found this movie enjoyable despite the low budget. Watch it if you get the chance.\n\nRating: 4 stars out of 5."
