        "reviewBody": "For those unfamiliar this was Angelina Jolie's very first feature film, and one that she has said on numerous occasions she seriously regrets. In fact in one interview she said she was proud up until the moment she actually watched it, then she rushed hope to be literally sick. Hardly a ringing endorsement for a film that may well have been integral in the progression of her career!\n\nAt the tender age of just 18 she demonstrates why she became one of the most sought after actresses in Hollywood.\n\nAlso starring the legend that was Jack Palance, the excellent Billy Drago and handy character actor Elias Koteas the movie certainly has a competent cast if nothing else.\n\nGlass Shadow is the 4th movie in the Cyborg/Nemesis franchise. The whole series is deeply confusing and poorly put together, they really should have stuck numbers on the end of one title and left it be.\n\nIt tells the story of a cyborg who is meant to be used in a plot to force a hostile takeover on a rival company. This cyborg however is in love with her trainer and together they plan on fleeing with the help of a mysterious stranger.\n\nI can see why Jolie isn't proud of this but it certainly isn't THAT bad, it's just another Cyborg movie that fails to impress. Truth be told this is the best one yet (Mostly thanks to the cast).\n\nJust barely passable but incredibly dumb stuff.\n\nThe Good:\n\nOutstanding cast\n\nThe Bad:\n\nPlot was a tad wasted\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\n14yr age differences don't matter when one of you is a cyborg\n\nThe problem isn't cyborg or human envy, it's weiner envy!",
