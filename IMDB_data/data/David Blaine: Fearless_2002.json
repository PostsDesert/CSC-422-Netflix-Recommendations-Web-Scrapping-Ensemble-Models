And that is what gives so much interest and life to this collection of stunts and tricks we witness in this video.\n\nBlaine is quite compelling as a performer, stemming from his own enigmatic character. He looks and acts the part of a \"mind- altering\" powerful magician. \n\nThis is a good introduction to his work; it raised my curiosity to read his book and watch his other performances.",
