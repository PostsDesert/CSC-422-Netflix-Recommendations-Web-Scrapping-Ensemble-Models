Some special effects are a little cheesy. But they are used in such a way that you won't mind. The action scenes are fast paced and very energetic. There is not much of a story. The main part is about Ching's love for Yiu May-kwan (Anita Mui). There is lot of humor used in this movie. Sometimes it is a bit over the top but in combination with the serious love theme there is a fine balance which overall is very enjoyable. This movie is a showcase what the hong kong cinema is about. The lack of budget never is a problem for hong kong movie makers to be creative and come with a good product. When it comes to action Hong Kong cinema is the best. Saviour of the Soul is proof of that.",
