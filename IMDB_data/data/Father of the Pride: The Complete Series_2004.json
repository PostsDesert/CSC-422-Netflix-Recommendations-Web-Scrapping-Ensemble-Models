I love it that S & R are willing to allow the writers to poke a little fun at them and give them kudos for being good sports! Shrek had similar humor (doesn't anyone remember Donkey's dream?) and I'm sure the uptight right was offended by that too. Bottom line, don't like it, change the channel, but don't try to get it canceled and ruin it for those of us who do like it and can appreciate tongue-in-cheek humor and fantastic animation! Please keep making this series! I loved it! I can't wait to see what new characters are introduced next! By the way, there really is an elephant with a bird living in his enclosure in S & R's Secret Garden animal sanctuary!"
