        "reviewBody": "So we have 3 love stories throughout this movie - well, actually we have love for music as well, but traditional stories are three. One is very sexy, and once can justify that the gas masks the characters wear (there are attacks from Iraq at the time) and the need to be in the sealed room they share enhances the feelings. Eli is hardly a sentimental type, he asks Yana for a date as his lover yells for him from the bedroom ... yet he is very kind to Yana. He seems Mr. No Commitment, yet he is the one who asks \"what now\" after Yana's estranged husband is back to her life or at least back to the country. There is no real drama in this story. Prefering sexy and kind roommate to the husband who is ready to abandon Yana alone pregnant with a huge loan is a no brainer.\n\nThe second love story of Rosa who first appears very business like is sad and entertaining. It is more life story than love story and one that makes you sob.\n\nWhat truly amazes is the third couple. Alik is hardly anyone's type - yelling at his wife, squalid, dignity and morals long gone and you'd think his marriage experiences lack of contentment - yet it is Alik's wife who truly amazes with the way she looks at Alik, compliments him and her love is love that makes him a better man - at the end even Alik is quite a likable character!"
