Fast forwarding through some of the drek knocked another hour off.\n\nThe science was retarded. If their stupid little idea of nukes would have had half a chance of doing what they said it was doing, it would have required hundreds of them, not 6, and they would have had to been thousands of feet under ground, not hundreds. I don't know why I should be bothered about that as it makes as much sense as arguing the \"science\" in Star Trek.\n\nPhones that still worked when convenient to the \"plot\".\n\nIt had every cliche known to man and monkey. \"Marshal Law\" (Is that Jude Law's brother?)\n\nI gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because the little bit of footage they had of things falling down was done pretty well."
