        "reviewBody": "I saw Johnny Greyeyes today and was somewhat impressed. It is a very tough and depressing film. The plight of native people in this country is not a pretty one. It is basically a jail/family relationship centered plot. I believe the director was aiming for as realistic as possible a setting. I have heard that 90% of the female inmates in Canadian prisons are native.\n\nThe film is reasonably well shot and has passion in the acting. It is a credit that any film done about indiginous culture is being made. I do ,however, feel that one of the best films that touched on this is \"Heater\" with a fabulous performance by Gary Farmer.",
