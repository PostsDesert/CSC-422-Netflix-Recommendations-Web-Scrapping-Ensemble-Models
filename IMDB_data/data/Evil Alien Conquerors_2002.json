It doesn't really matter, as the thin plot is just a hanger for failed jokes, mediocre sight-gags, and the worst hairy feet make-up this side of \"Lord of the Rings.\" What might have been a decent five-minute \"Mad-TV\" skit is stretched into infinity in this enthusiastic time-waster. So bad, Tori Spelling refused to be listed in the credits!"
