They break out together and camp out in the ruins docks on the North River, and hang around Times Square, writing letters to radio personality Tim Curry and evading Miss Alvarado's father, Peter Coffield, who is in charge of the Times Square revival.\n\nIt's an erratic movie that doesn't seem to go anywhere, and the two women are an odd match, but the movie has a tremendous energy, powered by the on-site shooting and the quirky camerawork of James Contner. Director Allan Moyle would have a hit with many of the same themes with PUMP UP THE VOLUME.",
