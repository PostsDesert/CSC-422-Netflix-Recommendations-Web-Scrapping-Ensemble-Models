Cleve wants Dennis to write his life story, which he feels is most interesting, and as a way to get back at his former employer, a powerful corporation he helped build. Meechum is intrigued but also skeptical, so Cleve takes him on a tour of his past, both with his parents and also his \"assignments\". Dennis learns that Cleve has a deeper connection to him than he realizes, and that some powerful forces don't want this proposed book published...\n\nLittle-seen thriller is quite well done, with fine acting by the leads, and efficient direction and story. Almost goes wrong toward the end with the expected violent finale, but is still exciting enough to compensate, with the well-plotted story unfolding most effectively.\n\nWorth catching on DVD.",
