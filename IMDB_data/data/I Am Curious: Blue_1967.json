It's tour de force.\n\nWhen she's interviewing by-standers documentary style, she shines. When she's knee deep in anger and destroying sets, she's believable. When she's literally exposing all of herself for the sex scenes, she never holds back. In short, she's the ONLY reason I watched this film to its completion.\n\nI liked that this film is a film within a film. Otherwise, it serves no purpose. Sorry, folks; I calls 'em as I sees 'em.",
