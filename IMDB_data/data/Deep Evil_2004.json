Lorenzo Lamas is the sole bit of recognizable star power, but he's purely incidental to how enjoyable this flick turns out to be. Pour a drink, open a bag of chips and turn off your brain while you watch this one. If you take it too seriously you're going to end up bitter and twisted...just like many of the IMDb Users whose comments seem to be coming from either film-school dropouts or Hollywood wannabees. Or both. Remember - it's called the \"willing suspension of disbelief\" for a reason. Are we talking Academy awards here? Nope. Instead we have an hour and a half of cinematic popcorn - tasty enough to entertain but nothing that will stick with you for long. The folks at First Look Home Entertainment and DEJ Productions have given us another solid effort. Keep 'em coming, guys."
