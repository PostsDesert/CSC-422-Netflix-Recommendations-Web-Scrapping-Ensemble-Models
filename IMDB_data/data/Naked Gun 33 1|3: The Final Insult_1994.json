        "reviewBody": "Has its moments, but a bit flat after the first two movies.\n\nThe first Naked Gun was great: an hilarious slapstick-comedy. Clever, witty dialogue and brilliant sight-gags. So quotable. \n\nNaked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear was a decent sequel. This was especially as far as comedy movies go, as the drop-off in originality and quality is normally quite steep from the original to the first sequel.\n\nAdmittedly, it wasn't as good as the original, mainly because by now you know what to expect. Plus, it would have been difficult to match the originality and hilarity of the first.\n\nThis, the third in the series, still has some great moments, especially towards the end, but can't maintain throughout the same level of hilarity and originality as the first. For the first 75% or so of the movie it is so-so, with not too many great gags. It is only at the end - the Oscar ceremony - that it gets laugh-out-loud funny.\n\nOverall, entertaining and funny enough, but not as good as the first two movies, especially the first.",
