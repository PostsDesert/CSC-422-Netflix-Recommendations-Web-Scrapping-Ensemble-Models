She is simply spectacularly spot on with her characterization of the theme and culture that is her character here.\n\nThe story is a bit hard edged for some, but sadly, not entirely outside the realms of reality in the current world.\n\nDo characters like hers in this film really exist as portrayed? Absolutely yes. Do characters like that portrayed by Sutherland, the predatory pedophile sociopath who appears to be so acceptably \"normal\" to the outside world? Absolutely yes, as recent history has shown only too clearly.\n\nOn the surface this may have appeared to be a sort of whacky, creepy crime thriller, but actually, if one actually takes the time to watch this film, there is much more to this than the ad copy may have suggested at the time.\n\nIt is still currently viable, to this very day . . . has stood the test of time.\n\nAnd it is absolutely one of Reese's best ever performances.\n\nSadly, her more recent work has sort of flattened out into much less risky, complex roles, but hey, a great actress she is.",
