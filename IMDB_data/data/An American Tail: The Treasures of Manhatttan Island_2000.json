        "reviewBody": "For the record, I love \"An American Tail\". It's a pure classic for the young and young at heart. \"Fievel Goes West\" is alright, but it's humor kind of looses the magic and respects from the original movie, although Tanya is only character that appealed most audiences (disappointingly that Tony Toponi's role is reduced due to Pat Musick doing a lot of character voicings during that period). This movie, on the other, may have brought back the aspects of the original movie, but not even close. Unlike the original movie and the first sequel, this has more contents that are more aimed at older audiences rather than children, such as racism, police corruption, a big-busted stalker liking an European as a favor of a \"plaything\", subliminal messaging hanging on the Mousekewitz's wall, infidelity, and labor rights. The only good thing about this is the return of Tony Toponi, although his concept was derailed with such infidelity subplot (disappointing from the writers). Tanya's role is not at her best in this one, along with having the character being voiced by Lacey Chadbert, who is considered the worse choice as Cathy Cavadini is the winner for Tanya and a sacred possession for James Horner. Think twice before allowing the little ones to watch this alone. The fourth movie would be a better DTV sequel based on the franchise for children.",
