I personally think it was one of Diane Keaton's best roles. I wonder what happened to the twins who played Elizabeth though. I'm sure they're all grown up now. Interesting to see what they've turned out to be. However, there are no other credits listed for them. Although I've seen the movie plenty of times, I never knew there was a television show spun off of it. And Joy Behar played Helga??? I'll have to see if there are any copies of the show floating around out there. Great movie, definitely one to add to your collection.",
