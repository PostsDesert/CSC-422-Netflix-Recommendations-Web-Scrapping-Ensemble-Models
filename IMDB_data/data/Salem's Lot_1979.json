        "reviewBody": "I first saw \"Salems Lot\" when I was only 10, and 20 years later I still have the random nightmare because of it. \"Salems Lot\"- the book- was an excellent tale of a small - town being slowly killed - off by vampires, but the 1979 T.V. movie took the story to a whole new level. Tobe Hooper stayed true to the nightmarish Stephen King novel when he directed this movie for television. The movie is so scary (and holds - up today), because of great cast and truly terrifying scenes of goulish vampires. The actors who made up the small - town cast, looked like your everyday working - class people that you might bump into at your local supermarket. That element of quiet small - town folk mixed with the absolute horror / evil of the Stryker character (played by an unnervingly cold James Mason) and Mr. Barlow -- one of the most hideous / terrifying vampires since \"Nosferatu\"-- make \"Salems Lot\" one of the best horror movies that I've ever seen. \n\nI give it 10 out of 10 stars!!!!!!!!!",
