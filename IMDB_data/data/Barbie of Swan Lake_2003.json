        "reviewBody": "I watched this film for the first time years ago. As a child, the movie was so fascinating with beautiful ballet routines. Now as an adult, after watching it again, everything just the same. Barbie as Odette, a bakery's daughter, she is beautiful and has a sweet personality. One day, she sees a unicorn running around her shop. She tries to save the unicorn, and everything starts changing. This film is inspired by one of the most popular ballet, Swan Lake. Although the ending and main plot is totally different. This movie is clearly aimed for children and young viewers. The antagonist, Odile, is really interesting. Her voice is so unique, I still could remember her signature laugh since I was kid. Odette in this Barbie movie is quite strong and brave, I am not very fond of the prince characteristic as he is just too clich√© and not that distinctive from other male partner of Barbie films. Overall, I enjoyed this movie as for young viewers. The story is light and quite enjoyable.",
