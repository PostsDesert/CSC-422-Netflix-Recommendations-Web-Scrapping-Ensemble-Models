The little girl Missie is such a doll and perfect for her role.\n\nThe movie has a bit of \"Little House on the Prairie\" feel to it but has a lot of it's own appeal. All of my friends love this sweet movie, too. Just shows Hollywood that not all of us are into the s_x, blood and gore of most movies out there. Most of us adore the more faith-based, clean, wholesome movies.\n\nMy favorite part that makes me cry every time is when Marty is swinging on the homemade rope swing and is crying and crying over the loss of her husband...awe, just too sweet. And then when Marty walks in on Missy crying over her mothers death and confronts Marty, oh, my heart just breaks.\n\nThis is a movie that the whole family can watch together.",
