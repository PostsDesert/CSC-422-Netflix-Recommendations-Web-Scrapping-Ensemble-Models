The music is catchy, the dancing is impressive, and the story line is great. \n\nSandy and Danny meet in California over summer break and fall in love. Little did they know that they would be attending the same high school when going back to school. Both were surprised and excited to see each other, however they were influenced by there friends at school. It is a question throughout the whole film whether or not Danny and Sandy will be able to regain their love."
