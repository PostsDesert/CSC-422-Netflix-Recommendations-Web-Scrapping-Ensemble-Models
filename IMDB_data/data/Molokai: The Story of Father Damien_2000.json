        "reviewBody": "A stellar supporting cast, rich cinematography and a fine eye for detail all punctuate this near-epic account of the trials and tribulations of the legendary cleric who devoted his life (quite literally) to the care and salvation of a doomed Hawaiian leper colony. Australian David Wenham's most important role to date is set at the turn of the century, when ignorance and greed ruled most levels of secular government. This left the beneficent young priest to suffer alongside his charges while much-needed funding was going to higher-profile healers in richer colonies.\n\nPeter O'Toole is wonderful (in a brief appearance), as are Sam Neill, Leo McKern, Alice Krige, Derek Jacobi and even Kris Kristofferson but, ultimately, it is Wenham's chore to haul this monster ashore. It's evident early on that \"Molokai\" lacks the heart and conviction of the selfless giant who inspired it."
