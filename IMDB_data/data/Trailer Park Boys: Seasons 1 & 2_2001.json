I'm hooked and now looking for videos or DVD's of the show. I've been telling everyone about it, but of course it is hard to explain just how good the show is, some of the subtleties cannot be explained, they have to be seen. One of the best scenes I have come across so far is when Ricky is defending himself in court after the bust of the boys' petrol stealing racket and he requests the judge to allow him to smoke and swear in court... this is a totally original and ground-breaking moment in comedy. On another note I must say I found Randy strangely attractive, and I wished I was in Mr Lahey's shoes!!!! I can't wait for more of this series... keep it coming."
