        "reviewBody": "When I saw The Gin Game on Broadway in 1977 with Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy I thought for sure I had seen the best play ever.\n\nThen when I saw Charles Durning and Julie Harris perform it again on Broadway 20 years later, with my fiancee, I said \"Okay, this is it. This one is the best.\"\n\nThen last night I was flipping channels. I saw the card table and I realized what it was: \"Look, it's The Gin Game!\" I said to my bride, \"Are you kidding me, it's Dick Van Dyck and Mary Tyler Moore.\"\n\nI loved it. I think you can do more with a dramatic play on television, believe it or not.\n\nCheery Dick Van Dyck was an almost convincing Weller, but Mary is too sweet for a Fonsia. I am quite certain I saw Julie Harris stand up, lean over the table, shove the cards in Charles Durning's face and bellow triumphantly \"Gin, F*cking Gin!\". There's no way our dear Mary Richards would ever say that! :-)\n\nThe portrayals in this version are more subtle. You catch more of it in this version: The excellent script doesn't get lost in the commotion.\n\nA great show. Don't miss it!"
