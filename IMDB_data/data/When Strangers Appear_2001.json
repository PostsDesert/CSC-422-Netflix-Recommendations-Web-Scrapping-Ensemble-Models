        "reviewBody": "Granted the premise has been done, but this is a fun suspense film and also as Josh Lucas in it, so add a few stars.\n\nRadha Mitchell is basically a restaurant/motel owner in a desolate Oregon town. She has a customer (Barry Watson, child actor from \"Seventh Heaven\" for anyone who recalls that series, circa 1997).\n\nAnyway, odd things start to occur and her doctor friend becomes a victim. Three strangers apparently on vacation drop in, and proceed to terrorize her.\n\nRadha Mitchell is believable though, and has since been in a Woody Allen film (\"Melinda and Melinda\") so she does a few things right.\n\nWatch for Josh Lucas in recent period piece \"Stolen\" also with Jon Hamm (from \"Mad Men\") a nice suspense film recently made in 2009. Overall give \"Strangers\" a chance. 8/10.",
