The important thing about \"Hostile Waters\" is, that it shows the story from a unusual point of view (the soviet submarine- crew), without high-tech gimmicks and without the \"..it must be a historical fact, because I saw it in a John Wayne Film..\" nonsense (or: \"..because i read it in a Tom Clancy book\"). Oh, and good work by Rutger Hauer, who had a break from B-Movie time. DonÂ´t get me wrong, I like many of his B-Movies, but would somebody please give this man some really big-movie-parts to do ?!.",
