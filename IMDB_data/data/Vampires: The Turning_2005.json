The performances are decent and the action/fight scenes are well choreographed.\n\nThe film moves along at a brisk pace. You won't be bored.\n\nThere's very little sex or T&A, unfortunately, but I won't hold that against it.\n\nWhile no \"Citizen Kane\", This flick is way better than I initially thought it would be. It's a worthy diversion for an afternoon.\n\nWith all the absolutely worthless crap that Hollywood releases nowadays, it's a shame this never got a wide (or any) theatrical release.\n\nIt seems as if this was intended to be the first of a series. If that's the case, I'd definitely check out any sequels.",
