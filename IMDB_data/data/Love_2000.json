        "reviewBody": "To tell the truth, I didn't finish watching the entire series. And this is due to the fact that the first episode was horrible.\n\nThis drama was broadcast at the same time in Japan, Singapore and Philippines etc, as part of the promotion during the \"japan-craze\" in SEA, which is still raging on now.\n\nThe first episode was not interesting at all. My entire hostel block went down to watch it, but many students went off after the second commercial break.\n\nThe series was both slow and unrealistic. Despite the scenes and people being very beautiful, the drama came across as \"plot-less\" and \"meaningless\". Why would love in year 2000 be such a wishy-washy flop?\n\nI wouldn't recommend it to those who like some plot in their shows. For those who like to watch beautiful people, this might be the one for you.\n\n4/10"
