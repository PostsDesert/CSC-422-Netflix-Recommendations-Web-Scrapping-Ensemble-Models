I've seen pretty much all of them and this is the ultimate.It clocks in at 4 hours on 4 tapes but fills up every second with photos,interviews,survivor accounts,and model recreations.The interviews with survivors are a fascinating first hand account,and the documentary has a attention demanding narrative.This is the most complete documentary about the ship and follows it's story from the shipbuilding industry as the \"space race of the infant century\" to her discovery by Robert Ballard.This is an absolute must for any Titanic buff."
