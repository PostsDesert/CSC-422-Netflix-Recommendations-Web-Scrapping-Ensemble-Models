        "reviewBody": "How in the world did I miss \"Deathtrap\" all these years? It's like this movie was designed in a lab for me! If mysteries with a perverse, black comedy bent are your thing (think \"The Last of Sheila\"), then you'll be in heaven with this one. The screenplay, adapted from an ingenious Ira Levin play, is brimming with wonderfully acidic dialogue. Sidney Lumet directs gracefully, keeping things visually interesting and well paced, something never easy to do with play adaptations.\n\nMichael Caine plays a self-absorbed, amoral playwright who's just suffered another massive flop. Caine is emotionally and financially supported by his neurotic but very tolerant wife, Dyan Cannon. When a young theatre student, Christopher Reeve, sends Caine a promising draft of his first play, Caine sees the opportunity to finally achieve another hit. The twists and turns start keep coming from there, and your enjoyment will be greatly enhanced by knowing nothing else in advance.\n\nAll three leads are pitch perfect, with Cannon practically stealing the show in her lovably manic turn as Myra Bruhl. Caine is so deeply despicable that you come to respect his playwright's gift for plotting evil deeds. Reeve gives one of his best performances: he's knowing, relaxed and appealingly low-key while Caine is flaming mad. It also must be said he's unbearably attractive in some breathtakingly tight pants.\n\n\"Deathtrap\" is a true gem in the wonderfully idiosyncratic catalogue of Sidney Lumet. I'm looking forward to digging deeper into his eighties output."
