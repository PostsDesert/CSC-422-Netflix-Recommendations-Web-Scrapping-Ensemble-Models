        "reviewBody": "Just for the curious, this title is on DVD...i found it at sam goody. for $12.99. I also found this stand up of him extremely hilarious and could watch it over and over. It does have a lot of his jokes from Dysfunktional Family but I'm sure a few that have not been heard. I don't think it matters what I see him in, Eddie Griffin just cracks me up. I see from his bio that he has a few movies coming up and I look forward to seeing him on the big screen again. No matter who he teams up with, his movies come out with him on top. He steals the scene every time. Just love this man. I have no idea what else to say because every time I try to post this it tells me that I don't have enough lines for submission so hopefully by the time I get done with this sentence, it'll be ready for posting. Anyhow, Eddie Griffin's Voodoo Child is on DVD. Enjoy!",
