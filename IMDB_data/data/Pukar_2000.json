It is timeless in that the heroism of the Indian Army is showcased and the ultimately sacrificial love story of the two main characters is portrayed in a manner that grips your attention from beginning to end. Om Puri and the rest of the supporting cast made this a film to be watched time and again. The action, plot, music, scenery and direction helped to make this a great film. Pukar /Call is a worthwhile watch. Enjoy!",
