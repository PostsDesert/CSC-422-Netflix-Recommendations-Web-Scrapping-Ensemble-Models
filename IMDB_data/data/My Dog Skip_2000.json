        "reviewBody": "Here's a bit of an unusual film: a modern-day movie made more for adults than kids but could be equally enjoyed by both. There are 9 \"damns\" and a few other profanities, but nothing earth-shaking.\n\nIt's simply the memoirs of Willie Morris, a southern boy who wound up as a famous writer and editor of Harper's Magazine. Being that magazine is pretty Liberal, you get Liberal slants in the movie (racial and anti-war sentiments) but nothing heavy-handed.\n\nAs a good story does, it makes you care about the characters, especially the lead one. In here it's \"Willie\" and his dog \"Skip.\" Early shots of Skip growing up - measured in how he related to the toilet bowl - are funny. You also care about his parents and are glad when the dad (Kevin Bacon) softens his stance on things. As a guy, I appreciated just looking at Diane Lane. What a gorgeous face!\n\nThe cinematography is pure southern charm and looks great on DVD. It's not all sweetness. There are some angry moments and some sad ones, to be sure. In summary, however, a nice film.....pure and simple.",
