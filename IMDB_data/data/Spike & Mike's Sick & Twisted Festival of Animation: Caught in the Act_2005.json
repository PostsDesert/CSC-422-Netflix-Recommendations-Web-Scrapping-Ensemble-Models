        "reviewBody": "I was a teenager in 1990 when this film was set and The Stone Roses formed a backdrop to my angsty early 90s teenage years. The use of music, clothing, hairstyles etc. in this film is very evocative and true to the era and positively influenced my score above what it probably really deserves.\n\nThe story itself doesn't really know what it wants to be. Most of the film is light comedy romp, a fun celebration of youth, but after coming to a seemingly ecstatic climax, we get an unexpectedly harsh comedown of an ending. Whilst this improves the film overall, a bit too much drama is injected in too short a time which jars with the tone and pace of rest of the film.",
