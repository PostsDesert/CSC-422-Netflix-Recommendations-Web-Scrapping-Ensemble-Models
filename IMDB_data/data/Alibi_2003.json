Shot in the usual made-for-TV Brit no frills style with nonstop dialogue, this very civilized flick is sufficiently busy and twisty to hold interest for most of the 2.5 hour run. On the upside is a solid cast offering good performances. On the downside is mediocre production value and no subtitles or CC. Probably a worthwhile small screener for those into contemporary Brit dramas. (B-)",
