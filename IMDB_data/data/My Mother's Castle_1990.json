It's French... don't be afraid... this film makes complete sense to any audience and is not art for art's sake.\n\nBut hey, you wouldn't be reading these comments if you weren't intelligent and discerning, so subtitles wouldn't be a problem, I know.\n\nReally, give it a try. The other comments on this movie are absolutely correct. It is completely charming and will hold you in it's influence for the whole movie. Mostly the story of a the relationship between a small boy and a girl he meets. Well-observed, hilariously funny in parts. Exquisite acting of the first order. You'll never forget it. Give it a try.",
