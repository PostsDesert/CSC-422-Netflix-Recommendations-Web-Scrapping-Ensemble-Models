I realize it was up against a former multiple winner, but too bad there's not room for the History Channel projects, as well as shows on some of the less touted channels and less expensive projects. Maybe the financial aspect should be considered along with the creative and technical angles.\n\nDo HBO and PBS have to be the winners all the time? Maybe someday the voters will watch something other than the main channels. Hopefully, with more new and good shows on some of the lesser channels, this will change in the future.",
