This film is so far on the wrong side of that line,you can't even see it from there.\n\nIt's a shame, because this could have been a good movie. I like everything about, except for the HORRIBLE over-acting of its star. Bruce Campbell is the undisputed master at this style of acting, and Rob Bogue tries so hard to imitate him, you have to wonder why they didn't just get the real thing.\n\n Call this one a missed opportunity. 4 out of 10.",
