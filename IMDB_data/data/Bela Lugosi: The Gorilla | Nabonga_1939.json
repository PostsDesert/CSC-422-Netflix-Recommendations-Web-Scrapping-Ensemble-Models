        "reviewBody": "Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla (1952)\n\n* 1/2 (out of 4)\n\nDean Martin and Jerry Lewis wannabes Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo fall out of a plane on land on an island where a mad scientist (Bela Lugosi) is doing bizarre experiments on monkeys. Pretty soon the two friends have sisters in love with them and all sort of other weirdness.\n\nBELA LUGOSI MEETS A BROOKLYN GORILLA is an awful movie from start to finish. Again, I repeat. This is an awful movie in just about every way imaginable. With that said, I also find it to be incredibly entertaining and quite often when I'm looking for a low- budget bad movie to watch, I come back to this one. While it's not as entertaining as something like PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE it's still a highly enjoyable film.\n\nPerhaps I should repeat that the film is awful so no one goes in expecting something good or somewhat good. The entire idea of the film is rather routine, clich√©d and stupid but there's just something weirdly entertaining about watching Mitchell and especially Petrillo do their act. It's reported that Jerry Lewis sued Petrillo and it's really no shock because it's pretty much an exact copy only much more annoying. The comic back-and-forth here isn't funny yet it's so unfunny that you can't help but be entertained.\n\nThen there's the Lugosi element. I know many people put down his roles in the Ed Wood movies but this had to be one of the lowest points for the actor. He pretty much does what he can with the role but he's basically just standing or sitting around and screaming or talking with the monkey. If you're a fan of Lugosi you're probably going to feel sorry for him appearing in this but at the same time it's still rather fun to see him surrounded by all the craziness.\n\nAs a comedy this film is quite horrible but it remains entertaining to me. I don't know, perhaps I enjoy torturing myself but sometimes films are just so bad or different or strange that you can't help but be drawn to them. BELA LUGOSI MEETS A BROOKLYN GORILLA has a very silly title but it perfectly matches what you're going to be seeing in the picture."
