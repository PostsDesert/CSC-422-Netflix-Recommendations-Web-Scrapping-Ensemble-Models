Aside from that, was done well to mix action, drama, and catchy phrases that will get you yelling EXIST!!! during the movie. Imaginative demons, fresh take on terrorism, and new look at walking the fine line between being human and monster. Some funny parts (oh look a flower) and some sad parts. Forget the world you live in, because this universe immerses you within it. Only flaws I can see is the usual stereotypical Japanese *le gasp* moments that annoy me a lot, and the idea that deploying regular cops to fight these indestructible demons MAKES ZERO SENSE!!!! But the thing is, this anime will make you forget logic for a bit, and suck you into the story and action very well. It's like Star Wars, you watch it 10000x and you'll see the flaws, but the first 5x you see it, you won't be bothered, you'll just love it!",
