Actress Jeanne Tripplehorn and Corin Nemec do an excellent job in the portraying the characters of Lucinda and Ellis Pond very well. The riddles through out the entire film were great. The movie makes you think and wonder who the killer really is and you don't expect it to be who it truly is. A very good film with lots of good twists. Director, John Badham, has done a great job in showing the flashbacks which proceed throughout the entire film about what happened to Ellis and Lucinda when they were still children. All in all a very good film, a thriller that is worth watching.",
