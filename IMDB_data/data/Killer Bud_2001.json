It's a terrible waste to see some old and what should be retired actors act in a B-movie like this. God. I found this movie for $1.99 in my grocery store. I only bought it because it disguises it's self as a silly stoner movie. I'm stoned, and it's still not funny. What does that say about it? \n\nWho are most of these actors anyway? Aside from Bud from Married with Children and the guy who acts in The Stand, I don't recognize a single one of them. I even read their bios and I don't even remember them from what little else I've seen on their resumes.\n\nI've paused it 6 times so I can go do other stuff to amuse myself. This is ridiculous.\n\nOh Lord. Now they're discussing how they think of each other when they're masturbating alone. That's not funny.\n\nMy advice: Rent Napoleon Dynamite instead.",
