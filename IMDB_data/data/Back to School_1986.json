        "reviewBody": "Rodney Dangerfield (RIP) has got a specific and recognizable sense of humor. Some like it , some not . I happen to like it , so I also liked \"Back to school\" . The whole movie is basically Dangerfield's tour de force . He's almost constantly making a snappy comments or fun jokes. He's rarely not on the screen. This doesn't mean the movie not offers him support.\n\nSam Kinison is fun as professor Terguson history teacher . The first lesson of history of America is HILARIOUS . I was crying from laughter. I wish they give him more screen time. I was surprised by appearance of young Robert Downey Jr. as Derek . He's quite a colorful character with his weird clothes , hairstyles and beliefs. I also loved Burt Young (Paulie from \"Rocky\") as Lou - Thornton's driver and best friend. His strong and street wise. \n\nPaxton Whitehead (Philip Barbay) makes for a nice snobbish economy teacher. Keith Gordon is likable as shy Jason Melon â€“ Dangerfield's son. Sally Kellerman (Diane) and Terry Farell (Valerie) are both lovely ladies. M. Emmett Walsh plays coach Turnbull . William Zabka (the bully from \"Karate kid\") once again plays bully (Chas). There is also special guest appearance, but I won't spoil the surprise. \n\nThere are some great songs here : Jude Cole \"Back to school\" , Oingo Boingo \"Dead man's party\" , Aretha Franklin \"Respect\" and Rodney Dangerfield's version of \"Twist and shout\" .\n\nHarold Ramis (\"Groundhog day\" , \"National lampoons vacation\" , \"Ghostbusters\") is one of the writers . He and Dangerfield worked earlier together in \"Caddyshack\" . There is even a picture from \"Caddyshack\" in the opening credits of the movie.\n\nThis is Dangerfield's best movie from the 80's and best overall. It's one of best 80's comedies. It was one of the first comedies to earn 100 millions worldwide . That tells you something. Oh , and don't forget about the famous jump at the pool.\n\nI give it 7/10.",
