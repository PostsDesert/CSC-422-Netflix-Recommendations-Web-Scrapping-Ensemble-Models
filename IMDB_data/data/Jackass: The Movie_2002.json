Its a movie that people either hate it or love it instantly. And I'm a proud person to say that I love it. Some funny scenes, gross-out scenes, and some that are just... TOO GROSS! But after the credits roll, you got to think, \"How could they possibly do that?\" Just to make people laugh. 9.5 stars out of 10"
