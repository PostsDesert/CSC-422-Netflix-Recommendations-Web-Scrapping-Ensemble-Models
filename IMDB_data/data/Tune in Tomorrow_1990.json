        "reviewBody": "I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The jokes about Albanians were hilarious and Peter Falk's character was the most ridiculous. Just one person creating so many multi dimensional characters. Especially the fire scene. Very dramatic. Keanu Reeves and Barbara Hershey play very good characters with romantic interests in each other. Well you end up rooting for Keanu's character since he has such an endearing innocence. The backdrop, scenery and the costumes are very colorful and convincing. The movie is a great joy to watch. It brings light to a entertainment medium that is hard to imagine in this digital age.",
