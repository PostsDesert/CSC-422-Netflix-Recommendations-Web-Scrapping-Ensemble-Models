Better watched at home than on the big screen, this movie is light and very funny. I guarantee that you will laugh at least a couple of times. The humor is at times twisted and at times offensive but it's not too perverted. You'll enjoy this funny look at the world of women seen through the eyes of the men. However, if watching with children, please note that the movie does contain nude scenes and foul language.",
