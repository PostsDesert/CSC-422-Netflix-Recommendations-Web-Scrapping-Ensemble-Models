In this case it was the soft-core trilogy that has an ongoing story development throughout the series. I'm not sure this was intended as a trilogy from the get-go (and I didn't bother to look up what this was based on), but it ended up as one that's for sure.\n\nThe acting is OK I guess for a movie that relies more on nudity and pretend intercourse. The second movie was the best story wise (for me), though I'm not sure you would want to watch it for that or the erotic scenes that are in there. I did fast forward them, to get to the story, which wasn't as pleasing as it should be (then again, I might have gotten that wrong).",
