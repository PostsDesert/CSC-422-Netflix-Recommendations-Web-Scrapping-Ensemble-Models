In a role that seemed meant for a plump sexpot as herself (who isn't so plump anymore), Ricci fully embodies the conniving attitude of Deedee. Told in a rather unusual manner, this film featured some deadpan performances by Johnny Galecki, Lyle Lovett and Lisa Kudrow. While the film needed some help in regards to the pacing and structure, it was still a fun movie to watch, especially in regards to Deedee's voice overs.",
