What saves this movie (at least in its first hour) is its sense of (black) humor.Although it's sometimes a bit over the top (the nursery school scene is sheer bad taste:it would have taken John Waters to treat it successfully),there are plenty of funny scenes if you do not take them seriously:I particularly dig the \"Bergman\" lines.\n\nUnfortunately,the last thirty minutes take us back to \"the invincible super hero who single-handedly fights evil \".But he was a marine,we are told.\n\nSome kind of remake of the director's \"de lift\" (early eighties)with a more comfortable budget.\n\nIt's pretty good entertainment but you'd better choose Dick Maas's \"Amsterdamned\" instead."
