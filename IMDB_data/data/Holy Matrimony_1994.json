        "reviewBody": "The movie concerns on a thieves pair named Havana and Peter(Patricia Arquette, Tate Donovan) rob a country fair proprietary(Richard Riehle)and fled to only place where no one look for them. Both determine which the best way to avoid detection is to blend with the Hutterite community, an Amish-alike society and where Peter was raised by his parents(Armin Mueller Stahl, Lois Smith). Peter hides his loot in a secret hiding location, but then he soon dies in a car crash. His little boy brother named Ezequiel(Joseph Gordon Lewitt) is called to replace him and marry to Havana. She has to adjust to the new life style and his feeling for the boy. And end up interwoven a sensitive undercurrent of caring and she learns how to love all over again. Meanwhile, they're pursued by two agents(John Schuck, Courtney Vance).\n\nThis is an enjoyable comedy with good feeling, entertaining, agreeable humor and language is suitable for all. The main issue about this movie is from how she tries to adapt the new life whilst keeping up the presence of being a good woman . It's enough remarkable in portraying the Hutterite way of life sympathetically and the likable relationship of the juvenile marriage. It's understandable why it was not great success in the theatre, as it has not spectacular special effects , isn't a blockbuster , but for the television set , its's just what is required. The film takes parts here and there from ¨Witness¨(Peter Weir with Harrison Ford) and ¨For richer and poorer¨(Bryan Spicer with Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley). Colorful cinematography by Bukowski and emotive musical score by Bruce Broughton. The motion picture is professionally directed by the famous Leonard Nimoy, Spock . He's a good director of comedy-drama(Good mother, Funny about love, 3 men and a baby), Sci-Fi(Star Trek III and V) and occasionally for television(Deadly games,Night gallery, T.J. Hooker). Rating : Average but bemusing.",
