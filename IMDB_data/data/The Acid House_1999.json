It is like a cross between \"Happiness\" and \"Requiem for a Dream,\" with magic and surrealism to boot. The Scottish accents are incomprehensible (thank goodness for the subtitles) but fascinating. \"Trainspotting\" is, I think, a better film overall, but this one sure gains points for audacity, intensity, and wit.",
