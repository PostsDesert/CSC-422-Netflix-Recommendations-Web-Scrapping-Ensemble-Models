Rowan Atkinson is the obnoxious, unpleasant comedian who torments Jeff. Emma Thompson is a pretty, deadpan nurse who gives Jeff's life hope and meaning when he falls in love with her and vice versa. After parting ways with Atkinson, Jeff lands the lead role in \"Elephant!\", a musical version of \"The Elephant Man\", in which he plays, of course, the Elephant Man. Jeff's eternal happiness is nearly thwarted by a cute co-star who threatens his romance with Emma Thompson. Will Jeff come out on top? Of course he does. This isn't \"The Fly\" after all. \n\nToo long but still very funny, with Jeff well cast as the title character. Atkinson is a great antagonist and Emma Thompson has her moments of inspired deadpan humor. And of course, the actual \"Elephant\" sequences are a riot.\n\n\"Vengeance shall BE MINE!\" Jeff as Dexter King, AKA: The Tall Guy."
