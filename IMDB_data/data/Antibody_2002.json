        "reviewBody": "Echoing the majority of comments here, this is a horrible ripoff of 'Fantastic Voyage'. With the exception of a few lines added for comic relief, the film as someone else suggested would be best used as fodder for a revived film-spoofing voice-over show. Robbin Givens and the newscaster looked a bit pleased to be seen in anything, but the rest of the cast seemed to be in pain (understandably). Heinricksen appears to have a hemorrhoid problem during his FBI review, or maybe he is just looking for the stage exit door to escape his agreement to do this film. It seems every opportunity was taken to waste chances to choose logical, practical, entertaining or otherwise valuable approaches to each scene. Some of the most ludicrous: seats with no harnesses, Star Wars fighting within the blood vessels, a terrorist who wakes up but does not even flinch during during several deep needles in the neck as he pretends to sleep, and the entire 'deactivation' of the detonator scene! Why did Zabka leave Mr. Miagi behind--we needed him to kick this one into the trash!"
