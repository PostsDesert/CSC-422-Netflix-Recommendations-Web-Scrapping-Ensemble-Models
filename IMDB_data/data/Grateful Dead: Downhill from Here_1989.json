        "reviewBody": "This was not the last great Grateful Dead show, but was the pinnacle of the last great Grateful Dead Tour. Not long after this show was filmed, Brent Mydland died and was replaced by the way-overmatched-by-the-moment-and-the-material Vince Welnick and, well, it was all downhill from there.\n\nStill, this was an amazing concert awesomely performed. Its only drawback, which is true of most of the Dead's concert films is that it is unlikely to appeal to anyone who is not a Deadhead or at least a serious music aficionado. The tunes are very long and very jammed out. People whose only concept of music is a three minute pop song are just not going to get it."
