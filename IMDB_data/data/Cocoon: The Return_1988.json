        "reviewBody": "Bernie Lefkowitz is alone at the senior home. He misses Rose and even tries to commit suicide. Jack Bonner is running his cheesy glass-bottom boat tours. Ben Luckett contacts his grandson David about returning. The Antareans are returning to Earth to retrieve their left-behind endangered cocoons. Ben and Mary, Art and Bess Selwyn, Joe and Alma Finley have also returned with their alien friends. Kitty reignites the old feelings from Jack. Scientists from the St. Petersburg Oceanographic Institute have discovered one of the cocoons. Lead scientist Sara does an MRI and discovers the alien within. They open the cocoon. Soon the military is involved and a rescue is planned.\n\nThis sequel is almost entirely unnecessary. The biggest positive is that it got these legends back together for a final outing. There are some weird stuff going on and the characters are mostly split into two groups. The seniors are basically left to their own story. It starts with making Bernie's suicide attempt a joke. There is the weird senior pregnancy. Of course, there is the senior Space Jam and the alien drunken energy ball. Any comedy comes with a good dose of awkwardness. I certainly understand the studio green-lighting this and the old-timers get to return for some fun. It simply needs a better script and a better director to make this work. The original doesn't demand a sequel and this is not a good one.",
