        "reviewBody": "Considering the usual level of Made-For-Playboy movies, \"Allyson is Watching\" represents a landmark exception. Jennifer Hammon has the smile and charm of Sandra Bullock and her straight-forward performing style elevates this low budget (simulated) sex film beyond the norm. Allyson is an aspiring young actress who learns about sexual matters by spying on her prostitute neighbor and fighting off the advances of a pushy acting partner, an acting coach of questionable integrity, and a landlord with evil on his mind. Hammon jumped from this film to a regular role on the ABC soap \"Port Charles,\" so you are not likely to see her in this type of film again. Now that she's moved on to Prime Time guest appearances, she's an actress worth watching.",
