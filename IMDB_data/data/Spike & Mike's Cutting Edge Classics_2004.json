The story of 4 guys wanting to start a band always sounds clich√©. \"Maybe if we start a band we can be big and tour the world!\" Not exactly like this here. They just pure and simply want to give there demo to Ian Brown which is somewhat unrealistic in my opinion but you know what? It's different. No one else thinks to do this with a plot line. It is a change. Whether it's language, accent, scenery etc. I just got really interested on every characters development. Knowing they can do better than what they are already doing. Working with the sources they have to build up a sense of what recording music and producing music is like. I give this a solid 10 for that!",
