You had 3 stories going on at once---switching from one to the other---involving dramas that were happening to 3 of the nurses (high school age girls). One out of the three was somewhat interesting. There were action things in the film, but despite this the film moved slow and felt long. There was the required nudity but it wasn't a big deal. The comedy was corny. Yet overall there was entertainment value. If somebody asked me, \"Would you rather have watched this title or not watched it,\" I would reply in the negative.",
