Brilliant characters, an intriguing storyline, hilarious incidents, sex, violence, the works...\n\nI gave the movie a 5 because Robert Patrick and Burt Reynolds were absolutely hysterical and on-point (I'm sure THEY actually READ the book), but aside from those two gems this movie was a disgrace.\n\nWhat happened to the plot?!? What happened to like half the story?!? What happened to my self respect?!? Why change the ending?!? The story was enthralling and thoroughly enjoyable when I read the book, the movie (breasts considered) not so much..\n\nThere's a gratuitous 3 minute topless dancing scene, followed by 3 minutes of Demi and the little girl crying and being superdramatic. CHOOSE which audience you're marketing this movie towards! Women won't respect a nonsense T&A fest and men don't want to see a bunch of sappy overdramatics when the movie was advertised like a softcore porno flick.\n\nThe fact that a BOOK about strippers was exponentially better than the movie.. that's saying something.\n\n\n* Anonymous Disgrunted Hiaasen Fan\n",
