        "reviewBody": "Koi Mil Gaya is a nice film for the entire family, but mostly for children. Not much does it offer to adults. It does not mean the film is bad or something, I really enjoyed it for being a very well-made movie, but it's just not a film anyone would want to watch twice. To its credit, this is one of the only sci-fi films made in Hindi cinema, and it has succeeded as such. It benefits from great music, effective special effects, but above all, Hrithik Roshan's extraordinary performance as a mentally disabled young man. It also has lovely appearances from other actors, including Preity Zinta's light yet great portrayal of a modern young woman who learns to communicate with Hrithik's Rohit, and Rekha's moving act of his mother who is in a daily struggle with her son's defect. But these ladies succeed because they are two actresses of great screen presence. Otherwise the film was clearly made by Rakesh Roshan for his son. I frankly get a bit angered that all three of his films starring his son did not give any notable scope to other actors but were mainly created to promote Hrithik. The film is considered to be revolutionary, while clearly it is not. We had Mr India in 1987 which was in my view better at its time. Koi Mil Gaya is similar to E.T, but frankly pales in comparison. This Jaadoo, while a sweet creature, is plastic. BTW, he can't act (just kidding!). Anyway, the film is worth watching for its innovative concept and light, endearingly childish script.",
