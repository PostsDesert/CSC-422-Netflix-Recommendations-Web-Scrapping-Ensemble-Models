I mean the whole story is I think related to that \"you look like your sister in this light boy I could go for your sister right now\" thing. only reappropriated by romance lol romantic beyond all possibility. I felt so sad after I saw it but then I met a guy at a gas station breaking several months of being fed up with the menfolk. a weird coincidence anyway this is really a magical movie. and I met the director too and he's really sweet. I want to buy the DVD and read the screenplay.\n\noh maybe I should mention the actors are all so hot without looking plastic in the least. Je fais le freak out par que ce film est si formidable.\n\nit occurs to me this could be the most deliriously romantic movie I've ever seen. meaning like more potent, worse, if you will, than any hollywood movie. and you can't do anything but just lap it up...",
