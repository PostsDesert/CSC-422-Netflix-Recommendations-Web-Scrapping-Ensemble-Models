The most entertaining movie i've watched this year is most definitely this one it actually keeped me guessing up till the end.Even though this is to be a physcological thriller it is also funny here and there and is also kind of sad.With this said Wicker Park is definitely worth your money.This is not really a family movie but it's good and with Josh Hartnett in it even better.Don't wait to long to watch it,you'll like it."
