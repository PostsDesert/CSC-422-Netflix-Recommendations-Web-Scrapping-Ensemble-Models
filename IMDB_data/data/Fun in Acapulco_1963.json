The fact that he is in them makes them more than they would normally be. This entry is not that bad - I mean it. You have Ursula Andress, always a plus, and all those location shots. Plus the number \"Bossa Nova Baby\" is great. Like this movie? Of course I do - the man is known as the King for a reason, and proper respect must be paid to the man."
