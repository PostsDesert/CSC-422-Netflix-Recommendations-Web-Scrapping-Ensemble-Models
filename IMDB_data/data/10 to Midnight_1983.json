        "reviewBody": "10 to Midnight (1983) was another one of old stone face's exploitation films that he seemed to crank out every other month during the 80's. The two Chucks (Norris and Bronson) seemingly released a film like every other week. That's what we need, bi-weekly cheesy action whitesploitation movies. Well Charlie was up to the task in this one and Cannon was ready to foot the bill.\n\nA sexual confused serial killer is stalking co-eds. The killer has Charlie stumped. Along with a new partner, he stalks the streets looking for Mr. Goodbar er... the mad manic maniac!! Old Chuck seems to be on the right trail but the law that he's sworn to upheld swing both ways.\n\nPure sleaze. If you're looking for a good movie look elsewhere, this is grade z Charles Bronson. Slumming for a paycheck whilst losing any creditability he had as a serious actor. But their are folks who actually dig Mr. Emotion earning his pay acting in terrible films. I happen to be one of those. I can't tell by his \"acting\" but Mr. Bronson seems to dig his new role in Hollywood.\n\nFor fans only.",
