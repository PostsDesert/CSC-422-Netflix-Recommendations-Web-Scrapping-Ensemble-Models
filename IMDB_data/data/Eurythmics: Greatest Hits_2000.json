Two-time Grammy award-winners, the Eurythmics have sold over 75 million records, worldwide.\n\nBetween Annie Lennox's power-house vocals (and cynical, barbed-wire lyrics) and Dave Stewart's catchy guitar-riffs and tuneful melodies, this \"dynamite\" dynamic duo have certainly delivered some of the most memorable and electrifying pop tunes in all of rock-n-roll history.\n\nThis entertaining, 90-minute DVD is a first-rate collection of 20 music-videos showcasing the Eurythmics' mega-successful, 10-year collaboration with MTV.",
