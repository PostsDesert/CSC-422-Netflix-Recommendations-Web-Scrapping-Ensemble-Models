        "reviewBody": "Goldfinger is without a doubt my favorite James Bond film ever, and one of my favorite movies of all time period. It is truly spectacular from start to finish, and remains to be an immortal classic.\n\nGoldfinger is about a powerful man known as Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe) hatches a plan to raid Fort Knox and demolish the world economy. James Bond (Sean Connery) must stop his plan and use his brand new Aston Martin car to take out the bad guys.\n\nSuch an excellent film. It's story is easily the best, straightforward, and clever out of all the Bond films, the pacing was incredibly fast, and this was really the first Bond film to have high scale action. The first two were the beginning, but this is where action kicks in and is outstanding.\n\nThe acting in this one is also the best. Easily Sean Connery's greatest performance and his best movie ever. Gert Fröbe was awesome as Goldfinger as well. The new Bond girl, Pussy Galore, isn't my favorite Bond girl, but she was still amazing, and Honor Blackman was very suitable for the role.\n\nOne last thing is this is the film that introduces the Aston Martin car, and it truly makes the film shine with all the cool gadgets it has and the tricks it can do. Probably my favorite gadget that James Bond gets to have.\n\nOverall, I love Goldfinger. It always has and always will be my number one favorite Bond film. I don't think anything can beat it."
