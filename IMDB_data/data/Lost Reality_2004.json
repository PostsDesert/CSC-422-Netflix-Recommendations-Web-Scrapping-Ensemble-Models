But we all watched it anyway, and while us in our drunken state thought it was real at first, soon realized it was a bunch of staged \"reality shows\" which makes it even more hilarious.\n\nThe Amazing Racist was definitely the funniest. But overall the puking scene was great and it wasn't a good movie by any means. but it definitely was entertaining.\n\n3/5 Stars\n\n-Rent It"
