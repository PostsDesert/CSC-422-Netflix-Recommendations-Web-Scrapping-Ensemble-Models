To me it was more or less one of them B films that are just made to show people having sex. Now Judy Thompson played a very good part and some very sexy parts. The thing is, she does it with her boy friend. Then her girl friend. Then another friend and his wife. And then a cop. So I don't see where the name of this Movie comes from. I think it should have been called Sex Tonight."
