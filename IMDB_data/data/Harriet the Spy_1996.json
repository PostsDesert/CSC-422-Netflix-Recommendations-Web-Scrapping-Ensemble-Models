I think this movie is underrated and it should have recieved more than it did. I read the book and from what I can remember, this movie resembles the book well. The\n\nsupporting cast including Rosie O'Donnell is great. The characterization is also well done including the characters Sport, Janie and the wise cracker Marion\n\nHawthorne. Harriet the Spy has a great mix of comedy, drama and tragedy. I\n\nrecommend this movie to any young one and if you've haven't read the book, I\n\nwould recommend you do or you might not understand this movie. *** out of ****"
