        "reviewBody": "\"Assignment: Miami Beach\" is the first one in the franchise that doesn't have Steve Guttenberg, and I've got mixed feelings about that. In one way it's sort of a blessing, because we can finally spend some quality time with Lassard in this one. George Gaynes has always been the best actor of any installment's cast, so it's nice to see a sequel where everything revolves around him. Granted, all he really gets to do is have people fall over a bunch of times, but somehow he still makes it work. On the other hand, the movie clearly misses a decent \"straight man\" to counterbalance all the oddballs. I guess that was new guy Matt McCoy's task, but given that the guy has no screen presence whatsoever and barely made the final cut it doesn't quite work. Overall though, I didn't hate this. I mean, they do the same seven or eight bits they do in all the other ones, but here they do them on a different location! Michael Winslow does his Bruce Lee schtick for the fifth time in five movies, but now on a different location! I was sorta surprised Miami didn't have a Blue Oyster Bar, to be honest. \"Police Academy 5\" is not the greatest movie you'll ever see, but it'll give you about what you would expect.",
