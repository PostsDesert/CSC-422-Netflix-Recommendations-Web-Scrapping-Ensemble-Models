This compelling and profound stir of taboo makes quick work of my knees and I've grown quite fond of it. The acting in this movie was shockingly surreal. Their ability to guide the undertones in effect are rather impressive and my attempts at criticism can only accumulate around the sound editing in which some transitional music and whatnot seemed lesser than par. Nothing in this piece has been overworked or emphasized to exhaustion. I am more than impressed by the simplicity that guides an endless river of emotion in which it captures the one thing.. the one word so overused, abused and neglected; love.",

From the time she was a child, Sandra was fascinated by the dead. A fascination that remains unfulfilled, until she is propelled by fate into the world of the mildly sinister Mr. Wallis, proprietor of the local funeral home. Now, at the side of her mentor, Sandra's innermost desires will finally find their tortured expression. But her new-found serenity is shattered when a handsome young medical student learns her secret, and finds himself drawn into her tangled web of ever-darkening desire and erotic obsession.",
