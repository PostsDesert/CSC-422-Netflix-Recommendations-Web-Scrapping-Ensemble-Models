        "reviewBody": "I have sometimes confused The Lost Continent to the 1951 dinosaur movie of the same name. It is rather enjoyable though.\n\nA tramp steamer with a motley collection of passengers and plenty of barrels of a dangerous explosive goes on an expedition and ends on an uncharted island in the Sargasso Sea which seems to be a graveyard for ships. When there, they discover the land populated by giant crabs, a giant scorpion, man-eating seaweed and survivors of the Spanish Inquisition! After several of the party and Inquisition are killed by the monsters and the explosive chemical, they set off and head back to civilization, along with some of the Inquisition.\n\nHammer made this movie in 1968 and I taped it when it came on Channel 4 some years ago. Some of the monsters look rather cheap and the movie has a good theme song.\n\nThe cast includes Eric Porter, Suzanna Leigh, Nigel Stock and Dana Gillespie.\n\nThis movie is worth a look at. Enjoyable.\n\nRating: 3 and a half stars out of 5."
