Inspired by the Dudley Moore movie Arthur, this Prakash Mehra directed movie is Indianised. And done very well! After Namak Halaal and Muqadder ka Sikander this is my fave Amitabh-Prakash Mehra movie. The movie costars Jaya Pradha, Smita Patil, Pran, Om Prakash, Ranjeet, Satyen Kappu. Even Suresh Oberoi is watchable in a cameo. The guy who was Amitabh jr in Muqadder ka Sikander (Mayur i think) also has a part in this movie. Music by Bappi Lahiri is okay. Dede pyaar de and Mujhe Naulakha manga de re were hits. Def worth a watch. Even worth repeating.",
