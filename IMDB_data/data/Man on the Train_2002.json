Both men are bored with their current lives but are intrigued by the other's.\n\nThis slow burner may not be interesting enough for many, certainly not quick enough for most. But its nevertheless a fascinating \"little\" film and character study. It works in the play between these two men from different worlds, who grow to aspire to see what its like to be the other person. There's no giant twist, no supernatural catch at the end, so don't be expecting it - just enjoy it for the wry, vivid look into the rapport between these two men with nothing in common.\n\n3.5/5. A treat."
