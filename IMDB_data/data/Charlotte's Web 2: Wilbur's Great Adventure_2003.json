        "reviewBody": "Well the first Charlotte's web was a beautiful film it was wonderful masterpiece and rather underrated 70s classic. I remember enjoying it and loving the jokes and the hidden message in that film. When I heard about their was sequel to the first film. I was looking forward to it, I rented it out on DVD at the video store and I thought it was going to be as good as the first. But it sucked it was so boring. And here are the reasons for it what happened to characters like Geoffrey the baby goose and the old sheep and Fern's brother. And what happened to Wilbur every one's favorite pig in the first one he was brave and kind but in this one he is complete loser and scared of every thing the fox as the villain was only likable character in this film. This movie has got nothing to do with the first film what so ever but when it does, it's are total slap stick in the face. \n\nThis movie is such a let down to the original film and this one is so forgettable the only good thing about this film was the soundtrack 2/10",
