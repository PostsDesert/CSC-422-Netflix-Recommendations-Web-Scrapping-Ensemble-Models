SANDBOX is a comedy/drama that deals with the condition of the neglected housewives of the seventies. Streisand is absolutely wonderful in the lead. If this film had been seen by a wider audience, then you can bet she would have received an Oscar nomination.\n\nAlthough the frequent fantasy/daydream scenes are somewhat uneven in quality, Streisand's touching and believable performance will keep you glued.\n\nWhen originally released in 1972, SANDBOX was lost in the shadow of Streisand's blockbuster WHAT'S UP, DOC? (released the same year). >\n\nUP THE SANDBOX deserves to be rediscovered on video. Give it a try.\n\nMy score: 8 out of 10."
