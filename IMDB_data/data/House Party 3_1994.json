The only characters that returned from the first two House Party movies are Kid, Play and Cindy. Also, this film doesn't pick up where the second movie left off. It doesn't show how Kid and Cindy break up, or where Kid meets his new girl friend. It doesn't even tell you where Play's new car came from! This movie didn't have the magic that made the first two films so great. I didn't like this film at all. It was lousy, boring and a big disappointment. It didn't even seem like one of the House Parties. I give this movie an extremely rare 1 out of 10. I've only seen it once and I wouldn't watch it again if you paid me."
