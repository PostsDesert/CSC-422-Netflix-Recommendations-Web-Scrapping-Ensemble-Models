        "reviewBody": "Elliot Slater grew up with submissive urges during his Australian childhood with the hot maid. His adult relationships have not worked. He's a professional photographer. At the airport, he takes pictures of diamond smuggler Nina Blackstone (Iman) dressed as an airline stewardess and her cohort Omar. LAPD undercover officers Sheila Kingston (Rosie O'Donnell) and Fred Lavery (Dan Aykroyd) are hunting the diamond smuggling ring. Nina and Omar tries to track down Elliot to get back the photos. There are no known photos of Omar and the cops are after Elliot as well. Elliot signs up for a week on the island of Eden as a submissive. He is followed by the smugglers and the cops. The island is owned by Dr. Martin Helifax (Hector Elizondo) and run by dominatrix Mistress Lisa Emerson (Dana Delany).\n\nO'Donnell is annoying in this one. She needs somebody to rein her in and Aykroyd is the last person to do that. They are the unfunny comedic relief. The premise is horribly manufactured. The island is cheesy. Paul Mercurio is a weak lead and Dana Delany doesn't fit as a dominatrix. It is awkward and silly. There are a lot of naked people and non of it is erotic or funny. Sexy has never been more boring. I don't know how crappy is the Anne Rice novel and Garry Marshall is a complete fail here.",
