Rich in storyline and in cinematography this documentary film is much like what you would see on your local PBS station or on the Discovery Channel except the splendor of the massive IMAX screen makes this as if you are actually swimming with the fish and the sharks in this underwater adventure. \n\nIf you love nature, oceanography, or watching tropical fish and other animals this movie is for you.",
