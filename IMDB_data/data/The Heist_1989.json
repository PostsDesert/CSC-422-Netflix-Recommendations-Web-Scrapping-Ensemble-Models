Usually, I like to watch the planning, but that wasn't the feature here. he had everything in his head and didn't appear to share with anyone, except maybe his girlfriend Sheila (Wendy Hughes).\n\nThis wasn't about money. It was about revenge against the guy who sent him to prison (Tom Skerritt) and winning his girl back.\n\nIt wasn't terribly great, but it was enjoyable. He perfected his ability in this type of picture and was brilliant in The Thomas Crown Affair.",
