It's definitely a 9+ months age recommended. She started enjoying it around 9 months of age, and I know she enjoys it because she laughs and watches intently, and if you get in between her and the TV set while Baby Van Gogh is playing, she gets quite frustrated with you. I think she is definitely learning colors with the video. Since she started watching the video, she can now identify colors on the Sesame Street toy. When it says \"find the red drum\" she actually pushes the red drum. At 10 months old, I think that is pretty good. I think the Baby Einstein video taught her the colors, not the toy.",
