        "reviewBody": "RUNNING OUT OF TIME 2 is essentially a remake of the original, only this time Ekin Cheng steps into the role left by Andy Lau (whose character, supposedly, died at the end of the first). As Lau did, Cheng manuevers the same clever cop into his game. Also getting involved is Kelly Lin as a straight laced businesswoman whose important merger is threatened by the thief's games.\n\nNot as good as the original, as expected, but still clever. Although the whole cleverness does seem awfully familiar this time around.\n\n6 out of 10\n\n(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this movie or full-length reviews of other foreign films)",
