Hanzo is a tough cop who refuses to follow orders from his superiors. He is tough, he tortures HIMSELF to become even tougher. The actor is a bit pudgy with a double chin but his eyes - he is the real deal. Intense, a real bad ass. Another way he toughens himself up is to slam his own male member with a cane and then have sex with a huge burlap bag of rice (makes me think twice of ordering rice in a Japanese restaurant)- then when he needs to \"interrogate\" female suspects and/or witnesses - he uses his toughened flesh \"sword\" to get the women to comply. Strange, weird. The violence goes from clumsy to very real. My film group really liked it.",
