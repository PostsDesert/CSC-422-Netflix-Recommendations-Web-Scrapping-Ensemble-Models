Neither because of the slow development nor of the fair acting of Bullock/Connick Jr. The brilliant performance of Mae Whitman as Bernice made this whole movie worthwhile. I've never seen a child outperform her \"co-stars\" like that. She sure would deserve the Academy Award for best supporting actress. So if you want to see a slow love story with a very good child performance (German magazine \"cinema\" wrote: \"...she has the potential of Oscar winning Kathy Bates (\"Misery\")...\") this is yours. If you are a fan of high paced action movies, don't bother to see this, you wouldn't like it anyway.",
