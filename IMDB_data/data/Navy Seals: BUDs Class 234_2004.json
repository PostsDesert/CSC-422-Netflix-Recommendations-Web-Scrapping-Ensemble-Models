BUD/S is Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL, one of the most difficult training programmes in the US Military.\n\nOriginally produced for the Discovery Channel and released on DVD, this is a 3 disc set with 6 episodes (approx 45 min each, 2 per disc).\n\nIf you've ever wondered how SEALs become SEALs, this is the programme to watch. \n\nThis is real, unscripted, and raw. Men try and fail, try harder and succeed. Instructors, whilst mindful of the cameras, hold nothing back.\n\nThis series teaches us that It Pays to be a Winner!",
