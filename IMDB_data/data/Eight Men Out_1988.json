        "reviewBody": "This is one of the greatest sports stories ever told, the real story about how and WHY they fixed the World Series. Eliot Asinof's book should be read by anyone interested in history, and Sayles does an admirable job of tying it all together into a script (Sayles even cast Asinof in the movie, and then cast him again in Sunshine State.) It's a story that anyone interested in a history of America, a history of labor and management, a history of the greatest game will definitely enjoy. After reading it, the Shoeless Joe character from \"Field of Dreams\" suddenly has a resonance which that particular film could never explain (though it is nicely explained in the source for that film \"Shoeless Joe\") Also worth reading is \"The Glory of Their Times\" an oral history of early baseball.",
