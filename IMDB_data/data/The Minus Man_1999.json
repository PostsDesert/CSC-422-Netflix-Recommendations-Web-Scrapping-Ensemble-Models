        "reviewBody": "Hampton Fancher's The Minus Man is a methodical, chilling excursion into the mind of a serial killer. Not much different from the better known Henry: Portrait of a serial killer, this movie is not a comfortable motion picture to sit through. The lack of overt violence and gore deepens the sense of unease. Watching Vann's tale unfold, we should be gripped by revulsion; instead, there's a strange fascination. Like Henry this movie takes us into an alien world and strands us there for a little while by way of showing things from the killer's point of view. This movie may not invite emotional participation, but it gives its audience much to ponder."
