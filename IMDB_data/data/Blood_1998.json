        "reviewBody": "Blood is a serious movie. Very very serious. How can I tell that it's serious? The acting. Look how serious the actors are and the roles they are playing. Ooooooooo! And listen to the music. The middle eastern style chanting and the erotic sounds with hip hop beats. Very serious $#!+. Too bad the end result is so poorly executed that it actually made me laugh. The hilarity primarily points at the music because of how cliche it is and how hard it tries to convince you that this is a movie that should be taken seriously. It's vastly retarded. The movie is a little bloody but not gory and the action was okay. Also the pacing is sluggish and it is very drama driven and serious. I would consider this a \"bad good\" movie but don't take my word for it. It really is a dumb ass movie.",
