Not capable of getting her back by himself, Oz enlists the aid of Jimmy and wife Jill (Peet); she's anxious to get back into the game, but unfortunately Jimmy has put the old life behind him in favor of staying at home and obsessing over the cleanliness of his surroundings. The same cast that brought so much life and energy to The Whole Nine Yards flounders in this embarrassingly unfunny follow-up where the film's ridiculous story throws out one silly plot twist after another and an abundance of desperate gags. At times the actors appear as if they're begging for help. *"
