        "reviewBody": "I rented this movie with no prior knowledge of it. I simply saw Carly Pope in the cast list and thought, \"How fun. I remember her from 'Popular'.\" I thought this was going to be a funny movie, not a depressing flick about depressing people and their depressing lives. I love movies in which families get together for holidays or events (ie. 'Eulogy' or 'Home For The Holidays') and you witness their personal insanities and eccentricities. But I like them because they portray these families in a light that reminds us of our own relatives and allows us to remember that families are insane yet normal. This movie does not do that. It simply removes any faith you may have about commitment, fidelity, love or happiness. I am not a hopeless romantic or blind optimist, but the problems in these peoples' lives did not warrant the amount of infidelity and self-pity that was portrayed. The only characters I enjoyed were the mom, Carly Pope's caterer/bartender and Dylan (only for his quirkiness, his home-wrecker side really bothered me). Basically, this movie is not funny and would have more success if it presented itself as a drama.",
