        "reviewBody": "If you liked the book Emma by Jane Austen I do not think you will be disappointed with this dramatization. They did change a few things from the book but those who have not read the book will get most of the content. I particularly enjoyed the costumes. The gowns, hats and caps of the ladies were spectacular. The detail, even down to the ornate hat pins, helped make this a delight to watch. The characterizations were quite faithful for the most part. Mr.Woodhouse, while perhaps not quite the same as the book, was an interesting and quite funny character. This mini-series did a very good job of capturing a great deal of the humor of Jane Austen (she is incredibly funny!) which is not all that easy to translate from her elegant prose to the camera and dialog of video rendition. When I see something like this that is so well done it makes me appreciate anew this art form and especially that of script writing....not to mention blocking....editing.... I think the mini-series is friendlier to a good adaption of Jane Austen's novels rather than the movie. This is my favorite of those I have seen with the A & E 1996 version as a close 2nd and the 1996 movie as my least favorite. I have not seen 1948 & 1960 BBC versions - wonder where I can find them???",
