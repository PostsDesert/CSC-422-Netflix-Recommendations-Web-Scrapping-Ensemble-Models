Also what's with the last name Reddy (south Indian) and speaking Hindi with a northern accent at home? It should have been something like Singh or Kapoor. Little things like this mess up the story's authenticity. Someone should have caught that. The other contrived scene was the crooked Indian shopkeeper - I know they lack in good service, but not that bad! Unless they were calling attention by way of a parody. Overall it was a fun movie. Good job by the director/actors."
