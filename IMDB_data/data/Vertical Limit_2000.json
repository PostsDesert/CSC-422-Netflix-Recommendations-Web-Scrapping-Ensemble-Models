        "reviewBody": "Having climbed in the Andes, Tian Shan, St. Elias and other\n\nmountain ranges across the planet, I was often asked what I\n\nthought of this movie, and it's accuracy. \n\nThis is, without doubt, the least accurate film on climbing I have\n\never seen. This movie is simply absurd. I consider it about as\n\n\"accurate\" as, say, Spy Kids is to global espionage. \n\nIn addition to the gaffs pointed out, I wanted to state what was\n\nmost amusing to me: Inside the crevasse, the climbers ice tools\n\nbounce off the crevasse walls like they're made out of solid steel\n\n(and 'ping' just like it). But when Chris O'Donnall does his full\n\nsprint (at altitude!) and huge leap across a cavernous abyss, he\n\ndrives his ice tools into the other side - made of solid rock - and\n\nsticks like Spiderman. The film is filled with many other absurd\n\nimplausabilities that insult the sport it manipulates in the guise of\n\nentertainment. \n\nAside from that, as so many others have noted, the movie is\n\nsimple minded action. If you don't mind laughing at much of it, and\n\ndon't for a moment think it represents realistic climbing, leave your\n\nbrain at the door and you might have some fun. But most people\n\nwill just find it absurd rubbish.",
