I wish I could say more, but there's not much more to tell, except maybe the best friend mom has a nice round ass, thats it! Oh my god apparently a comment has to be at least 10 lines, so I'm filling this with nonsense. Meagon Good from You got served is so hot, oh my god thats too sick, why isn't she in this movie? So if you like urban movies I suggest: How High, You Got Served, Paid in full, Boys n the Hood, Menace 2 Society, New Jack City, Don't be a Menace, Belly, Cradle 2 the Grave, Friday etcetera. Way better and entertaining movies then this one!",
