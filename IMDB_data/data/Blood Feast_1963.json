        "reviewBody": "As the first-ever splatter epic, \"Blood Feast\" is assured of its place in history. This low-budget shlockfest is single-handedly responsible for launching an entire genre of films, including slasher fare like the Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm Street movies. For that reason, its place in hell is probably assured, too. Though to be fair, of course, we can thank it for so many other blood-soaked cinematic excursions that are actually entertaining.\n\nAnd fortunately for cheese heads, director Herschell Gordon Lewis, the \"Godfather of Gore,\" is also the Ed Wood of gore. The two great auteurs share many important trademarks in their roster of masterpieces, including wooden acting, absurdly bad dialogue, cheeseball effects, and lousy continuity. \"Blood Feast\" sports all of these endearing qualities and more, even going so far as to include some Woodian abrupt day-to-night-to-day transitions.\n\nThe dopey plot involves one Fuad Ramses, author of the New York Times bestseller \"Ancient Weird Religious Practices,\" and his attempt to re-create, through his ridiculous \"exotic catering\" service, an authentic Egyptian blood feast, whatever that is. But really, all we need to know is that it involves the gruesome murders of pretty young women. (Surprise, surprise, surprise!) Beyond that, all that's left to say is that the Good Doctor gives this landmark bit of trash cinema two wheels of gorgonzola up.\n\nFollowed, insanely, by a sequel in 2002.",
