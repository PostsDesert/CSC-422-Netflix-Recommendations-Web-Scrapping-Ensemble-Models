        "reviewBody": "i didn't like this film, i thought it was very disappointing. After the fun of passport to paris, i thought our lips are sealed would have a much better plot. However talking to the screen for the whole movie as though they were deciding (whilst making the movie) what should happen next was not cool. The film lacked any real depth, and the subplot about the girls trying to fit in was poorly executed. On a positive side the acting was better than some other olsen twin films, although until they move away from the fluffy movies of travelling around the world to meet boys (in the pretense of a more significant plotline), their movies remain stooped in the \"tween girl\" market."
