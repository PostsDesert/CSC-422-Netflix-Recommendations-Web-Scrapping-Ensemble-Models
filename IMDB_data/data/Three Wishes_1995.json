Especially appealing to me, as a senior, was the locale and the truly accurate portrayal of life and times in the late 1950's. Even the kitchen appliances and the dish ware were spot on! I lived in a tract just like the one in the film - the San Fernando Valley urban explosion! I thought the players were all fine and the child actors were very effective. The story dragged a bit but pacing is not everything - sometimes it is good to linger a bit and be nostalgic. This is a good movie for thoughtful teens who can appreciate the message given about home, hope and history."
