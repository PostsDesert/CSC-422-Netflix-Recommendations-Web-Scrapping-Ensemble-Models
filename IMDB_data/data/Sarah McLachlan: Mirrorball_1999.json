        "reviewBody": "Sarah McLachlan is in total control in Mirrorball. Everything you see and hear is there because she wanted it there. She appears on stage wearing a lavender evening gown topped by a black feather boa looking and sounding absolutely elegant. It took me a few minutes to realize she was also barefoot. Cute! Every song is a major piece of music, her performance way over the top, and the concert on dvd is probably even better than being there live. Sarah McLachlan has that rare talent of being able to visualize how her music sounds and looks to an audience and that talent sure shows in Mirrorball.",
