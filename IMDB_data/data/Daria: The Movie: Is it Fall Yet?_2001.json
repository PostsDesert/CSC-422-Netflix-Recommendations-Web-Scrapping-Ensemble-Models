Daria, Quinn, and Jane in particular must re-evaluate their lives and relationships. What they find is the true nature of themselves and those who touch their lives. Daria and Jane find the depth of their friendship. Daria adjusts to dating. And Quinn realizes the neglect of her mind and her true feelings. All this without getting sappy once! Oh yes, and it's really funny too. This is a four star flick that's not to be missed."
