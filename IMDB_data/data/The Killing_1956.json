The story just pops off the screen - and at less than 90 minutes, there's literally no filler. I love the winding time line (\"earlier that day\" etc.), which has been liberally utilized by Quentin Tarantino (Jackie Brown, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs). This film was made right before Kubrick's WWI marvel, Paths of Glory, and his genius is apparent in both. No wasted words or actions. Love that last line!"
