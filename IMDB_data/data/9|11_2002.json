I guess this here is the most popular documentary of that day but I just now got around to it. As usual, everything we see going on down there is still shocking and it still seems like it was just a bad dream. The noise of the bodies hitting the ground is a sound you won't get out of your head.\n\nThere have been countless documentaries done on 9/11 and I find all of them incredibly hard to watch and this one here is no different."
