I have since caught it in syndication, and I am surprised at how good it is. It does have its sappy moments (like even the greatest sitcoms -- except \"Seinfeld,\" which poked fun at this show at least once), but at the core of the show is an homage to all things Manhattan, and classic comedy heavily influenced by \"The Dick Van Dyke Show,\" \"I Love Lucy,\" and Sid Caesar. I have laughed out loud more to this show than I have to some of my other favorites.\n\nThe show does have its weaknesses and some annoying characters, but the comedy holds up anyway. If you have avoided this show until now, give it a try.",
