        "reviewBody": "Winnie the Pooh has always been a big part of my childhood, and I have a big soft spot for it now. And I still love Sing Along Songs: Sing a Song with Pooh and Piglet Too. The animation is a nice mix of the classic animation from The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh to the newer style of Piglet's Big Movie, and no matter whether it was 35 years ago or 10 throughout it is very colourful and elegant. The music is a delight, like the animation it is a mix of classic, with Heffalumps and Woozles and Wonderful Thing About Tiggers, and new, with Sing Ho For the Life of a Bear and With a Few Good Friends, and the cute melodies and droll lyrics again make for catchy, pleasant listening. Kangaroo Hop is also great fun. This Sing along also has a story, with Pooh on a search for his song. This story is very heartwarming and maintains the childhood innocence that is so lovable about Winnie the Pooh today. Right from cute Piglet to hilarious Tigger, the characters are engaging and voiced beautifully. And for anybody into DVD extras and like to be educated and entertained, look no further than Word Time, very cleverly constructed and wittily written. Overall, fantastic, one of the best Disney Sing alongs by far and still fresh even after watching it over and over. 10/10 Bethany Cox",
