        "reviewBody": "This is an excellent film, I am completely mystified and baffled by the low ratings it has received thus far.\n\nIt has solid characterizations, good acting, well written dialog, and a cohesive storyline that builds and brings quite a few surprises.\n\nThe only reason I gave it 9 stars rather than 10 is because -- how one of the characters met her demise is never really answered, nor why Anthony and Victoria have the sex problem that they have, but other than that, the film is very good.\n\nWe do get a hint as to what might be the problem when Anthony's boyhood pal, Michael and his wife, Sarah show up for an afternoon visit.\n\nThe visit consists of some racial bickering between Anthony's white wife, Victoria and Anthony's boyhood pal, Michael. Some revealing traits of the various characters are shown amidst a lot of drinking, and some extremely spicy romping in the hot tub.\n\nA neighbor calls complaining about too much noise, and the police show up at the door. Michael is the one to answer the door, and he becomes rather abrasive towards the cop.\n\nShortly after this encounter, someone is discovered drown in the hot tub, and the situation escalates.",
