It has all the traits of a bad vampire movie: cheap sets, bad special effects, and horrible acting, but somehow it became worse than the sum of its parts.\n\n The 'intro' sequence was great. I got totally excited by it, and maybe that contributed to my total let down over the rest of the movie. The script is so awful, my words can't do it justice. The 'score' does nothing but exacerbate the poor dialogue. The acting is of the worst caliber. I could go on and on about how bad this film is, but why bother.",
