        "reviewBody": "This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen quite a few. It was so bad that it is difficult to know where to begin. The writing was terrible containing very little plot. The acting was bad and not believable at all except maybe in the porn industry. the special effects were non-existent not even qualifying as hoaky. I didn't think it was funny at all and I am a huge fan of dark comedies. I cannot think of any other movie out there to compare it to because I haven't seen anything this poorly done. I am still surprised that this made it to DVD and someone was able to convince rental outlets to carry it. I would not even put this on public access as it would be insulting to other programs that are on there. No production value to speak of here and I looked really hard to try and find some redeeming quality. Some of the guys are cute, but that doesn't defend the rest of the movie. Please don't waste your time with this one.",
