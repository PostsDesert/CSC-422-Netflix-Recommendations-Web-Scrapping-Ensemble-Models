I usually find one disappointment or another in animated works today. Many times I have left my children watching the film and gone off to do work or watch something else in the bedroom, but the story and characters in this film had me watching the whole movie and ready to watch again since my children liked it so much they will want to watch it again today after school. Watching this film made me remember the fun I had reading Dragon Rides of Pern and many of the Dragon Lance novels. Now I simple MUST find a DVD of the first film in this series and wait for the third :(\n\nHats off to the makers of this film. I did not recognize any of the names, but I will certainly look to see if they have anymore titles out and if they are as great as this one is.",
