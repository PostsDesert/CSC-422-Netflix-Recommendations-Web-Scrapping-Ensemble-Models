Gladly i changed my mind and watched all the rest.\n\nIt's a shame cause all of the sequels were great for their standard and only part 1 is so poorly made that disappoints in every level.\n\nOnly don Wilson can't save this movie. The fights are bad and the story is so poorly made that is way below average even for these kind of b-movies.\n\nFortunately all the sequels faired a lot better and i suggest u skip this part and begin with part 2.\n\nAfter part 2 there is no plot continuity as don Wilson play different characters so u don't have problems with plot continuity.\n\nAll in all the bloodfist box set is great but not this movie.\n\nIf u like don Wilson also check out for the following gems in which he stars...\n\nBLACKBELT\n\nRING OF FIRE TRILOGY\n\nOUT FOR BLOOD\n\nMOVING TARGET\n\nBLOODFIST 2-8",
