        "reviewBody": "This movie draws you in then blows it providing plot complications of the \"Oh come on!\" variety. Someone as telegenic as Jason Behr would not need to write to a felon to find a shoulder to cry on. All he has to do is open his front door and select from the crowd waiting there to do him. Any one of them would put up with any amount of whining he needs to do.\n\nI was in a writing class once and we were asked to write a story called \"The Father.\" That was the only requirement. 12 out of 13 people handed in a story that ended with a father-son hug and the exchange: \"I love you son...\" \"I love you dad.\" Ugh! It's a scene that facile minds find endlessly satisfying but it's very, very lame. Perhaps this movie gets filmed over and over again because emerging gay teens require their generations hottie in the role of the gay son.\n\nI've never called my brother \"Bro.\" Does anybody?"
