Unfortunately, how the viewer perceives the results is not in my control--even the subjects as viewer may misconstrue my purpose.\n\nThis film explores those options and, interestingly, leaves it to the audience to decide on the evidence presented. Shelby Lee Adams presents his case well as the photographer, but it is clear that the subjects of his pictures are not aware of the subtler influences of outside society on the content of the pictures.\n\nIn all, a great film to watch if you're interested in perceptions.",
