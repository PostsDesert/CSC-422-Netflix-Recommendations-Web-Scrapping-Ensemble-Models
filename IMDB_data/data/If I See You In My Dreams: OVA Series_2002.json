        "reviewBody": "Masuo Fuguno, a 24-year-old adult who works as a salaryman in the metropolis of Tokyo, has never had a girlfriend in his life, and hasn't even kissed or held hands with any female. This is partly because he is unlucky in love, and partly because he sometimes acts in a clumsy or thick-headed manner that gets him into trouble. Nevertheless, he has a sweet and gentle demeanor that makes him popular among women, but not enough to make them go out with him. Then one day, his world turns upside down with the appearance of Nagisa Shiozaki, a pretty brunette kindergarten teacher who agrees to go on a date with him. It's love at first sight for Masuo, but whenever he tries to make serious progress his bad luck kicks in and leaves him in situations that Nagisa easily misconstrues. That's not the only problem: Nagisa, while she likes Masuo, constantly pushes him away due to a previous affair which ended badly, and she can't risk another affair and heartbreak. And though Masuo doesn't believe it, his friend and co-worker, a stunning blonde named Miho Hamaoka, has fallen in love with him and constantly makes advances toward him. Between perpetual bad luck and a choice between two girls, what will become of Masuo?\n\nThe whole story is just pretty much one of those love at first sight style stories with not exactly a lot of appeal to it.\n\nThough it does have a good ost and it's art is really good, much better then what the show deserves.",
