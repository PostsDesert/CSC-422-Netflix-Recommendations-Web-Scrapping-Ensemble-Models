The script is hilarious. The editing is seamless. Every line is quote-worthy. The acting is spot-on. Michael Keaton is at the top of his game, Terry Garr is a comic genius, and the casting is perfect. \n\nThe story is both goofy, and rather deep. It conatins at least a dozen of my top 100 all-time favorite movie 'moments'. Its the kind of film you see late at night on TV, and you start watching a few minutes, then suddenly before you know it, you've watched the whole thing AGAIN. Obviously, I highly recommend this film, and encourage more filmmakers to study it, because they just don't make 'em like this anymore."
