It doesn't take long for the pair to discern that something's seriously wrong in Pleasantville.\n\nThe residents seem to have no self-control as they frolic, fight, shag, and generally misbehave. Jennifer's brother (Bill Paxton) develops a creepy attitude problem. Even the town doctor (Hume Cronyn) has become a menace!\n\nCan Jen and Stu uncover what's going on before succumbing to the madness themselves?\n\nIMPULSE is a solid sci-fi thriller with a host of interesting characters exhibiting bizarre behaviors. Ms. Tilly and Mr. Matheson are very good in their bewildered, sleuthing roles.\n\nBe sure to watch this to the end for a wicked surprise!..."
