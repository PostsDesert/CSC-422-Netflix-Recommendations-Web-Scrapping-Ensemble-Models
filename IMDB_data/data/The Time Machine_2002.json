Wells book, but in my opinion, that does not detract from the movie. I thought the Orlando Jones character of Vox was quite interesting and amusing, and Jeremy Irons definitely deserved more screentime, as he is a superb actor in every role he takes on. The character development was a little weak, but it was tricky with the time travel aspect. I found the special effects to be good; it is difficult to measure up to some of the special effects that have come out recently, and I think they did a good job. With every new movie that comes out, you have increasingly more spectacular visual effects, especially with the higher budget films. All in all, I think that the actors did a good job, and the movie kept me interested the whole time and was especially good in some parts. I would definitely recommend this movie, and I give it 8 stars."
