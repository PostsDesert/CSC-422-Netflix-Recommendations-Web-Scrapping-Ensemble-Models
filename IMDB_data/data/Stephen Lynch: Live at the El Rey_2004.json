Some of the extras are a bit boring or maybe i just watched them too soon after watching the actual show, i'm not sure.\n\nThis is one of those things I wish I could have seen live, I have seen Lynch live and he is the best live show (as far as comedic) I have seen. If you find this DVD anywhere....pick it up, buy it, steal it, or trade a family member for it. If you don't see it, look online.",
