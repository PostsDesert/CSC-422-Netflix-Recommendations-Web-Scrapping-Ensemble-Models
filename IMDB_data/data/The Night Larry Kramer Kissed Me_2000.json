But sadly, director Tim Kirkman was unable to find the cinematic equivalent of the intimacy of this one-man show. I was all too aware of his jerking camera work throughout the film; it was almost as if he was someone's kid brother trying to call attention to himself...When directing a piece that is focused on an individual; it isn't a good idea to attempt to bring in some flashy camera work. This is unfair to the audience and the actor/author. I wish some one had just done a straightforward documentation on video...Unfortunately; this may be all future generations have as a record of a trailblazing one-man show.",
