        "reviewBody": "In my book, this is one of the overlooked action classics of the 1990's. With solid production values and a top notch cast, and set against a sunny and seedy Los Angeles backdrop, this fast-paced story of desperate criminals driven by greed and revenge is the perfect vehicle for \"Guy's Movie Night.\"\n\n Harvey Keitel is at his best as Roy Egan, the hardened career criminal bent on avenging a double-cross by former partner-in-crime, Skip Kovich (played by Stephen Dorff, in his best performance ever). Also along for the ride are Timothy Hutton, the late Wade Dominguez (\"Dangerous Minds\"), and a very sexy Famke Janssen. As if this weren't enough, this movie is notable for providing the only film nude scenes of Lucy Liu (a brief role as Dorff's stripper ex-girlfriend), and Dana Barron (Audry Griswold in the original \"Vacation\").\n\nDespite its occasional plot holes, this film gets better with repeated viewings. And for fans of what my Manly Man Movie Night associates have deemed \"Keiteling\" (the mandatory Harvey Keitel emotional and physical meltdown, e.g. the church scene in \"Bad Lieutenant\") it doesn't get any better than this. However, the film is quite violent, and I have not met many women who like it. Still, \"City of Industry\" belongs in the collection of any fan of revenge-based action thrillers.",
