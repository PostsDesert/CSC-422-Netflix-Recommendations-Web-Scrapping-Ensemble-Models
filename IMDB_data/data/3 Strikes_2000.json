However, if you are one of the tight assed people who think you should take this movie serious like you are about to watch \"Gone with the Wind\" you are sadly mistaken. Faizon Love and David Alan Grier are great. Particularly David Alan Grier's \"look out he's got a gun\" line. It is a very low budget comedy by a first time director. Also the great newscaster Jerry Dunphy has a cameo.",
