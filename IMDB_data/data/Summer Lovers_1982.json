        "reviewBody": "Okay, okay. It's a thin plot with a lot of Chamber of Commerce scenery. But it took me back to Greece as I had seen it. Santorini is unmatched anywhere. (Mykonos is also very beuatiful.) The beaches have more than their share of full-tan bathers. It's real. It's their culture. So what? It's not a reason to dish the movie. The movie brings in top musical productions of the era and three budding stars. In the \"Isn't it Interesting Category\" it's notable that Daryl Hannah (Cathy) states that her fantasy \"is to be a mermaid.\" Voila! The mermaid she became vaulted her career forward. The biggest disappontment that I got from the movie is finding out that the beautiful Valerie Quennessen died in an auto accident in 1989. She played the European free-spirit role well. She had stunning eyes - mindful of Princess Di. God bless her!"
