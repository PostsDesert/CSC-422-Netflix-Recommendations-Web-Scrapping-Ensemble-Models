        "reviewBody": "A very tight film with excellent performances from Anthony Wong and Jordan Chan. Solid performances from Chapman To, who was not as annoying as usual and Patrick Tse, who just oozed slime. Wong stars as a police man who kills a criminal(the talented Francis Ng) and an undercover cop(the charismatic Lau Ching-wan). The sons (Chan and Raymond Wong) of the dead men both want revenge. Raymond Wong joins the police force and is eventually put on Anthony Wong's team. He gets to know this man who \"murdered\" his father by watching him try to catch a Vietnam gang member and by watching him take care of his father, the victim of a stroke. With a few predictable and unpredictable twists, the film reaches a very satisfying conclusion. The only problem, and it's a big one, is the annoying soundtrack. A fine bit of music used while the police investigate a gruesome murder scene is totally inappropriate when the sons are visiting the graves of their fathers.",
