        "reviewBody": "I like watching a movie without expectations, but this love-comedy was well worth the time. I watched this movie only because it had Reese Witherspoon in in, who I am becoming more and more impressed with, particularly in comedies. She steals the scenes in this movie, and is the catalyst for all that happens. It is a surprisingly funny and good movie. Reminds me of Blood Simple (for all the weird things that keep happening) and Planes, Trains, and Automobiles (for all the weird things that keep happening). Not a well orchestrated movie, because things are somewhat disjointed (she takes him to the airport, but drops him off at the downtown convention center (reality mistake) and no reason for the cops to be there as they attempt to leave the restaurant after not paying (movie mistake)), but the acting is good and when the writing is right, it is very good.",
