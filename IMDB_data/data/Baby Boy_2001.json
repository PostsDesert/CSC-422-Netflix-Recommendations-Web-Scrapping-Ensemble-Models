I was very glad I did.\n\nIt's basically a scaled-down version of Boyz in the Hood, with fewer characters allowing for more development. While it's not quite on the same level as Boyz, it's a very emotional drama that's thought provoking, sad, hilariously funny, and at times subtly disturbing.\n\nAfter this, Boyz, and Shaft, I am anxiously awaiting John Singleton's next work."
