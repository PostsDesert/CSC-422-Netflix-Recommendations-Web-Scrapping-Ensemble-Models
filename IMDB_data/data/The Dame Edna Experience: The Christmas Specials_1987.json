DE was so very current, so this is a snapshot of certain age. The only reason for not giving it a 10, is because of my personal lack of knowledge of British references throughout the show.\n\nAlways surprises, always on target, always multiple steps ahead of the audience and guests. \n\nPrior to this show, I only \"heard\" about Madge Alsop, so it was a delight to finally see her in the flesh.\n\nI was so thrilled to see her DVD available, that I bought it without any information of what to expect.\n\nThat she managed to get some guests of great renown is simply a tribute to DE! Hold your gladdies high, and enjoy possums everywhere! ..Zoe \n\nPS for those of you who are too caught up with who she is, please do yourself a favor and suspend belief for a while, let go and laugh!",
