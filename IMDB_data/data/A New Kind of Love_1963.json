        "reviewBody": "1963 lay somewhere between Ozzie and Harriet and Janice Joplin and this movie was raunchy \"adult fare\" for the time but sanitized. The characters couldn't say \"virgin\" but did say \"maiden\", couldn't even say \"prostitute\" but could say it in French (\"fille de joie\" or something). If you can imagine Paul Newman as a rakish cad who writes Beaudelaire verses on the bare bottoms of his nightly conquests and his real-life partner Joanne Woodward as a dike dress-designer turned tender hearted and vulnerable real woman posing as a prostitute after praying to St. Catherine, then you have a greater (much) ability to suspend disbelief than I do. Badly miscast leads, especially Woodward, despite one sexy scene in a teddy at the end. Otherwise, enjoy Paris, enjoy 60's color, and 60's sophistication and pretend that you are sneaking a look at the naughty movie that your parents wouldn't want you to see."
