        "reviewBody": "Centering around a fresh out of college couple, this story of two young lovers begins with how they met at school, moved in together, and all the happenings before, during and after.\n\nWith Martin Henderson leading and narrating the film, you see generally only his perspective of the story. Piper Perabo, plays his girlfriend, and true love. Although the film can be a bit slow at times, and a little silly...it does have some very funny situations and moments.\n\nI enjoyed it, and will probably see it in the future as well. It's not the best film out there, but for the budget they probably filmed it with, and the locations and actors, it's really not bad at all.\n\nA light romantic comedy, which is probably best suited for either a lonely Friday night at home, or a good date movie.",
