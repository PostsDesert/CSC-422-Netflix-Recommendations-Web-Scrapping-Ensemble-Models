        "reviewBody": "Geobreeders is about a team of Security specialists whose job is to rid Japan of \"Phantom Cats\", which are cats who have the capability of transforming into humans as well as manipulating computer hardware and software. The team use a special form of talisman to capture the cats and then store the cats on data disks. One of the key elements, is that while a recovery mission of some of the talismans is taking place, a raid on Kagura Total Securities (The name of the firm), occurs which completely destroys their office. During this raid, a Phantom Cat who'd changed sides and was assisting the Team, was kidnapped by the raiders, who turn out to be US Marines.\n\nIt is now up to the members of Kagura Total Securities to find their ally and friend. However, the team isn't willing to go out on a mission unless their is sufficient funding for the raid. So Yotishi volunteers to have the application fee taken out of his salary, not realising that the application fee is equal to One and a half years worth of his salary. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves Action Anime, as well as those with a thing against cats.",
