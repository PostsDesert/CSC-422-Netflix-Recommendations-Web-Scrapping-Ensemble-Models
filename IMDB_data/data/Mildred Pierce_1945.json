        "reviewBody": "Joan Crawford plays the title role, a mother who will do anything for her selfish daughter Veda, played by Ann Blyth. Mildred even goes into business, becoming a successful restaurant owner, but Veda is still ungrateful even as her mother has provided her opportunities in society.\n\nJack Carson plays Wally Fay, a man Mildred manipulates; Zachary Scott is Monte Beragon, another who gets involved in a tragic love triangle of sorts with Crawford's and Blyth's characters. Eve Arden plays Ida Corwin, a friend of Mildred's who later becomes one of her employees, that gets to say some great sassy lines including \"Personally, Veda's convinced me that alligators have the right idea. They eat their young.\"\n\nEventually, the daughter gets herself in deep trouble and the mother's sacrifice is made even greater. Directed by Michael Curtiz, and based on the James M. Cain novel with a screenplay by Ranald MacDougall, this essential drama also features Bruce Bennett, Lee Patrick, Veda Ann Borg, and Butterfly McQueen (uncredited).\n\nJoan Crawford's Academy Award winning Best Actress performance on her first (!) of three nominations. Also Supporting Actress Oscar nominations for Arden (her only!) and Blyth (her only as well). The film, its B&W Cinematography, and MacDougall's (his only) screenplay were also nominated. Added to the National Film Registry in 1996.",
