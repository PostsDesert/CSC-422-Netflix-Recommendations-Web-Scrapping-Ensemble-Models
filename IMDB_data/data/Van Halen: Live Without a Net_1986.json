        "reviewBody": "I actually was at this concert when they filmed the video. I attended the concert on the second night of a two night stand. The concert was pretty much like what is seen on the video with the exception that quite a few songs were left out. What was not seen on the video that we saw in person was the band playing \"You Really Got Me\",\"Good Enough\", and \"Wild Thing\". But probably the best part of the show that was not seen on the video was Van Halen playing their big hit at the time...\"Dreams\". During this song, Edward Van Halen was playing the keyboards with the guitar slung over his shoulder, and when it was time to play the mid-song solo, he whipped the Kramer around into his hands and cranked out a massive solo. I was amazed that this part was not shown on the video. Despite the stuff left out, this concert video is a good documentation of an early Hagar era VH show. The filming could have been a bit better, as could the sound, but I think the old New Haven Arena was to blame for that part.",
