What I liked best about the film was Tsurugi's in-it-for-the-money attitude. Aside from maybe Ratnose (did anyone else detect the slightest hint of sexual tension between Rat & Terry, or am I crazy?), Tsurugi cares about no one. He is, after all, \"a number one man!\" I know this bad anti-hero thing has been done to death, but Sonny Chiba is the best at what he does: whuppin' ass & lookin' cool.\n\nThe thing I didn't care too much for was Tsurugi's seeming ability to teleport wherever he needed to go. (Hong Kong! Tokyo! Jupiter!) Other than that minor inconsistency (remember, inconsistency is what makes a movie good, sometimes) I enjoyed this movie."
