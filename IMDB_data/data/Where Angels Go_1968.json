        "reviewBody": "This is another of those cases when I have seen the sequel before I saw the original, and from what I have seen this is another in those rare cases in which the sequel is better than the original. This film worked for me on two levels. On one level it was a pretty decent story about Marvel Ann (who was more of a peripheral character in the original) and how she tries to cope with her feelings about being a sort of ugly duckling. This is especially true in her scenes with her more attractive best friend Rosabelle (played by a very young Susan Saint James in her pre-\"MacMillan and Wife\" days). Also, the other main story that this film covers is the relationship between Reverend Mother (again played by Rosalind Russell) and Sister George (played by Stella Stevens). The relationship between those two is a reflection of what was going on in the Catholic church during the mid to late 1960's as this film came out a few years after Vatican II. Reverend Mother represents the old church and Sister George represents the younger face of Catholicism that is trying to change with the times. This is a wonderful film that really works as both a comedy and a drama."
