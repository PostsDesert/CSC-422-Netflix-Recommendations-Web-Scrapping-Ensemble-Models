        "reviewBody": "You either DEEPLY LOVE Sade or you're dead inside. I love Sade and her band for what they are Not, almost as much for what they create. They are not shallow, silly trend whores. They are original, subtle, sincere artists and performers that love their craft and really know their strengths. The vibe, the mood, the tone - whatever word you chose - rules their art. If you are aware of the bigger issues and conditions facing our planet then their approach and execution is beyond excellent, deepening my own feelings of sorrowful regret, growing dread, and fragile hope. The Billy Holiday and Janice Joplin imitators and posers can learn worlds from Sade and her alleged limitations. She is extremely gorgeous and elegant, and I would describe her music the same. I saw a live show in Washington, DC in 2001 and, as a musician, was awed at the band's talent and sound, which surpassed their excellently produced CDs. This DVD is a fantastic sample of that experience, even though it's from 1993. There is a newer live DVD of the 2001 tour and it's great, too.",
