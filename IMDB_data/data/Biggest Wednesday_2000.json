        "reviewBody": "Never in the history of surfing has the ocean roared as hard and as full-on as Wednesday the 28th of January 1998. The coast guard called out a warning advisory calling for a Condition Black otherwise known \"get the heck out of there.\" Shot with the technological innovations brought by IMAX, this provides some stunning birds eye view shots of a wave traveling to where it breaks.\n\nBiggest Wednesday was shot at two locations. On Maui, Laird Hamilton, Dave Kalama and Buzzy Kerbox took on the biggest day ever filmed at Jaws, their home big-wave break. Meanwhile on Oahu's North Shore, Ross Clarke-Jones, Tony Ray, Cheyne Horan, Ken Bradshaw, Shawn Briley, and Noah Johnson rode the biggest waves in the history of surfing at outside Log Cabins.\n\nCondition Black is definitely worth watching if you are a big wave lover. However on par to other big wave films I would say it gets the least attention and for what reason, I don't know why.\n\nMy rating for it as far as for surf films go.. i would give it about a 7 out of 10.",
