        "reviewBody": "I gave Dawn of the Dead a rewatch recently for a few reasons.\n\n1) 2020 blows and I can't handle anymore bad news or negativity so I watch a bunch of movies to avoid the news.\n\n2) it's been years since I watched it 3) I'll say it proudly, I'm a Snyder fan. I think he's a brilliant director.\n\n So I decided to buy this movie because it was cheap on Black Friday. A few things really stood out to me during the rewatch. It starts out with a bang to hook you in, and then gives you some unexpected character development in a unique setting. The cast doesn't really have a \"star\" but it's a solid and diverse crew. It was also really weird to see Phil Dunphy (TY Burrell) from Modern Family playing a cocky jerk, but he played it well. On top of all that, the zombies in this movie are awesome.\n\nI also found it cool that James Gunn wrote the screenplay.\n\nAlso, good news for zombie fans, Snyder has another zombie flick coming out in 2021 on Netflix, called Army Of The Dead. Most people believe this is not a sequel to Dawn of the Dead and probably just a stand alone story. Dave Bautista and Omari Hardwick will star in it.\n\nThanks for reading.",
