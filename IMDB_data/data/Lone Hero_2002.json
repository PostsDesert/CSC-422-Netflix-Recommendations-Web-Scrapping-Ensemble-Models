        "reviewBody": "Like most here, I stumbled across this movie by accident and am glad I did.\n\nRobert Forester is great, and Sean Patrick Flannery does a good job as the \"Lone Hero,\" but for me Lou Diamond Phillips stole the show.\n\nHis portrayal of a bad guy was anything but routine. His character is complex as a truly bad \"bad guy\" bordering almost on the unbelievable. A real cold-blooded killer with no compunction at all in killing people-cops or anyone else he chooses, he also possesses a genuine sardonic sense of the world he lives in. He bring an edge of humor into what could have been a run-of-the-mill murderer.\n\nThe humorous overtones carry through his every action and are reflected in his continued attempt to gain empathy from Flannery's character. One could almost say he is playing Satan. He enjoys his evil life style and tries over and over again to corrupt Flannery.\n\nI suspect Lou Diamond Phillips enjoyed this roll and was allowed by the director to shape the character himself.\n\nHis evil is an attractive evil and yet you know that if Flannery let's up or goes along with Phllips, Phillips' character would kill him in a second.\n\nI really enjoyed this movie.\n\nOh yeah, and the gun play/Western style shoot-em-up tone of the movie makes this one a keeper. Recommended.",
