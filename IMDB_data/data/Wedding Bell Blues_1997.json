        "reviewBody": "Jasmine (Illeana Douglas), Tanya (Paulina Porizkova), and Micki (Julie Warner) are apartment mates. Micki is about to be married, Tanya discovers she is pregnant by her long-standing boyfriend and Jasmine has a endless queue of men in and out of her bedroom. When Micki is suddenly jilted and Tanya's boyfriend does not pop the question, the three women decide to head to Las Vegas in search of men who will marry them...TODAY! Some of the choices include cowboys, stiff engineers and rich uglies. It seems like a bad idea, but, hey, stranger things have happened, right?\n\nThis is most likely a movie the male gender would deem a chick flick. The three ladies are all very beautiful and successful, so it's hard to imagine they are striking out in the love zone. However, Douglas, Warner, and Porizkova are total delights in their assigned roles. The lesser characters, including John Corbett, are also very well chosen. Las Vegas is a tinseltown of misspent dollars and does not offer much in the way of scenery. To make up for this, the costumes are lovely. Do you love movies that offer lots of smooching and giggles? Break out of the blues and locate this film before the week's end.",
