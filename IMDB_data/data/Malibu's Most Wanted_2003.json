        "reviewBody": "Being a huge fan of `The Jamie Kennedy Experiment,' I eagerly awaited the release of `Malibu's Most Wanted,' a big-screen, feature-length version of one of Jamie's character skits. Often described as a `Candid Camera' meets `Saturday Night Live' type of show, Jamie dons make-up and disguises in effort to pull pranks on trusting people. I have always considered his white rapper character, Brad Gluckman, to be one of my favorites, and always felt he didn't portray Brad, or `B-Rad,' nearly enough as he should.\n\nI was very pleased with how the movie turned out. It was a refreshing escape from the all-too-common war movies and horror-dramas of late. You can't help but feel for the confused white rapper who thinks his rhymes are 'the shiznit' and that he's just as 'down' as anyone else he may encounter on the other side of the tracks.\n\nIf I could give it stars, I'd give it five out of 5. On a scale from one to ten, with ten being best, I'd give it a 10. Two very enthusiastic thumbs up.\n\nGo see \"Malibu's Most Wanted\" if you're in the mood for a light-hearted, authentic comedy.\n\nAnd to all of those who haven't accepted \"Malibu's Most Wanted\" as an awesome movie... Don't be hatin'!"
