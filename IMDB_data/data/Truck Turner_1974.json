His woman, Nichelle Nichols, who runs a stable of prostitutes, offers half her take to whoever kills Hayes.\n\nIt's a decent if unexceptional blaxploitation flick, with its strength being performers like Yaphet Kotto -- he was going through a divorce at the time and needed the cash -- and Scatman Crothers, as well as Hayes doing the film score. To someone who doesn't know, it may sound like typical chik-a-boom music that infested every cop show and movie in the era, but there's a flair and drive to it that lifts it out of the ordinary.",
