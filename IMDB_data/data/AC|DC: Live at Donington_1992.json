        "reviewBody": "AC/DC: Live at Donington (1992) \n\n*** 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nHard rocking concert from AC/DC features all their hits as twenty-six cameras pick up all the action in 35mm. This group has released countless concerts over the years and even the bootleg market has quite a bit of footage out there but I think anyone would be hard pressed to find a better show than this. The original release and current DVD/CD contain a great mix and some wonderful visuals that put the viewer right in the center of the concert. Angus Young steals the show with his frantic guitar playing proving that he's one of the most underrated out there. Brian Johnson's lead vocals are incredibly strong and among the best work in his career. The highlights for me are the underrated \"Money Talks\" and a really hard hitting \"You Shook Me All Night Long\". The standard classics like \"Back in Black\", \"Highway to Hell\" and \"For Those About to Rock\" also sound terrific. AC/DC fans are certainly going to eat this up but even non-fans will probably enjoy it as long as they're into classic rock."
