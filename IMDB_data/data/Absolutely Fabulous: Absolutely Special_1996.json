The duo of Patsy and Edina were a creation of pure genius, the wilder they got, the funnier.\n\nLaughs galore, the whole series is littered with classic episodes, my favourites being France and Happy New Year, the one liners in each are perfection.\n\nI've always thought the cast had as much fun making it as we had watching it, there always appeared to be a real closeness there.\n\nWill we ever get the likes of this again, not sure, but I hope so.\n\nComedy gold. 10/10",
