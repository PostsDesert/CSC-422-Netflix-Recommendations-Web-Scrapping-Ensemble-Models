Rupert Everett is perfect key for tale, Julia Roberts is perfect choice for ex girl friend but the axis, the top and the heart of film is Cameron Diaz in one of her best roles. it is a good film because it is excellent puzzle. love, hate, humor, vulnerability, the bitch, the innocent young woman, the naive lover and slices of meetings are directed with precise and full of grace art. so, it is a comedy and little more. picture of choices and shadows of past, subtle nuances of dialogs and a wise cast are central pieces of a build in which all is basket of crumbs from a hided Shakespeare."
