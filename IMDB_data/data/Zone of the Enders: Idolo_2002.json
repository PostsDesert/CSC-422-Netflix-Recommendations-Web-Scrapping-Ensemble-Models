The Idolo mecha reminded me a whole lot of Evangelion. But overall they weren't too blatant.\n\nThe voice acting was pretty good. The dialogue at spots was a bit odd, but you can never nail dialogue perfectly. The story was beautifully drawn and written, yet I felt the backstory wasn't very well set up. Granted, I've not played the Zone of Enders game or seen anything else on this series, I'd like to know more.\n\n6.5 out of 10",
