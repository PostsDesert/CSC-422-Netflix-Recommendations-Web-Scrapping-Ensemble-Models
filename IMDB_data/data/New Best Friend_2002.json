I mean this was released direct to home video, so that should say something right out of the video store. This movie is what it is, a simple mystery movie, a simple click movie about taking in a nobody and making her a somebody and then regretting your decision when it comes back to haunt you. Towards the end I really felt sad for Hadley (Meredith Monroe) and could totally see why she did what she did. She built her lab partner, with good intentions mind you, from nothing into a resultant someone, and watched basically as she took her life away from her, all not meaning to do so....\n\nNow would this movie have made it in the theaters? No, I don't think so. But considering the usual quality of movies that go directly to video, this is one of the better ones.\n\nBello",
