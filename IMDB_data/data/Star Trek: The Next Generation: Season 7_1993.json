        "reviewBody": "A friend of mine purchased this game for $0.99 off of e-bay (plus 8 bucks shipping). A deal this good is a rarity to be sure. Essentially the game gives you a taste of what it would be like to be aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise during a time of great struggle and chaos. Well kind of... the real fun of this Video/Board game comes in the members of your crew who you compete with/against. If you watch movies/play games to avoid any real interaction with your friends, this is not the game for you. However, if you appreciate low-budget fun and laughing at stupid Klingons as they give you nicknames and tell you to \"Experience Bij!\" then this is the game for you. The only downside is that after enough playing you can adjust strategy based on your knowledge of the movie. If this were redone on DVDs the possibilities would be endless.\n\nI give this a high rating due primarily to the high quality of people I have participated with in this game, as well as the numerous times I have found it appropriate to yell \"Experience Bij\" at someone. The ending sequence is also pretty excellent, but I don't want to give too much away. The game does get pretty intense as your time runs out, so to any thrill seekers out there, try eating your snacks during the first 15 minutes of the mission to really give yourselves the feeling of what it's like to be a on the U.S.S. Enterprise.",
