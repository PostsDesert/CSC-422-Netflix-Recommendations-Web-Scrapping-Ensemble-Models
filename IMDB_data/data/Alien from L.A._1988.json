        "reviewBody": "Campy spoof combining elements of 'Journey to the Center of the Earth,' 'Indiana Jones,' exploitation B-movies of the 60's, and apocalyptic science fiction movies of the 80's. Kathy Ireland is so bizarre in the role of an explorer following in the footsteps of her famous father (as in 'Journey to the Center of the Earth' no less) it's like watching a car accident. You just have to watch though you know it's wrong...oh so wrong. (Apparently popular enough to warrant a sequel that actual takes the title of Jules Verne's classic, \"Journey to the Center of the Earth.\" There are many versions with that title but only one features a cameo return by Kathy Ireland.) \"Alien from L.A.\" is what they used to refer to as \"Saturday afternoon matinee\" or \"popcorn movie\" and is better than the sequel only because when \"Alien\" runs out of steam they strip Kathy down to a bikini top to finish out the movie. Nice trick. Worked for me."
