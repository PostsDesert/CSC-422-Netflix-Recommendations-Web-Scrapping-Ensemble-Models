In a rare case of voice-over working The Breakfast Club delivers on its intended purpose of addressing alienation, relating and drama at the teenage level, but the fun and comedy is never too far out from the picture. Of the two girls Claire is the pretty one and no wonder she gets upskirted. And of course women being women the bad boy gets her to be his. 7/10.",
