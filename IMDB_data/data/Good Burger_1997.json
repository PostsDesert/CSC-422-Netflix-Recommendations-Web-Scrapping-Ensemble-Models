        "reviewBody": "I am not really in the target audience for GOOD BURGER since it's a movie made by Nickelodeon. However, I wanted to try it since it has some sort of guilty pleasure cult, and it was just ok.\n\nEd is the cashier of Good Burger, and he is so loyal to his job to the point of showering with his suit on. After arriving on time, he and his colleagues find out that Mondo Burger (the fast food on the other side of the street) is in competition with them because they produce better burgers. After some attempts by Mondo Burger for stealing their sauce all failed, Good Burger's most loyal workers Ed and Dexter (Kel Mitchell and Kenan Thompson) tries to find out why their hamburgers are huge. And you might guess where all this is going.\n\nWhile at times it was a bit dull paced, it had some funny moments here and there and some nice celebrity cameos. Kel and Kenan were worth a few laughs from time to time and veteran Abe Vigoda was the perfect scene stealer. Not a film to be taken seriously, just a time passer if you want to kill an hour and a half without thinking too much.",
