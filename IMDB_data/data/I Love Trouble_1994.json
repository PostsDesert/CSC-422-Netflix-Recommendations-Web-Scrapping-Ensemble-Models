        "reviewBody": "Well, I wouldn't exactly describe this as a timeless classic, a thought provoking movie, or one of the legendary love stories of the silver screen. Still, it's a fun romance and an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.\n\nThe tale revolves around two rival Chicago reporters, one relatively novice, Sabrina Peterson, the other the more seasoned, well known Peter Brackett, who are both hot on the trail of a train derailment story. Of course competition between them is intense (and so at times is the chemistry) as the two exchange false leads, fibs, barbs, and witty repartee. Lots of predictable action, chases, and mystery as to the identity of the bad guys.\n\nThe lovely, always endearing Julia Roberts plays the journalistic sharp cookie, Sabrina, with Nick Nolte convincing in the role of her rival, Brackett. At least the pair are not hopping into bed within the first half hour (in refreshing contrast to most modern films), leaving a little time for storytelling and character development.\n\nThis is definitely describable as a \"flick\" (for guys or chicks); its spirit is in keeping with its title. Personally, I'm a great Julia Roberts fan. This isn't her best picture but, nevertheless, it's quite watchable.",
