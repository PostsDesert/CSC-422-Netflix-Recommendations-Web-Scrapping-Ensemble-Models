        "reviewBody": "In 1858 France, Bernadette (Jennifer Jones), an adolescent peasant girl, has a vision of \"a beautiful lady\" in the city dump. She never claims it to be anything other than this, but the townspeople all assume it to be the virgin Mary.\n\nI suspect religious folks and non-religious folks might get two different things out of this film. From a religious point of view, there is definitely a theme of religion versus the state, and how you have to be firm in your beliefs when the state comes to challenge you. Even if threatened, stay strong.\n\nNow, I am not religious, but I think a more general theme can be taken from this. And that is to believe in yourself when others doubt you or call you stupid. It may be easy to believe in yourself when the Mother of God is telling you to do things, but it need not be so dramatic.\n\nOh, and Vincent Price is in the movie. So that automatically makes it worth watching.",
