        "reviewBody": "great movie. don't be a snob. In the tradition of PORKY'S , SAINT JACK and THE KILLERS. Expect one surprise after another. Does the name Kris Kristoferson mean anything to you? Lingers in the mind. Lensing is superior. Hal Hartley minus the pretentiousness. I saw this film in my living room with a blind date , she laughed so hard the contents of her Mohito was shooting out of her nose. Luther is like the Sean Gullette of the rap community. Really the movie's subversive , below the surface ,message is not about Florida or beach parties at all. It is , I believe , a deep satire masked as a summer comedy jam. Like the old Freeman Alley days in Hollywood , when you couldn't say things out loud. you had to bury the message. Peirce the surface and dig the social commentary. Peel slowly and see. The chicks in it are pretty hot too."
