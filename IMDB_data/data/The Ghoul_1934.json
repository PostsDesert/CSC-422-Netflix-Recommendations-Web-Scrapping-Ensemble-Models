Then strange and spooky things happen. I actually enjoy this clich√©d scenario with horror films.\n\nThis one is cute. It's sometimes funny, sometimes interesting, sometimes with neat imagery. The story of course is nothing special but it's a fun movie to watch. Although it's not a film to seek out but it is one that is pretty good to watch from a film pack or a free copy to view online if you happen upon the film and like older cute \"dark and stormy night\" films.\n\nI would describe this film as a comedy-mystery horror - and if you like that kind of movie then you might like this one.\n\n6/10",
