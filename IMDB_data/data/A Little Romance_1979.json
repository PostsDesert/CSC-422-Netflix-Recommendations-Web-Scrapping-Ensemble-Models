        "reviewBody": "I first saw this movie in 1979. I loved it then and it has not lost any of it's magic 37 years later. Lane and Bernard are sweet and captivating and of course Sir Laurence Olivier gives another wonderful performance in his long distinguished career. Like many who saw this movie so many years ago, I often wondered what ever became of the young actor who portrayed Daniel. Apparently he decided that acting was not a profession he would continue to pursue as I have recently discovered, ashame that he did'nt do more. The award winning score to this movie by Georges DeLarue is probably the movies greatest triumph, for without it the story may not have come across with quite the power that it did. This movie is a real blessing!",
