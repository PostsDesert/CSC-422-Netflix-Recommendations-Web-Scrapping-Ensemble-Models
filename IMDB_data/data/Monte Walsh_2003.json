        "reviewBody": "I dearly loved the original \"Monte Walsh\" (1970), starring Lee Marvin, Jeanne Moreau and Jack Palance. That was one of the best westerns (and best movies) I've ever seen.\n\nThis version, a more modern telling of the same story, is also quite good, but I found it lacking in the \"grit and dirt\" of the earlier one. Tom Selleck is convincing enough as a cowboy, but unfortunately he still has that \"just stepped out of the pages of GQ magazine\" aura to him that I don't think he is ever going to shake. There is nothing wrong with being as handsome as Tom Selleck, it's just that I found it hard to feel totally convinced of his portrayal of an authentic, hard-scrabble cowboy of the dying Old West.\n\nI felt that too much attention was devoted to making it all so \"pretty pretty\" instead of letting it gather a patina of cow dung, as must have been the case in the *real* old West. Here the cowboy costumes were a bit too gorgeous and hokey to be convincing, and the cinematography, while breathtakingly beautiful, seemed distracting, as if it were all a travel-documentary. It all seems to have been \"made for TV\" sanitized, giving it more style than atmosphere.\n\nBut I'm being too critical here, and I don't want to spoil a good film by being unnecessarily nit-picky. All said, it's really a good movie with a powerful, timeless story about people losing their way of life thanks to rapid technological progress and corporate cynicism. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? I would recommend this film to any die-hard western movie fan, but please try to pick up a copy of the earlier 1970 version, and watch that one as well. The West is the Best, bar none."
