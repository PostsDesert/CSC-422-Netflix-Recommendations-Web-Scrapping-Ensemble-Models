The location of this adaptation has been changed to from World War II Hungary to Spain during and immediately after the Civil War. The young boy and main character, as portrayed by Juan Diego Botto (still one of Spain's most promising young actors), seeks to find his mother amidst the turmoil, and discovers the opposite sex on the way. Mature women, Faye Dunaway and Joanna Pacula included, teach him about love and passion, though he stumbles upon girls his own age (Ingrid Rubio star of Carlos Saura's TAXI) once or twice. The film is entertaining and well worth your time. Too bad it was not released in the U.S. or the U.K. Nevertheless, it is now available in video (without English subtitles).",
