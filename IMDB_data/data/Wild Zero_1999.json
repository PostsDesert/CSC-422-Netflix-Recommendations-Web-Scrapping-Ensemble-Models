It will rock your face off.\" They were right. \n\nWild Zero is without a doubt the most amazing Japanese Rock Zombie flick ever. \n\nIf you believe that rock and roll is here to stay, that greasers should roam the streets of Japan, and that extraneous characters should be disposed of as quickly as possible and turned into zombies, then this film is for you.\n\nThe exploding zombie head budget is high in this film, but the writing budget seems to have suffered as a result. With zombie flicks, though, you pay your money and you take your chances."
