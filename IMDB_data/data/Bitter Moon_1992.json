        "reviewBody": "Few critics took this film seriously when it was released, but it's now steadily beginning to garner attention. Today it ranks as one of Polanski's best. \n\n\"Bitter Moon\" is a powerful film about love, and to view it as a sort of a soft-core titillation exercise by Polanski is to miss the point. The up-front sexuality of the film is there, not to merely provoke a cheap arousal from the viewer, but to point out how empty and hollow the couple's relationship really is. Most men will empathise with the morality (or lack of) in this confused relationship between an older man obsessed with his sexual object, and her adoration for him. The haunting reality is that for so many, the lack of depth in a relationship is frightening once the sexual desire diminishes.\n\n9/10 - Filed with lush cinematography and romantic Parisian architecture, the film's only flaw is its Hugh Grant subplot. Everything else is electric, with a dark playfulness that only Polanski can deliver. Worth several viewings.\n\nNote: Peter Coyote's room number, 5A, is the same as Tom Cruise's apartment from \"Eyes Wide Shut\". Both films have similar themes. When \"Eyes Wide Shut\" was released, Polanski made \"The Ninth Gate\", a film which features an \"Eyes Wide Shut\" styled ritual. Both films are similar in tone."
