        "reviewBody": "This is a remake of a story written by Director, Lina Wertmuller. It is the story of Leroy Jones, played very capably by Richard Pryor. Pryor steals the show here as he plays Leroy, a migrant fruit picker, his grouchy old father and the local minister. It is the story of Leroy, and his accidental rise to management. Leroy is manipulated by \"the man\", the president of the Agricultural conglomerate that employs Leroy and his friends. It does a very good job of showing just how one can be seduced by the appearance of power. Leroy loses everything that means anything to him in his rise to management at the \"company\". The segments where Leroy interacts with his \"father\" are too funny for words. Pryor doesn't have a great range of acting ability but what he does, he does the best.",
