        "reviewBody": "If not anything else, \"Without Warning\" proves that a film can be memorable and highly original without being brilliant. This is by no means a masterpiece, but it fully serves its purpose and resembles a punch in the stomach when you least expect it. \n\nDidn't come up with high expectations (found it on YouTube), but the uncertainty building up throughout the film kept me watching. The ending caught me completely off guard. What makes this film so disturbing is that the story unwraps slowly, without being too explicit or over the top. By far one of the most plausible and haunting pieces apocalyptic fiction I've ever seen.",
