        "reviewBody": "There are some redeeming qualities to Tom and Jerry: The Movie. There is a good voice cast, that includes Charlotte Rae, Richard Kind, Dana Hill and Tony Jay. The characters are fairly likable, though there may be times when Aunt Figg might scare children. Tom and Jerry still have their likability, Robyn is a very charming character, and the animation is serviceable on the most part, but shoddy in other places.\n\nHowever, there are a number of things that make this film disappointing. One is the disjointed plot, that has been done better before, and not only that, there is a tendency for it to become unfocused and clumsy. I didn't like the songs either, I found them rather unmelodious and forgettable. The writing wasn't particularly that inspiring, but the biggest disappointment for me was the lack of violence that made the cartoon show such a joy to watch. Instead of the songs, I would've liked to have seen a more focused plot and some violence, so that it could do justice to the show that it took its inspiration from.\n\nOverall, sweet in places, with the occasional likable character, and not awful. But it wasn't at all great, in fact it was disappointing, I just wished it was more faithful to the show. 5/10 for trying. Bethany Cox",
