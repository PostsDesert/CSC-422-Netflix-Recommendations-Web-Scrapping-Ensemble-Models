I must admit that when I saw the movie I just can't stop laughing , Really... It is SO silly and SO Dumb and SO SO low, That it works!!! It did the Job!!!\n\nIn my Hall of fame of trash-comedy-Movies It almost Equals to Jim Carrey \"Dumb and Dumber\" (that after-all does takes the honorably first place).\n\nDon't look for art here, cause you will not find any; Don't mind the plot, don't mind the acting, Don't mind anything about this film - just prepare yourself to waste one and a half hour of your life - take some snacks, sit down, relax and Laugh... (or cry)."
