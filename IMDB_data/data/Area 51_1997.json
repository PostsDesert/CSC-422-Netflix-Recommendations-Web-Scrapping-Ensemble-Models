I have never seen medics manhandle a patient the way these guys handle the \"ALIEN.\" They just run and and wave their flashlights around. They don't seem to examine him at all. Also, the \"ALIEN's\" head doesn't move with any fluidity, like most animals. It seems to jerk unnaturally and move stiffly like a puppet. This is obviously a hoax to try and make money off of a large group of people who want to believe in something fantastic. Don't waste your money. You can see just the video on YouTube. ooh ooh IOU OR ooh ooh coo ooh ooh OR OR IOU IOU ooh Ohio",
