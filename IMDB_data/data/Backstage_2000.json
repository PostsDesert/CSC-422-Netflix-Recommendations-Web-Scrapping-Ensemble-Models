Jay-Z, DMX, Method Man, Redman, Ja Rule and countless others from their respective stables are followed on the road. A mix of live footage and backstage action focusing on the main people involved with the project. It is quite an interesting documentation of what was a big event in hip-hop history, with the 30 plus entourage of rap artists all in one place, almost guaranteed a breeding ground for anarchy and chaos. Most notable scenes include an argument between Damon Dash and Russel Simmons, and a fleeting appearance from \"Pain in da Ass\", the man who used to do the Al Pacino impressions on Jay-Z's albums.",
