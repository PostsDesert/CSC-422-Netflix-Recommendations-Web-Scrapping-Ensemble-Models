Having spent time around the indie music scene for a number of years I can personally attest to the fact that this film is anything but naive.\n\nIt hits the nail right on the head. The music from obscure Ben Lee songs to Ani DiFranco are not only dead on (the film was shot back in the nineties)for the scene but the way the kids act - young and impulsive shows that the filmmakers knew their subjects and refused to make a film that imprinted the ideas and beliefs of 40 year old wannabe film critics.\n\nThe closest film I've seen to this one is probably Penelope Speeris' wonderful film Suburbia from back in the 80's.",
