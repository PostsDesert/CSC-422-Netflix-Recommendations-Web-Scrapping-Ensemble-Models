        "reviewBody": "Potop( the Deluge, in English) is also a story of betrayal by some of the Nobles of Poland who side with Sweden. It is also one part of Henryk Sienkiewicz's Trilogy; the others, also filmed by Hoffman: Pan Wolodyjowski (Colonel Wolodyjowski) and, Ogniem i Mieczem (With Fire and Sword) were released in 1969, and 1999, respectively.\n\nI have been able to find these movies for sale in the US, although they're in Polish, with English subtitles, at Polish import shops, however, I've been unable to find DVDs.\n\nThis movie, as well as the other two mentioned, have some violent scenes, but the violence depicted is not unusual for the time period, and such violence was no stranger to Western European counties such as France, Spain and England.\n\nPotop is a very good action flick based on historical events, see it if you can."
