Like Satya from RGV did.\n\nThe mental sickness of the so called high society is the summary of the movie. In the midst of all the sickness, its difficult to lead a normal life which the protagonist, Konkana Sen, does. Serious movie, not to be watched with children or expecting wives. Page-3 of newspapers is the usual place for reporting the activities going on in the parties of the rich and elite who indulge in much more filth then what is reported. How this Page-3 is also a business prospect is shown in the movie. Event management firms get paid to arrange parties and make a rich but not famous people famous overnight by clicking photographs with the celebrities invited to the party.\n\nThe western culture has crept into the high society of Mumabi quite deeply. The movie shows it boldly, no holds barred.\n\nMadhur Bhandarkar starts a new journey from here.",
