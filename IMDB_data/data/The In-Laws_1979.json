No one does the sort of deadpan face that says \"I can't believe what I'm hearing and seeing\" like Alan Arkin. Peter Falk's comic abilities match his skill in heavier roles. The interplay between them is marvelous, matching that of Lemmon & Matthau (one wishes they had made more films together). Many side-splitting moments, and some superbly comic dialogue. Not to be missed.\n\nSerpentine, Shel, serpentine!!!",
