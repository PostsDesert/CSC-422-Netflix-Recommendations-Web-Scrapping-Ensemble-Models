        "reviewBody": "The story and acting are laughable, but the surfing footage is ALL-TIME great! \n\nMy recommendation is to rent this DVD, turn off the sound, and put on some heavy, loud music. Then just FF to to the wave riding scenes and let your eyes feast on the 35mm footage of GIANT surf riding. It is absolutely mind-blowing. This film contains some of the greatest big wave surfing ever caught on film. \n\nDon't miss the tow-in body-board riding of Mike 'the Wizard\" Stewart. WOW! His '360' maneuver garnered the biggest cheers of the night at the opening showing of this film.\n\nThe acting in this movie is so bad that it is actually pretty funny. Shane Dorian is an amazing surfer, but maybe, just maybe, should stick to his day job. Not sure if Shane will be putting an Oscar on his mantle anytime soon. His opening line drew raucous laughter from a San Diego opening night movie crowd (and it was not supposed to be a funny line).\n\nSo, watch this movie with your favorite heavy music playing. Oh, try to watch it on a big screen."
