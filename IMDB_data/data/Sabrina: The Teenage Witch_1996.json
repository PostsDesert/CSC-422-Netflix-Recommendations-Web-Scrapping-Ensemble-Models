The show is funny, Sabrina is so cute and fun, and Salem is pretty witty. If I could, I would watch Sabrina every day (which I practically can since it is on every day but Sunday) but still, it hardly seems like enough. It is on a newer channel (to me anyways) called the N and now there are new shows on that channel that I hope to god don't replace Sabrina. Not unless all 7 seasons come out on DVD-which they really, really should! I looked on e-bay for Sabrina stuff and bought the original movie (it is on its way), but other than that, there wasn't enough. So really Sabrina's only flaw is that they haven't made enough for the loyal viewer to buy!"
