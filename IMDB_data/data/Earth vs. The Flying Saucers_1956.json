        "reviewBody": "Ray Harryhausen developed the flying saucers for this film, and they are worth seeing to be sure. The story is about how a space creature has contacted a professor on Earth, played nicely by Hugh Marlowe, and wants him to talk to his leaders. When there is a communication problem, the aliens destroy a rocket base. In short time, the aliens let the Earth and its people know that their intent is to take over the planet. Marlowe, working in conjunction with the military, develops a machine which renders the space ships incapable of straight flight. The film is a prime example of what good science fiction is all about. It has tension, extraterrestrials, fast pacing, and good special effects for its day. This film is very suspenseful and well worth a look."
