        "reviewBody": "While clearly not at the creative peak for the band, the show itself was spectacular, which if you've been lucky enough to see them live is a standard. The \"Big Eyed Fish\" is absolutely great. The Lovely Ladies are prominent, to my dismay. Not their best DVD, see Central Park or the bonus Gorge DVD, but it's still Dave and they are the greatest. Take a watch and see how much fun a band can have on stage playing great music well. The video quality and sound quality are fantastic as one would expect from a band that records much near everything they perform. Dave fans should have this already and music fans should know this band and give this a watch.",
