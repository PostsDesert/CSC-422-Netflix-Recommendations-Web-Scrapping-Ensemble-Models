        "reviewBody": "Die Another Day (2002) \n\n** (out of 4)\n\nPierce Brosnan's fourth and final appearance as James Bond has the spy trying to connect the dots between a North Korean terrorist and a diamond mogul. I understand this film has its fans but to me this here is a complete misfire and certainly the worst of the four Brosnan pictures. I'm really not sure where to start because I didn't find too much to enjoy here. I think there are several major problems but we can start with the screenplay, which I thought had some really dumb ideas. I never once got caught up in the entire plot dealing with what the bad guys were trying to do. I found it to be rather boring and it seemed like a plot that would have worked much better in an alien movie. I also didn't care too much for any of the villains this time out and I think they could go down as some of the least interesting in the entire series. Finally, I think a lot of blame needs to go to director Lee Tamahori who simply adds no excitement or thrills to the picture. The lack of any real energy is very noticeable especially considering how well done the previous movie was. No, I'm not done with the bashing. I thought the opening pre-credit sequence was rather boring, the Madonna theme song was downright horrid and didn't fit the picture (or series) and her cameo really isn't any better. Brosnan is good, as usual, but this here is a given. Halle Berry's body and swimsuit certainly steal the show but I thought she was much too good for this role. DIE ANOTHER DAY isn't so bad to where you can't sit through it but at the same time there's no question this is a very weak film. And lets not even get started on the really bad CGI effects."
