We need more of this today . It is so nice not to hear profanity and not have to see explicit displays of obscene and lewd sexual behavior in this fine movie . Hollywood is not doing it's part for America today as all they are interested is money and ratings . The public sends them a message and they give us the finger . I hope I can live long enough to see the return of desency to all forms of broadcasting . I suppose we will always have smut but it does not have to be the norm ..!! I thank you for opportunity to comment and I hope this is a positive contribution."
