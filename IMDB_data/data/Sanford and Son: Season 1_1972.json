        "reviewBody": "Highly hilarious and dominant television show from the mid-1970s that continues to have a great following even today (despite some detractors who take the show way too seriously). California African-American widower/junk dealer Redd Foxx (one of the most under-rated entertainers of his time) and his only son (Demond Wilson) argued and got into every odd-ball situation one could fathom during their six years in prime-time (from 1972-1977). The series was an answer to \"All in the Family\". It showed the differences and similarities between white blue-collar society and the working class African-American. It also was a coast war as \"All in the Family\" took place on the Atlantic shore while \"Sanford and Son\" took place on the Pacific. The supporting cast (led by the priceless LaWanda Page as Foxx's sister-in-law) was used in well-calculated ways to add to the program's comedic momentum. Never dull, never slow, never boring and never sorry, \"Sanford and Son\" is one of those shows that just seems to stand the test of time. 5 stars out of 5."
