        "reviewBody": "Growing up in a small town in the Great Lakes Region, made this movie a lot of fun, as I was reminded of fun times in my hometown around Halloween. This is a movie dominated by Christopher Lloyd, who takes over the minute his character is introduced. If you enjoy this actor in movies like Back to the Future or his time on the classic TV show Taxi, you will probably enjoy this movie also. Lloyd's character is a bit eccentric, and the interaction between he and his Grandson makes for a lot of laughs. There is also the classic big bully, picking on the underdog little kid, who must overcome his fears in the end. The movie starts to drag about 30 minutes into it, but when the zombies, spooks and ghouls come out to play, the fun kicks back into gear. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys sitting with the kids and watching a fairly wholesome family show.",
