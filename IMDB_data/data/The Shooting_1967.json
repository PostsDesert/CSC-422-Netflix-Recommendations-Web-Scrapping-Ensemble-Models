        "reviewBody": "When ranking The Inspector cartoons, thirty four in number between 1965 and 1969 courtesy of DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, 'The Shooting of Caribou Lou' is to me one of the better-faring ones. Not disparaging the series in any way saying that, not all the cartoons are great but the series on the most part is good fun and one of DePatie-Freleng Enterprises' better theatrical series along with those for Pink Panther and The Ant and the Aardvark.\n\n'The Shooting of Caribou Lou' is one of those good fun cartoons, both from the series and animation in general. At the same time it's not one that bowled me over, 'The Shooting of Caribou Lou' is more amusing than hilarious and the gags could have been more in number and they could have been a little fresher, but it does entertain, has nice conflict and that The Inspector himself is a compelling character helps make his series more than watchable.\n\nStory-wise, 'The Shooting of Caribou Lou' has one of the more interesting premises for The Inspector series and mostly executes it quite well, with it still being amusing and the Inspector and Caribou Lou are strong enough characters to carry the cartoon. As said above though, the execution could have been even fresher with more variety and surprises.\n\nPacing could have been tighter occasionally perhaps, particularly briefly in the middle, though the cartoon is full of a great bubbly energy.\n\nAnimation however is simple but colourful and charming in its simplicity. The music is typically slinky and jaunty. The voice acting is well done, Pat Harrington Jr does not disappoint and captures The Inspector's bumbling and irony to entertaining effect. Mark Skor clearly sounds like he was having fun voicing Caribou Lou.\n\nMore often than not, 'The Shooting of Caribou Lou' is very amusing and the gags are timed well. The dialogue has some great interplay between the two characters. The ending was not a predictable one and did bring a smile to my face. The Inspector's bumbling is not overdone, the physical comedy sharp enough and the irony is hardly neglected. Have always liked the character of The Inspector, and 'The Shooting of Caribou Lou' does nothing to change my mind. Caribou Lou himself is one of the better opponents of the later The Inspector cartoons in my mind, he may look little but his personality is big.\n\nOverall, doesn't blow the mind but a lot to enjoy still. 7/10",
