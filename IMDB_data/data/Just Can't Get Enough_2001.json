Given the fact that I worked ( believe me I'm not bragging) at Chippendales briefly back in 1983 -1984, I must say that although the story was close, it really missed the mark. It failed to capture the true meaning of what \"IT\" was all about. IT being CHIPPENDALES. The last true Soddom and Gomorrah.\n\nThe depiction of Somen \"Steve\" Banerjee (The Owner) and the way his character was written, failed to capture the inner demon lurking behind the soft and unassuming facade that he perpetrated so well. Although the acting was fair, the direction and writing did an injustice to the essence of what IT was ALL about. Maybe I should write the TRUE STORY."
