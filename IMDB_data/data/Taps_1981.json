        "reviewBody": "'Taps' is an uneven film, burdened somewhat by its ponderousness and pathological seriousness. But what a time capsule!\n\nOf all of the young actors here, only Timothy Hutton was already a star, having become the youngest actor ever to win an Oscar for his role in Robert Redford's 'Ordinary People.' Ironically, among the suporting actors in 'Taps' are Tom Cruise and Sean Penn, one of whom has become the biggest box office draw of his generation and the other its most respected acting talent. Also featured are Evan Handler, best-known as Harry Goldenblatt (Charlotte's divorce lawyer and second husband) on TV's 'Sex and the City,' and Spike Lee favorite Giancarlo Esposito, whose credits include 'The Usual Suspects' and the much-underappreciated TV series 'Homicide: Life on the Streets.'\n\nEven if you find 'Taps' a little overblown and pretentious, it's worth watching to see these accomplished actors back in their baby-faced teens."
