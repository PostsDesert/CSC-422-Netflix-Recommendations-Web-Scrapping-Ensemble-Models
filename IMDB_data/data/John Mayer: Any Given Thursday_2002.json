        "reviewBody": "There's definitely something very catchy about this film. John is multi-talented: great songwriter, great musician, humorist, philosopher. Extremely entertaining.\n\nHowever, there's a huge minus that ruins this for me: his voice. No, he's not off-key, but his voice is so scratchy, that it's impossible for me to enjoy it. He sounds like he has laryngitis. He can barely sing with his voice in this condition. I would not pay to hear someone perform with their voice in this condition, and I think it's a big chutzpah for him to charge people admission.\n\nUnderstand: I enjoy singers like Robert Plant, Jon Anderson, Steve Tyler. Their voices may be scratchy -- but they still have some body. John's thin voice is painful for me to listen to."
