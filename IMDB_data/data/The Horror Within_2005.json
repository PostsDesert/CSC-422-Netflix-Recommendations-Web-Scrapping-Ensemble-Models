The house also happens to contain Nick, a vamiperic caretaker who's more then glad to have such delectable morsels show up on his doorstep. It's up to them to survive until daylight.\n\nLow-budget vamp flicks are a dime a dozen and most of them are horrid. This definitely falls in that category. Due to the awful acting, horrible (lack of) story, and sub-par special effects. Nothing original at all happens in this movie and you've seen variations of it in other (much) better ones. My advice is to skip this flick, as the Horror Within this flick is excruciatingly bad.\n\nEye Candy: Michelle Craine gets topless multiple times; an unknown extra also flashes tit \n\nMy Grade: D- \n\nWhere I saw it: Netflix on Demand",
