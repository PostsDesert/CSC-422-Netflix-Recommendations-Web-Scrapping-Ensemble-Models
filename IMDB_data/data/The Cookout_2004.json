        "reviewBody": "All ethnic groups have to suffer under various stereotypes, especially in \"entertainment\". After all, lampooning is a long-lived trope. That doesn't mean you can't take that stereotype and do something good, meaningful, entertaining, funny or informed with it. This movie most emphatically does none of those things. And the sad part is that there are good actors working here,like one of Farrah Fawcett's last roles, or Danny Glover or. Tim Meadows. Or Jennifer Lewis. Instead, this is a bad mishmosh of racist stereotypes, overacted-by-underactor humorless \"jokes\" and negative sexist characterizations. Just so you know, this was to be a \"star vehicle\" for \"Storm P\". I know you've heard of him. Right? Right? Yeah, neither had I and just as well. Oh, to give the movie \"street cred\" it also has Ja Rule. Yay, right? All I can say is that as insulting as some (not all) '70s blaxploitation flicks were, this isn't even the underarm hair thereof.",
