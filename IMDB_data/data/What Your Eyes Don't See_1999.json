Ojos Que No Ven, is as a film an utter failure, with characters as flawed as a Chinese hot Luois Vutton bag purchased in the village. The funniest part of it is the detective who totally rips Columbo off and goes for his smoke in my eyes grin, chain smokes and pretends he is a badass while slowly solving a generic crime that involves all the usual suspects, to that add terrible acting, and you get something really, really, really unoriginal. This should be avoided and never mistaken with the Peruvian film firected by the always reliable Francisco Lombardi, whos Ojos QUe No Ven is not only more intelligent but real.",
