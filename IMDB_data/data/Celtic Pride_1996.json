Its unbelievable that there are grown men with supposed educational degrees out there that think the simplest plot synopsis of this movie can actually fly. Bring your barf suppresant and thank me later.\n\n This woof of a movie presents dan aykroyd and daniel stern who could shoot their agents and rightfully receive congressional medals of honor. Even damon wayans, the least antagonistic ingredient in this ghastly contrived slop, doesnt deserve the painful placement of hackened actor turned hero in the end.\n\nThere is no simply no reason for anyone who isnt under the tutelage of leopold von sacher-masoch to view this movie. If you havent seen this movie, consider yourself blessed and depart yourself forever from it.\n\nA negative 5 stars."
