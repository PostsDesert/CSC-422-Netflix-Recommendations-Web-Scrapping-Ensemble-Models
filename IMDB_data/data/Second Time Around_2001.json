Like in Donny Darko, there's a time tunnel, future and past merging, regrets, etc. The Chinese themes helped me identify with it: Asian guy, unlucky with women, gambling obsession, weirdness with gay people, in love with the cute Asian girl.\n\nThe main Character, Ren, is macho and self confident to a fault. He doesn't value his friends; he is impulsive and messes around with the ladies. Living day by day, not caring about anyone but himself. But this weird car accident and memory SNAFU give him a second chance, and the story unfolds around his change of conscience and a quirky love story.\n\nIt also reminds me a little of Memento. I don't think its very much like Groundhog Day, like the other reviewer... not that comic. Time is used as a ploy to deal with the main theme, which I think is regret.\n\nI enjoyed the suspended disbelief, partly because it was a bit cheesy. And I do love casino scenes, so that helped me enjoy it.\n\nI gave it a 9 out of 10. -hc",
