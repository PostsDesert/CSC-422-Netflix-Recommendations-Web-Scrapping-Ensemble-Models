        "reviewBody": "Tarzan and the Lost City was a failed attempt to bring the Lord of the Apes into the 90s. Caspar Van Dien was physically imposing as John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, and his loincloth-clothed alter ego, but he is just not a good enough actor to bring Burroughs' real character to the screen. The special effects were well made, but trite and really not needed, and the villains were never a good match for Tarzan, a man physically capable of doing just about anything. Jane March is attractive, but in a more British sort of way, which really doesn't translate well to American movie-going audiences."
