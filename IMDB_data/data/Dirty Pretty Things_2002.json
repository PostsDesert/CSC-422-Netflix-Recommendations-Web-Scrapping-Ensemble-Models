Other reviewers have given away the major elements of the plot which may mean that you may find that it takes time to \"cut to the chase\" if you read the comments here before you see it. You are better off seeing this film \"cold\" knowing neither the plot nor the players. It does tend to get a bit goarey towards the end, but not without reason. A well written, superbly acted (especially by the two leads) and expertly directed work that makes you continue to believe that cinema can still be political and make important points without hitting you over the head with a blunt instrument. My only minor crib would be the accents which can be difficult to decipher or in Tatou's case slightly off (her character is supposed to be Turkish but the accent is more Eastern European)."
