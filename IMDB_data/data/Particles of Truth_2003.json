        "reviewBody": "In late June, I was fortunate enough to attend the IFP Los Angeles Film Festival. I saw many films at the festival, however only one film had promise, purpose and power. \"Particles of Truth\" is a cinematically poetic film, which delves into humanity's weakest yet most prevalent characteristics: self-doubt and insecurity. Rarely can a film simultaneously evoke opposing emotions of joy and depression. Nevertheless, \"Particles of Truth\" successfully masters this formula. Director and co-star, Jennifer Elster allowed me to search my inner self. The characters are so deep and personable; I truly felt a connection to each of their fears, flaws and hopes.\n\nI highly recommend this film to anyone who is disgusted with Hollywood's phony and artificial portrayal of life. \"Particles of Truth\" is a real movie, with true characters and authentic resolution.",
