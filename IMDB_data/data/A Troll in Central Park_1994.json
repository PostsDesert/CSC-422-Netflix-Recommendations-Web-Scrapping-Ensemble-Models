        "reviewBody": "A Troll in Central Park was a decent film. It wasn't bad. It was musical, colourful and I liked the characters, but this film had its share of mistakes. It was really slow paced and the action didn't happen until much later towards the end of the film. It would've been far better if the battle with the evil troll queen happened sooner rather than later. I also feel they could've added more to the plot, especially with the characters and some of the development. This film was good, but I can see it had so much potential, but simply didn't live up to expectations. Overall, it was a decent film, but it definitely wasn't one of Don Bluth's best films that's for sure.",
