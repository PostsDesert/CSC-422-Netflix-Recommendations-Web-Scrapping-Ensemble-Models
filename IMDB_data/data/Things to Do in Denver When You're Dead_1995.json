        "name": "Better than most 1990s Tarantino knock-offs, mostly thanks to the cast",
        "reviewBody": "Following the success of \"Reservoir Dogs\" (1992) and \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994), there were a slew of quirky (and violent) crime films. Most of them were pretty awful (\"2 Days in the Valley\" \"Lucky Number Slevin\") and some that were pretty excellent (\"Get Shorty\" \"Grosse Pointe Blank\" \"Go\"). \"Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead\" falls somewhere in between. The film was written by Scott Rosenberg, who's written solid entertainment like \"Con Air\" and \"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\" to duds like \"Kangaroo Jack\" and the \"Gone in Sixty Seconds\" remake. The script on it's own probably falls into the the lesser half of Tarantino knock-offs, but an excellent cast (Andy Garc√≠a, Christopher Lloyd, Treat Williams, Bill Nunn, Jack Warden, Steve Buscemi, Christopher Walken, Fairuza Balk, Gabrielle Anwar, Bill Cobbs, Glenn Plummer, Don Cheadle, and Tiny Lister) greatly elevate the material. The story follows Jimmy the Saint (Garcia) as he puts together a disparate crew of quirky criminals (i.e.Lloyd has appendages falling off and Williams uses bodies at the funeral parlor he works at as as punching bags) on a job that, as you'd expect, goes all wrong. The film does have it's moments. Williams and Nunn cursing each other out in a Resturant while birthday-hat-wearing children look on in stunned silence is pretty funny. Williams as the unpredictable and off kilter Critical Bill is probably the best part of the film. A close second is a doomed romance between Garcia and Anwar. However, the film's script is really just trying too hark in it's attempt to be cool and quirky. The narration by the great Jack Warden seemed particularly pretentious. Overall, there are better films to choose from if you're wanting 90s style Tarantino rip-offs, but if you like the cast here (which I do greatly), you'll probably enjoy \"Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead.\"",
