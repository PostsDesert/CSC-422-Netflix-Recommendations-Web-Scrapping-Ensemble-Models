        "reviewBody": "YESTERDAY is one of the many South Korean movies that have stepped up to the plate visually speaking, but its biggest obstacle is that it's still a South Korean movie. The result is extremely well done special effects coupled with low-energy acting more suitable for dramas, not a sci-fi movie about exploding buildings and wild gunfights.\n\nThe movie works on an action level, because the actors are not required to \"act\". When the drama kicks in, the movie is so low-energy that it's hard to sit through the scenes without falling asleep.\n\nA good idea ruined by some unsuitable acting style. Some more urgency would have helped tremendously. In the end, the blame goes to the director, who failed to inform his actors that they were in a sci-fi film, not an arthouse drama.\n\n5 out of 10\n\n(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this movie or reviews of other foreign films)",
