I did not really enjoy some of the mysterious magical effects, but it was still great, if a bit cheesy. I thought all in all, it was great. If I had to watch it again, I would not mind. It was, definitely, a straight to video type film. It had cheesy qualities, and did not have too great effects. Rodney is pushing 80 and just plain couldn't deliver like he used to. But I still liked it. Time one a look at me i know what I'm doing, Bwahahahahahahaah. Midnight, foresight, the clock has run out, we're going past midnight. \n\nDaft Punk - Around the World\n\naround the world, around the world (x 54)\n\nOne two three. You cannot escape the cube.",
