        "reviewBody": "I love this movie. When I began renting exclusively horror movies in the late eighties I'd rent movies like The Seven Brothers Meet Dracula and Monster Club and The House That Dripped Blood... and eventually I realized they were all by the same director, Roy Ward Baker. What stands out in his fillms to me is the colors. He goes for some really bold color choices. Monster Club is a funny movie. The musical interludes betw2een the vignettes are pretty damn snappy f you've heard them a hundred times, and I have. The stories are good. The dippy costumes are effective and fun. I saw it hosted by Elvira Mistress of the Dark and that made a lot of difference but it's a good movie with or without her breastesses.",
