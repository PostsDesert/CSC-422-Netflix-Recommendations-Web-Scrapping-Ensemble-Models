That makes it interesting each time you watch it.\n\nFor instance, there is this scene when Amir meets some Union leader, and takes his cigerette to light up a Bidi, lights the Bidi, and returns the Bidi to the other guy, and keeps the cigerette with him!\n\nThere are so many more funny and subtle adsurdities going on throughout the movie.. \n\nThe only portion I keep on fast-forwarding even now, is the song in the bus.. \n\nI think although the movie was a flop on the box-office, it still is a huge hit in the home rentals, although large scale piracy would have meant that the producers didn't really earn much from it."
