        "reviewBody": "Along with the American series Columbo, A Touch of Frost is a truly excellant drama. Frost is exactly how you'd imagine a real life Detective Inspector to be.\n\nThe cases which Frost investigates are truly thrilling. There are so many twists and turns in the plot you can never be sure who is guilty and who is innocent. Frost is all about systematic police work and just like Columbo, the reason for Frost's success is the superb storylines. It's great to see Frost methodically trying to solve a case with good old fashioned police work. Frost is no man of action but the superb detective work more than makes up for the ommission of any action scenes.\n\nThe other thing that is vital to Frost is the humour particularly in scenes between Frost and Superintendent Mullett.\n\nAll in all, one of the greatest detective dramas ever."
