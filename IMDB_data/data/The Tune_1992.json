        "reviewBody": "\"The Tune\" is amazing, a fantastic blend of low-quality animation and hilariously ridiculous songs. The characters are the most amazing ever seen-- doggy Elvis, a cab driver without a nose, a bellhop with a very large streak of sadism... they're all memorable head to toe. Perhaps the best moment in the movie involves Del's girlfriend Didi filing music notes (\"C sharp... B flat....\") What's not to like? Any movie that features a hot dog and a hot dog bun running towards each other in a meadow in slow motion is okay by me. The movie ranks in the pantheon of great cartoons with \"Dilbert,\" \"Family Guy,\" and even \"The Sword in the Stone.\" If you're looking for a safe, boring, sane award-winner, \"The Tune\" is definitely not for you!",
