Milk and Money is offbeat and quirky, but cute and rather humorous throughout. Calista Flockhart is beguiling. Denise Faye is extremely sexy -- and Dina Merrill is a legendary supporting actress. Together, they are the primary women surrounding the main character, David. Milk and Money is not worth the ticket price at a movie theatre, but I would watch again on another lazy Sunday afternoon."
