        "reviewBody": "When Leon Uris's novel came out the American public was excited by the story it contained -- one that reflected historical truths placed into an equally romantic and exciting story.\n\nA handsome and daring male lead, a strong and beautiful woman whose ideas and ideals are constantly being challenged. A people struggling for survival against a myriad of enemies.\n\nAdd to that beautiful location shooting all done in the actual locations of Israel and Cyprus, a memorable score and big name stars, this film has much to offer.\n\nBut finding it today is difficult. (I had to search out a Blu Ray created for the Australian market -- but thankfully playable on a US player) One can only assume that the non-politically correct idea of seeing 'goodness' in the creation of a Jewish State and all that has followed it as the reason why.\n\nNo, this is not a \"great\" film. Its length gets in the way of that - - and such with much cut from the original novel. But \"good\" it is. Definitely worth seeing. \n\nWell, if you can find it.",
